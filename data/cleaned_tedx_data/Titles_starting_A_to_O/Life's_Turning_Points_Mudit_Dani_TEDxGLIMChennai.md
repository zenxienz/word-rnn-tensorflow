it was the summer of 2006 when my
maternal grandmother was to undergo a
heart surgery to give her company my
cousins and I moved in with her we spent
many hot summer afternoons playing table
tennis also known as ping pong in the
recreational room of a building one day
her friend came to visit her
he saw us play and even told me I played
quite well but I took this extremely
lightly and just forgot about it
later that night when I was speaking to
my grandmom she told me he was none
other than X National table tennis coach
mr. ratty shattered my eyes lit up when
she also told me that he had offered to
train me
the high-speed spins and different
styles of the game fascinated me and I
took up this offer at once cha-cha-cha
as I fondly called him often wore his
India team t-shirts when he came to
train me he also told me many stories of
his days representing India these
stories would have inspired anyone but
the most and biggest inspiration was
when on my birthday he surprised me with
the precious gift of the India Blazer he
had worn to the World Championships I
opened it in front of him and saw it
incomplete all I realized it wasn&#39;t my
size and that&#39;s when I had decided that
I wouldn&#39;t wear one until I had owned
one of my own so I framed it I kept it
on my bedroom wall
I saw it each morning when I woke up
every afternoon when I came back from
school and it was also the last thing I
saw before going to bed each night
this blazer resonated with my dreams of
representing India every time I saw it
and realized I didn&#39;t have one of my own
it made me itch this is when my India
dream was born and that was the first
turning point in my life
in 2012 I injured my shoulder blade
despite extensive physiotherapy the pain
wasn&#39;t subsiding it had already been
over a month since I had last held my
racket I felt extremely restless as I
wasn&#39;t even able to do basic daily
activities such as drink a glass of
water or pick up my books what followed
were more fruitless visits to various
physiotherapists as an optimistic 13
year old I decided that I was going to
fight this out there was only one option
left
I totally hated it but I decided that I
would do yoga with the help of my
paternal grandmother I got to visit Sri
bks iyengar ji in his Yoga Center in
Pune as I walked in the class I saw
people of various ages contorted into
seemingly impossible yoga asanas just
like them
he also made me hang upside down do back
arches even though he knew how bad my
shoulder was I just couldn&#39;t hold it in
anymore I cried in front of 200 people
it wasn&#39;t just the physical pain but
also the mental agony of the thought
what if I could never play table tennis
again after a few more sessions my
shoulder seemed to be getting better he
told me to continue practicing with my
grandmom at home after a few weeks of
practicing at home and a lot more tears
I was finally strong enough to get back
onto the table I yet remember the first
day when I started to play again hearing
that ping pong sound of the ball was
magical from twice a week to four times
the six I stepped up my routine and
within six months I was announced
captain of the state junior team for the
Nationals I led the team to a silver at
the Nationals all this wouldn&#39;t have
been possible without the whole yoga
experience and that was another turning
point in my life I also knew that all
this wasn&#39;t possible without the help of
my grandmom
no wonder they say your grandparents are
even more special than your own parents
2014 I was representing India at the
world junior circuit open in El Salvador
my 6 a.m. alarm rang and I was soon in
the gym for my warm-up run and
stretching routine post-breakfast
I made my way to the stadium there
seemed to be something special about
that day as I walked into the changing
room I opened my bag I chose the t-shirt
at plain I held it in front of me mother
Donny
India I had never read these three words
so slowly carefully or mindfully before
that&#39;s when I wore the t-shirt pride
filled me in and I walked out of the
changing room with my head held high
just like the previous night the coach
revised the game tactics with me
there was just one hour to go for my
first international singles final there
was nothing more I wanted than to win a
maid
Gold for India as I shut my eyes for a
split second and entered the arena
I could hear a faint chant though India
India India and that&#39;s when I remembered
the 2011 Cricket World Cup finals in
Mumbai my finals started well and I won
the first two games I was just one set
away from winning my first international
gold I even got the lead in the third
game but I lost it and eventually even
lost the game
my coach sensed I was playing a little
passively so from the other side of the
stadium he signaled to me with his hand
like a big TV that&#39;s when I realized it
was 4 a.m. in India but my friend&#39;s
family
Federation officials and many more were
watching the game on a live internet
stream that&#39;s when it dawned upon me
that I was not only responsible for
myself but for the entire nation I
started the fourth game well and took
the lead at once more my coach saw that
excitement was written all over my face
he kept telling me to keep calm
I must confess it was incredibly
difficult but it seems like I could hold
my no as I went on to win the game 11
eight and fell to the floor in
excitement there were screams and chants
and the noise level hit the roof but the
most heartening of all was seeing the
coach running from across the hall with
his arms wide open
holding the Indian national flag I
couldn&#39;t resist
but take the flag with me on to the
podium Madani followed by India and soon
my first international goal was around
my neck but the best was yet to come
about 50 meters across the hall
the marching had stopped the band was
silent the national anthem began to play
as I sang each word of our national
anthem I was closer to tearing up soon
the flag was in clear sight that&#39;s when
I got a flashback of all my life&#39;s
turning points chartered saw handing me
the India blazer during the Pune for
yoga therapy representing India for the
first time as I continued to sing the
national anthem tears roll down my face
everything seemed so worth it right then
there was nothing more I wanted as the
flag grows higher and higher nothing
made me more proud than to see our flag
to be the highest of all three what made
this moment even more special was the
timing 15 August 2014
winning India&#39;s winning a gold for India
on India 67th Independence Day as I
heard the national anthem play on
foreign soil as the entire crowd rose in
attention and respect of our anthem and
a flag there&#39;s nothing more I could ever
ask for
the good performances continued as I
went on to win 22 medals for India that
led to an all-time high of number 10 on
the global junior circuit standings each
medal and tournament had a unique charm
but my unique identity has been built by
experiencing the various dawning points
during this journey of table tennis what
if I had not taken up charge sores awful
what if I was never able to play table
tennis after my injury I wouldn&#39;t have
won all the medals but more importantly
I wouldn&#39;t have been able to experience
the life lessons that have shaped Who I
am today I&#39;m sure each and every one of
you has experiences loved ones and small
incidents that can change your life
today I want all of you to please notice
these small things around you I want you
to be able to value the things that you
may think are small but may become a
turning point in your life there have
been many turning points that all of you
guys would have endured in your life and
be ready to embrace the futures turning
points as these are the only moments
that will lead you to your one moment
thank you
