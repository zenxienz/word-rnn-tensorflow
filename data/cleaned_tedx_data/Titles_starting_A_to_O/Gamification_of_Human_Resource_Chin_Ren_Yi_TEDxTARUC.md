hi guys good afternoon and we behave and
you clap a lot that might be three
burgers all right so my name is Ronnie
the co-founders at my burger lab and I
call myself an accidental entrepreneur
I&#39;m gonna be sharing a little bit about
how we build our team and how we have
survived the last five years just hiring
part-timers
there are students just like you guys
all right so I&#39;m not too sure how I&#39;m
gonna top the previous show but I would
I would try all right there we go
so what is an accidental entrepreneur
well the way I see it I did not set up
on this journey on purpose I studied to
be a mechanical engineering I graduated
from Hawaii did you think what idea I
didn&#39;t want to work for someone else I
knew I wanted to do my own thing while I
was studying I was working in different
restaurants different cafes just gaining
experience spending a little more money
for myself but one thing I found was
that I like doing that I like serving
people I was good at it and I say you
know what when I graduate I&#39;m gonna try
to open up my own cafe I think everyone
here has a dream of opening up that one
cafe one day right and it&#39;s a nice dream
and I say you don&#39;t want to quite quite
wait till I retire like wait till you
know in my forties or fifties and then
only I opened my own cafe why not doing
now so that dream kind of evolved from a
cafe into a burger joint I&#39;m not gonna
bore you that part of story because I
only have 18 minutes but in the last
five years we have accidentally become
very famous and why am we famous apart
from the good food and a good service
that we serve another thing that we&#39;re
famous for is we hire specifically young
people only so over the last five years
we have happier as many as eight hundred
plus part-timers and if I can be seen to
have this kind of numbers when you near
powerless is insane everyone has told us
what you do what you&#39;re doing right now
it doesn&#39;t make sense because when you
work
as a business when you&#39;re running a
business you want something that&#39;s
sustainable you want something that can
last you want as little turnover as
possible you want your stuff to stay
forever however I felt that there was
something missing in every industry in
Malaysia I felt that there was a sense
there was an echo soul a lack of
ownership in the people that&#39;s working
in the store and I was working in the
States for a bit during my studying
years and that was something that was
very unique in in u.s. when you work as
a waiter
you get tips and the Pens of you are
serving people the wall people take you
and i say why pass service just be free
must be motivated multi-bit what
motivated by money is there anything
else greater than that so we came back I
came back and I said you know what how
much our restaurant so I wrote in two of
my best naive friends say guys gonna
start a business together and it&#39;s like
sure and you know that was that was
basically the end of it they had a
little money I knew that my book my
partner&#39;s coming and we get our chummy
was they to worry you know if he needs
to get things done he get things done we
get he&#39;s the numbers guy he&#39;s good at
business and I am the dreamer I do fun
things okay trying to do things and then
I get we get the missions available so
that&#39;s how I came about so this picture
was taken about three years ago all
right one of our outlets what about New
Year parties and this is just a small
fraction of the people that work with us
about again okay that basis they are
people like you we have architects we
have business students we have engineers
doctors all working well I mean students
working together with us while they get
a degree now of course we focus a lot on
making sure they study hard as well it&#39;s
not just hey too much work I don&#39;t care
about your school but we built an
ecosystem now I&#39;m going to share today
I&#39;m going to show you how
the ecosystem and how we maintain it so
what did we learn in this last five
years
number one we need to approach the
thinking in a way where business have
needs and then the people who work for
the business have different needs as
well and we realized that this too needs
don&#39;t always match up what do the
business is want the businesses want
they want someone who has warm
personality they want someone who can
talk to the customers it&#39;s that easy to
find difficult they want something with
mid-level someone with mid-level skill
right sometimes they are even given to
take in people without training and they
train them but when they do that usually
once people get trained they start
leaving for better jobs they want low
turnover they want start to stay forever
and they want as much profit as possible
meaning they want to pay as little as
possible this is what businesses think
now on the staff side what do they want
understand number one they want money
that&#39;s a given everyone works so that
they can survive it they can find things
they want they can go enjoy that self
but a lot of times they also want
something a little bit more than that
they won a second home they were the
place where they can hang out and make
new friends they want a place where they
can learn new skills no unfortunately an
MMB to say hey I&#39;m in a restaurant
your mom is probably gonna say learn
what was there to learn Anatomy all
right some people put on EEMA now that&#39;s
a very stereotypical viewpoint and
that&#39;s okay because not everyone has an
insight into what FME has to offer
so how do we do this sorry how do we put
this tube needs together what the
business one and what a stock one how do
you put them together and I experienced
something really special while working
part time at Starbucks when I was still
in school they gave me ownership they
gave me a sense of ownership they made
me feel like my thought matter they made
me feel like might be the
method but it wasn&#39;t surveys on me the
first day when I went to Starbuck to say
hey congratulations you are now a
Starbucks partner partner I guess shares
up that&#39;s a good ways I know right but
it&#39;s just the name but that gave me a
really deep sense of ownership and I
were popular mine as a student I was
skipping classes to go to Starbucks and
work don&#39;t don&#39;t do that yeah but
thinking back when I started the
business or fiberglass of my experience
that&#39;s not much what made me come in so
much was something as simple as
ownership so I knew that was a secret to
a good successful FMV business give
ownership to the team now a lot of times
when you say that people say hey you
need to give them money you need to do
that with some kind of share know a lot
of it is in the mind giving them a voice
that makes a difference okay so I&#39;m
going to go a little bit deeper into
what we have done so far to make sure
that our team acts the way you we want
them to and also we want to do well
because they feel that they owned the
business as well
all right so how do we train someone
without experience just like this guy
here I think you know from how my just
walks off campus they want them to laugh
so I take it I want to work okay how do
we train someone who has zero experience
at serving and cooking to deal with a
stressful kitchen if you&#39;ve been to
break it up you know that we are very
busy most of the time and even the Train
Coco finding very difficult not very
difficult but we&#39;ll find it stressful in
an environment how do we take someone
without that experience and let them we
used to it and grow out of it how do we
get someone to serve raging customers
right by the way this mean happy is our
friend we&#39;re just waiting for this photo
but how do we get random people we don&#39;t
know how to deal with customers geeks
real gigs or nurse that they you know
the thing on your computer all day long
to social action people so we had to
find a way so the first thing that we
did was instill a culture what it means
to be a my verbal app we call ourself
keeps because we like the inner do you
think that being nerdy is cool because
when you&#39;re not obsess about things you
love information you want to learn and
grow more so we instill a culture what
is the culture cultures are made of
values each of us have baddies right and
your vanity finds you
for example I badly honesty if I meet
someone who is honest I want to be a
friend
I value punctuality if I am supposed to

be here at 1:00 o&#39;clock I gotta be late

today if I&#39;m supposed to be here at 1:00
o&#39;clock okay I would try to be here by
12 45 so that&#39;s my value 10 he finds who
I am
so we say we need to give our gifts
identity what when we must say geeks of
my burger why are they so this other
Wendy&#39;s that we have be welcoming and
sincere be passionate and dedicated be
responsible and accountable be
considerate and respectful be unique and
inventive in knowledgeable and humble
Anissa thanks that you learned in moral
class is you know right but if you work
in a company that doesn&#39;t tell you this
is what we believe in do you think you
will act on it no so it was very
important policy it still approach it to
say I have some everybody this is what
United violet so the next thing that we
give ownership was within still pledges
under daily basis before we start work
they will huddle up and we will give a
pledge to each other
what&#39;s a pledge a pledge is a promise is
a promise to each other to perform to do
better I&#39;m gonna win on the whole pledge
I&#39;m gonna do like the pop of the bottom
the pledge says dear fellow geeks I
promise to strive for excellence in all
I do I promise to treat you with respect
I promise to me Nina i standard of
cleanliness and I promise to be a team
player
and I won&#39;t always have your back so
these are the pledges we do every day
can you say often enough you listen to
your head I mean you&#39;re working this is
the promise that you will feel for your
team so with this with the culture
pledges we have form a team that works
cohesively very well that tries to
improve on themselves online how&#39;s the
basis
next we need to give them a voice that
keeps me to have a voice the staff needs
to have a voice so we have lady three
kings and debriefings where they can
point out their unhappiness hey I wanted
this guy today he wasn&#39;t performing I am
going to tell him in the nice way that
nice people method way right so envious
he knows how to improve and I expected
you to tell me what I did wrong today
so the D prefix r6 on where we are
allowed to speak our mind and to learn
from each other and we what early we
will have town halls where by the gigs
just as in this environment they get to
talk to me they get to tell me hey I
feel that this company the direction is
going wrong I feel that week I should be
doing business that you guys have been
doing that mistake and we listen and
sometimes there were a lot of changes
that we made due to what the keeps have
it back to us because I will never be as
good as the people working on the ground
they hear feedback matters and this
important for us to listen to them and
execute it execute on it where it
matters so this is what we have done
okay over the last four five years cool
nice it is a picture of us doing
anything this do not excite them to them
this is yeah I work here you have me
memorize this you have to do this ok I
do not write what not a bit so the
previous thanks that we can still our
external factors we need internal
motivation right and this is where we
try to give me five your work so we just
instilled something simple s level up
cards ok so if you look at my burger lab
the unique thing about this sorry you
gotta work all stations there&#39;s no such
thing as I&#39;m ready to be a catcher I&#39;m
high need to be a code you then
efficient because I wanted you live I
want you to learn everything alright so
there is total of seven stations from
the server to the cache in yellow over
on the house the hospitality coop to the
coordinator assembly grid on one bill to
and Friday
these are the seven stations that all
geeks most likely would have to go to
now how do you get a card there for
criterias you need to be able to open
run close and teach each of the station
perfectly only then you will be
recognized by the manager and you keep
it a card no you must be thinking just
economy not what is it what does it do
you&#39;ll be surprised
psychologically it&#39;s a form of
acknowledgment I can say hey you&#39;re good
at this
congratulation it doesn&#39;t mean anything
it is more effective when I give you a
card to hold on to or something physical
that represents your hard work your
achievement and with this we started
seeing geeks
pushing themselves always asking
managers hey what can I improve on okay
make you better I need to end this cut I
want to do better and that was an
improvement throughout of all our stores
because all FME has one problem the more
you scale the more that we could just
service a the food becomes that&#39;s the
truth unfortunately that&#39;s why you see a
lot of men choices the more they open
the morning would say yeah not so good
and Ebola but me trying so this is
something that we put in place to make
sure that whoop is fun work is something
to improve on thanked and rewarded for
now this is working can I give me by
experience so sometimes and see we have
shava stop and I need someone from some
way to go to CPAP to help work but what
would incentive by someone from some way
to go to sleep after work so what we did
was we created a card called the
traveler if you travel to end under
stall nine times you order in this time
okay an Amish man of your effort the
next one we help the veteran so some
people might not be so good to look at
power stations and be good at them we&#39;re
all different the main and we all have
different skill set and that&#39;s fine but
I want to reward your loyalty you work
by a hundred hours you get the veteran
card so again making it all fun and you
see even them that acknowledgement helps
now of course at the end of the day this
is just a piece of
take it home you get nothing out of it
so we instill a page here using this car
system right so basically 650 an hour we
went three huh we get seven drink in our
five cars and above seventy an hour hey
Carla I&#39;m sorry some kind of birth in
again our but this incentivizes them to
stay longer to work harder better now
today this is what we have done what I&#39;m
going to show you you right after this
is what I want to do moving forward is a
theory it&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t been
tried before so very mean please
so how deep can we go in terms of can
define work so what I&#39;m doing right now
is some ex parenting with the MP MBTI
personality test what those that a
little bit you know what I&#39;m talking
about but those who are not just go home
Google the myers-briggs Type Indicator
okay you learned a little bit of all
right
and you probably learn a little bit
about yourself as well so one game
starting to do is to get them to stop
doing the MBTI test before they come to
work before their first day in work so
what the enmity Act has does is it it
dictates that all of us can be separated
into sixteen general personality
now these personalities do not define
you they do not say hey because you like
that before header like that know what
it does is it identifies your strengths
and yeah I need advice in the system now
so say for example so I&#39;m just gonna
show you the sixteen press we started in
another day okay so we&#39;re gonna go down
and pick three random ones okay so
generally I am able to go to all sixteen
and say these are the characteristics is
suitable to be a server they&#39;re suitable
debate on an assembly line are still
would be on the coordinator so the first
one architect INTJ is imaginative and
asteroid and they are strategic thinkers
with a plan for everything what do you
think they are good for that&#39;s a bigger
now what about the console the ESF J
people who are extraordinary Karen they
are socially popular and people who are
always eager to help why should they be
very good server and finally the
Entertainer spontaneous energetic
enthusiastic people and life is never
boring around them generally they will
think of you everywhere
but I will put them on the assembly line
but something like are hard workers that
is doing Chinese burgers out sometimes
it can get a little bit boring
having someone down the team makes it
fun makes work fun
no and you&#39;ve got me thinking a little
bit more now
I played yeah well I don&#39;t play so much
again giving nowadays but I think a lot
when it was still happening right so it
got me thinking okay I believe the MBTI
personality personality has to gaming so
if you look at the defender okay
somewhat varied they&#39;re typically that
decreases and one protectors always
ready to defend the other ones it&#39;s like
mercy from Oh watch right
what about em okay quiet and mystical
yet very inspiring and tireless ideas
they are like the wizard from special
pants right and then we have the
entertainer again spontaneous energetic
enthusiastic
you&#39;re like the barred from attending
the keepers so when we think about RPG
you want to level up we think about
attributes right that the character has
that one attribute so this is one of our
gig working on a griddle lets you go
pick a warrior so yeah I cover that is a
steamer miss in the cheese okay yes the
spatula to scrape the meat patties up
it&#39;s a SWAT and a shield
so if you put RPG characters and put and
identify what attributes each station or
each role does okay you can&#39;t you can
repackage it as something different so
what we&#39;re trying to do here is let&#39;s
say this is not for I&#39;ve not done
anything to end up it this is a game
theoretical so in video games you burn
points and if you see where you want to
put your points that you know if you
have ten points it could find strength
to in dexterity and sort of all so these
are the attributes were looking at
strength intelligence charisma dexterity
Constitution and wisdom this some things
that I think as a human being you want
to have that&#39;s wrong you want to develop
strength you want to Train mental
strength training physical strength
dexterity you only move fast you want to
be able to in businesses won&#39;t be able
to pivot something doesn&#39;t work change
something else right or just in general
being athletically fit in in both wisdom
wisdom from this age the more you
experience the more wisdom you can so I
thought okay take back all the stations
that of the attributes that sir all the
double half-caf that we have put in
place currently the server he needs to
work pass and usually subjective abuse
from the customers the cashier and to be
good if not list and have to be
hospitable assembly line has to be
focused and team player
we don&#39;t want handle that he and
physically P we don&#39;t do multitasking
and fast
prior handle the heat men multitask this
is just a quick example obviously there
are a lot more that they have to go
through if I try to merge this idea and
the attribute idea Komachi
RPG player dexterity plus one
Constitution plus one if you work as a
server right if you work if the cash
they need to be could have numbers
intelligence plus one so I say can I
move forward with this idea and develop
something that allows my part-timers my
staff wanted by what they have learned
to put it into numbers because
I have people that come in and out and
they go they walk up and I&#39;ve seen them
groan see when they come in the nervous
da they don&#39;t know how to speak and when
they go out they are they are
intelligent people they they they are
they have even joined the debate team
and so on I&#39;m parents coming to us
saying hey my son joined you guys he was
shy at first but not so talkative I want
him to stop us we cannot write and we&#39;ve
seen the growth but there is no way to
quantify it and I was thinking what if
we can quantify it now why do I want to
quantify our shy be a little bit later
now what if I build an app that allows
them to track their performance all
right
so Bethel in the kitchen for seven hours
in 0.9 points
travel to another time you know working
another stall or attended a training
class and if you gain experience and if
you can quantify all this and put it in
a nice package whereby they can carry
this and then use the date have
collected about working of us and carry
it into the CV of some sort I feel that
as students you guys experience a lot of
things
you go out there work you go drink
events and whatnot there&#39;s no way that
you can once e1cb still say what you are
president of the man huh so what but if
there was a way to track what you have
learned intelligence this guy because he
was president of the math club is
intelligence is just 100 points right
and when you show your future employee
and say that hey this is something that
I have gained who did not help you
hopefully it does so what I&#39;m trying to
say is I&#39;m hoping to us hopefully
building a platform point app that
allows you to transfer your experiences
in credit for moving forward into your
career I don&#39;t know how far this can go
but I&#39;m gonna try so for now what we&#39;re
gonna do and my program is we&#39;re going
to continue to grow young people we&#39;re
gonna continue to come get them to come
in and contribute and learn and and grow
and then hopefully one day one day
through our little action like this
where we grow
students like you guys into young adults
they are smart they are diplomatic and I
think that my little bit to help in
society so I&#39;m gonna leave you with this
you guys are awesome so go and
[Applause]
