what&#39;s up everybody all right how&#39;s it
going
whoo better yet what is Jew ghetto if
you&#39;re clever you know it&#39;s a play on
the word Geppetto of the legendary story
of a puppet named Pinocchio
I&#39;m originally from Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania real Italy relocated here
all right 13 so years ago I&#39;m from a
small steel mill town about 45 minutes
south of Pittsburgh Claire in
Pennsylvania it&#39;s a steel mill town act
like I could actually smell the
pollution when I came to town with
memory being asleep as a child in a car
and I knew I was almost home because I
can smell it even if my eyes closed this
was the view from my bedroom window in
the housing projects called Blair
Heights this is me and my Sunday&#39;s best
that&#39;s my hometown and where I grew up
so many good memories it was a
tight-knit community life was good we
didn&#39;t have much but I didn&#39;t realize
that I was poor because we always had I
ate every day I remember my mother
saying here take this cup over a miss
Owens house house it had sugar and she
needed sugar or we need to borrow
ketchup someone from someone and we
borrow up there was a barter system we
had our own little small economy and a
neighborhood this is me as an adult
there were a lot of things going on and
the neighborhood I remember when crack
was introduced and I remember as a kid
the mills were open and everyone worked
matter of fact a best friend of mine had
a little clothing
to clothing like a candy store across
the street from the products that I grew
up in and when the meals let out all the
traffic lights was stopped for probably
an hour so while that shift of the mill
let out and if you didn&#39;t make it back
across the street to the projects from
the candy store you were stuck so you
have to sit on the sidewalk and wait for
the traffic to stop then the mill is
closed then the poverty struck in and
then a gang set in and then the violence
but as a young artist we started artists
collective called the British parters
and we started our own creative class
versus the commercial clubs we had
spoken word poetry paintings this is the
shadow lounge I was a live performance
painter at the time and the biggest
compliment ever someone actually stole a
live painting idea from the club so I&#39;m
still winning the walk in someone&#39;s
house and see that painting I&#39;m also a
MC the spoken word artist this is my CD
cover I drew it and my wife did the
graphics for it art kept me out of
trouble I remember even uh one of the
biggest drug dealers in my neighborhood
he pulled up in a brand new 7 series BMW
and he called to check in on he was like
man I&#39;m so proud of my you go to work
every day you know you do your art keep
doing your thing I mean while he has all
this money and all this prestige of
neighborhood but he actually gave me
that respect and that actually planted
his seed in me that this is what I need
to do this was my escape this is a wire
sculpture this is important because this
was the gateway from me doing visual art
and painting to doing three-dimensional
art which led to my puppets I called
this style of wire work 3d scribble I
would take wire and I would wind it and
why did abound it
until it turned into an image and I
started getting more detailed with it
one day it was like mmm maybe if I put
joints one and make one move I could
make a puppet
so my first pub was a really crude wire
sculpture with clothes on nice actually
host open mics with the puppet then I
met this beautiful wonderful man I&#39;m
from Pittsburgh he&#39;s lit his studio was
in Pittsburgh I was doing a live
performance painting at Q Edie&#39;s studios
and actually ran into Fred Rogers he
took me back into his office and we hung
out for like a half-hour talking about
art and all his favorite guests and I
just respect him from the influence he
had over children and he just happened
to be a puppeteer so I was like you know
what I want to do that I want to have
that influence I want to touch lives
through puppets so I started building
purpose when I was in North Carolina
this is strings attached this is my
first rock band I actually put out an EP
David a video on YouTube cause strings
attached called we all puppets started
performing on the streets busking with
the puppets of a builder puppet and I
would go on the streets and practice and
present my work to the public and the
feedback was amazing so I kept doing it
and actually started networking and
meeting people through throwing this
that&#39;s when I met Donna means immerman
of paper hand puppet intervention he
pulled me in and I learned the ins and
outs of the theatre aspect of puppets I
learned a lot from him we built shows
together this is one of our shows called
The Hungry Ghost where I built the body
and he does the large paper mache so we
merged our two styles together and came
up with a different technique and style
of puppets this is my son he was the
biggest fan of the loving robot show
that we did this is actually a cartoon
Maya built for him and we actually had
his fourth birthday party at the paper
house to do with the
Weston this is me at just-right Academy
so private alternative school for kids
with special needs teach kids with
autism and other learning disabilities
behavior whatever we have all this is
mr. skills actually built him to teach a
social thinking curriculum for our kids
with autism in our primary class I have
a funny story this one day a couple kids
shut down they refused to do their work
so I looked at the coke my coworker
there&#39;s the the head teacher in the
class said well what were we going to do
you know we wanted to finish their work
so I actually pulled off the puppet and
you know put the puppet on I had the
puppet speak to the kids like hey no do
you mind finishing this worksheet for me
so they sure skills of course and they
finished their work you know they had
more uh had more respect for the puppet
that he did the teachers which is cool
so you know when last resort I pull off
the puppet so I started developing my
craft got better I use all recycled
materials that&#39;s my niche where I take
materials around the house and I have a
vision in my head and my challenge is to
create something as beautiful as
possible with something leftover a
recycled this is another one that&#39;s made
out of PVC wood and a pair of my son&#39;s
pants this is my artist puppet visual
artists are the spoken word I wrap and I
don&#39;t have time to do those things I
still love them so what I do is I still
do my different art forms through my
puppets and this is actually a painting
that she did
she&#39;s pretty good I got a call one day
you could say I was a rapper and this
guy reppin it with Pittsburgh it wrapped
with in Pittsburgh contacted me and said
yo I got signed I&#39;ve been touring I&#39;m
cool with Missy Elliott she&#39;s once when
she wants puppets for her video and I
was like cool so that happened and I
went to LA to work on her latest video
with Pharrell Williams WTF were they
from this is one of the puppets these
are the fellow puppeteers who worked on
the puppets with us this is me on the
voice they did a performance on her one
of the finales last year so that was
awesome
but all that happened and it was cool it
was exciting but it wasn&#39;t as fulfilling
as working with children and interacting
with everyday common folk so I came home
and I said what can I do with this new
celebrity that I&#39;ve inherited I said I
want to use all my power influence to
educate and keep working with children
because my students at my school
those are my number one fans and this is
why I do it then I met Harris Freeland
Freeland who is the director of black
space it&#39;s a Teen Center who offers free
classes to teach students focus on
inner-city students to do media as far
as a video beats production and music we
merged together and put our ideas
together and I wrote a puppet show
called spin ochio
because I&#39;m Jew ghetto right but it&#39;s a
afro futuristic fame puppet show about
an Android who wants to be a real b-boy
and it&#39;s actually touching on the
subject of police brutality which is
very appropriate at this time this is
the show we did at the initial Museum
and we actually pulled children from
the audience along with my son and
Pierce&#39;s nephew to do a scene where they
came up on stage and it turned into a
dance party these are a few of my
students at the school and I noticed how
they were taken to the purpose I wanted
to do something with that
