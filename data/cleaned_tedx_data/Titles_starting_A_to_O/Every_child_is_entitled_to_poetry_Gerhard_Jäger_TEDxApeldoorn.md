good afternoon all schools should be at
school it&#39;s a slogan from an English
artist is called pop into practice miss
and is one of the passionate people all
around the world to try to get more art
in education why is that important for
the personal goal of children and young
students I&#39;ll give you a few examples
the most important one is of course to
stimulate their own dvt and I have some
them some problems about
the use of the relativity through
politicians and economics it&#39;s mostly
time than use for instrumentalization to
get us a little bit more flexible in the
rat race and sometimes on the economic
side just that they discovered a lost
child again and then the gift management
causes - I&#39;ll give you a few more
examples that helps to say what cannot
be said it helps to discover the whole
spectrum of emotions it shows that
questions have often more than one
answer and the problems have often more
than one solution it encourage critical
thinking and the ability to deal with
ambivalences I remember myself that was
a big thing when I was still young about
sometimes tears not everything clear and
but I wanted to have it clear so
learning about dealing with ambivalences
it offers many ways to see and to
interpret the world it stimulates the
curiosity the power of imagination and
the sense of Wanda etc etc all these
examples have one in common it cannot be
measured and it is something why art is
so problematic about getting in it
school in a more interesting way there&#39;s
a last one I have found out but one more
it gives you some children or their home
in the artist it means if you have
problems in your family you feel not
feel comforted
if problems in your school you see the
artist out there they expressed himself
in a different way and maybe you feel
okay if it&#39;s not there my home if it&#39;s
to tear my home maybe I can find my home
in the art it has to do a little bit
also with me I&#39;m a child
separated child that means I was a lot
at home alone and there was falling in
books and losing myself in the fantasy
of books accident there was also coming
in contact we see other because my
mother had a girlfriend is a florist
it&#39;s the little lady who helps directors
if they are lost in a text and they
needed one time guy who was crossing the
stage and I was quite try but they were
saying it was a bait ok I will do it and
then it was so attractive to me that I
was went between 12 and 16
I played see either I like to go to see
at the school but I was too young
my mother was sending me to be safe too
kind of hotel management school but
after this immediately I started to
place here again for 10 15 years om when
auto-detect amity latent I mean romantic
either least inspired very strong out of
the ideas of the Enlightenment laughs
and the pregnant laugh was holding me to
puzzle because you hear it on my accent
I&#39;m Austrian a little bit Schwarzenegger
accent in Brussels the nice thing
impressed last year a lot of secondhand
book shops did the little baby was
stayin from my own interest but also for
the interest of the little baby I
started in the second hand books to buy
some books always a good idea maybe very
visual books in an outer DTAC tree if
the baby is going maybe he can inspire
himself the 12 books for the little
babies are in the meantime 12,000 and it
was going out a little bit out of my
interests and suddenly more or less
ideas out of the books were starting to
talk and I had more or less the idea out
of the frustration which I experienced
in the past it&#39;s cool about how out
education was done maybe it would be not
so bad to construct kind of a mobile
studio which can fly in sport in Kim
of schools just give children and
youngsters a little bit another
expression and another possibility of
experience art I financed it for four
years on a private level then I had
incredible luck it can only help help
happen in Belgium in Brussels kind of a
surrealistic situation it was a Gavin
there was a government and there was a
culture minister and there was a cabinet
non-political government and they
realized I&#39;m working on the social level
because we worked also for three years
in an immigrant house with immigrant
children work from the artistic level on
the education level so the great that
kind of align and that was the first
time that we get some subvention so it&#39;s
ABC art basics for children is kind of a
nonprofit organization operating on the
borderline of the arts and education and
also a lab for aesthetic experience and
awareness it&#39;s just a basic idea of way
of working I think you cannot construct
magic moments but you can try to create
a prepared environment which increases
the chances that things can happen that
means selecting the best ideas all over
the world for all ages if we construct
Studios prepared environment we do it
for ourselves and not for a child which
is six or twelve or whatever play is the
highest form of research already
Einstein was saying this so we research
and we give this kind of action research
further to public we take a lot of time
if a school bus is coming to us to spend
the whole day we work in small groups
that means around twenty four children
are separated in four little group of
six children we have a lot of respect to
the individuality of them we have kind
of an holistic approach that means out
of cooking is also included and of
course the sinking hand that means a
culture to make experiment and to make
mistakes sometimes which is really
missing at school very very important
our guides which are more or less
assisting on the discoveries of the
children that&#39;s a little bit our showing
the house it&#39;s an workshop week in
Brussels which we transformed and it&#39;s a
little bit few of the
inside why all shoes should be at school
so I&#39;ve won there a lot of answers
passaic if you a very specific one to
balance out the going in equality
between the rich and the poor in our
society and to give equal chances for
the majority and not only for the few
one of the many statistic results just
say you won children and students from
low-income families who take part in art
activities have three times more chances
to finish the school is just one example
the situation for the moment depends on
luck
you all know lack of perast it means if
you&#39;re born in a family with a cultural
background as a child you&#39;re already
quite a step further the next two choice
of the parents about which kind of
school do they have kind of an art
program eg interesting so mostly time
the middle class which are choosing
method schools they have their parents
with a backup in cultural competencies
but I&#39;m more interested not about the
10% which are sending them the good
schools I&#39;m more interested about what&#39;s
about the 90% if you have more or less
always the lack of having an inspiring
supporting teach it would be very
interesting to talk to you about if you
have an experience about it so the right
of a poetic life and the right to come
in an interesting way in contact with
towards it for me a very important thing
so to very complete success ins to make
this happen the first is think about the
education of the teacher it starts
already about the good designed learning
and why I meant why because if you have
it it&#39;s kind of an indirect aesthetic
education now the good she was saying
already the space is a separate teacher
and the material of culture and of
schooling is awesome but so if the
students are basic feeling the becoming
teachers about architecture and interior
design so they and give them the
possibility to participate in kind of a
design process if school is renovating
of a new building is coming up I just
show you one example maybe you will
experience it about Carla architecture
seeing it&#39;s for children we make it
happy
so one more blue red green next one is
the furniture coming in social marketing
it&#39;s for happy children or clean break
blue at whatever next to the toys coming
in again marketing so you come already
in in the home which is an overkill and
Carlos Morales and if the teachers are
not good educated they think also be I
have to show up that they&#39;re good busy
so the glue everything for the Christmas
decoration and the Easter decoration and
all the works of the children absolutely
no feeling about the balance in this
place the second thing is a hidden
curriculum
it means like just try to make this
becoming teachers interesting persons
and this you cannot be an interesting
person just to give a booklet and read
this and then you&#39;re an interesting
person becoming teachers they were never
going out of school they had never
experienced out of any kind of normal
life experience so in the teacher
education I forget them confronted with
interesting people with interesting
experience so they can have something
were to give further to the children
another thing is of course artistic way
of teaching teachers which understand
art as a pedagogic process and the
pedagogic a sadistic process would be
also nice the second suggestion is to
rethink education in general its
magnetic to culture organizations like
musiah&#39;s libraries theaters art and
culture houses they tried oh of course
they did they have a nice to have nice
programs on him
but my question is please try to offer
more and more art education projects for
the public and school children but in
which way they just do it in the way
serving the structures of the schools
which are really not very helpful and
they don&#39;t take the responsibility to
engage themselves in educational reform
debates about the arts in the curriculum
and the general curriculum discussion
there&#39;s a radical vision I was copying
for you you can take it this or you find
in our website on internet a provocative
example of Susan Sontag over saying just
get the kids between 12 and 16 out of
school anyway they are completely mixed
up
and get the people between 50 and 50 for
back-to-school it&#39;s a really really
fantastic thing just please
hate it my solution is the art cart
organization should wake wake up maybe
one exposition less if the money was one
exposition let&#39;s give it to your
Education Department we show them more
respect to give them more freedom to
give them the possibility to work in
better qualities and not only more or
less precooked experience or hiding to
us again so and take aims as example the
famous designer from the 50s Hoover
saying let&#39;s weave the art and the
standard curriculum together and this is
a very very important thing why not by
having in school and art integrated
curriculum that means all subjects you
can use art ideas it does not matter if
it&#39;s mathematics which al-kafi of logic
every where you can use interesting art
ideas and make your teaching in this way
better they becoming teachers have to
learn this at school and there has to be
a curriculum discussion and one more
little cloud on the end about the
importance of art for the personal Co
it&#39;s from Jennifer Williams not only how
can we bring the arts to young people
but also in which way are they already
artists of their own life because sooner
or later we all will have to face a big
confrontation the certainty of death the
finality of our life and we can try to
deal with the situation through religion
so philosophy but also through the art
to learn to die thank you for your
attention
