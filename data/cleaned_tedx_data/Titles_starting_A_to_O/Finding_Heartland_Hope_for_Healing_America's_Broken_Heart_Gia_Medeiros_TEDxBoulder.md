there is a spot in every human heart
it&#39;s known as the SA node this
microscopic cluster of cells that emits
this tiny spark it coordinates all the
activity of your heart when this spot is
misfiring you are a fib d fib means
you&#39;re dead I&#39;m not a cardiologist but a
different kind of heart specialist I
specialize in finding the essence point
in organizations and for 20 years I&#39;ve
seen whole huge systems turnaround
ignited by this simple electrifying
spark I&#39;m here today to talk to you
about one particular essence point that
seems to be troubling all of us the
essence of America itself
my topic cultural climate change and the
hidden politics the heart my question
how might we heal America&#39;s broken heart
you see back in 2005 at 30,000 feet I
had a revelation
I was Criss crossing the country on this
political project and for years I&#39;ve
been hearing how divided we are as a
nation so when this red state rancher
and his white cowboy hat comes to sit
next to me yes so where are you from
I say reluctantly bolder
but for the next two hours we spend our
time bonding about our lives and
Families how he&#39;s worried for his son
that he won&#39;t have the same kind of
opportunities the rancher himself had
when he was young and that makes me
think of this young Latino guy I just
interviewed from bed-stuy he just wants
to find a way to pay for college get a
girlfriend and a good job then I think
about my own daughter at home of tucked
up in her brand-new toddler bed what I
wouldn&#39;t do for her to have a good life
too we all had so much more in common
than our differences you see for
generations the promise of America has
been this better life this better future
for ourselves and for our children but
what happens when that future just feels
broken it breaks our hearts we know we
don&#39;t trust our leaders to fix it down a
hero is coming to save us
so we intuitively know the answer has to
be us what we wonder if there even is an
us Roger stone political operative since
Nixon is fond of saying politics are not
about uniting people it&#39;s about dividing
people and getting to your 51% no wonder
why we want to build a wall around our
hearts standing in the darkness of this
moment you and I together in the space
of I don&#39;t know what to do what if we
allowed our hearts to be broken open
because in my experience that&#39;s exactly
when something new
comes through if our disease is division
then belonging is the cure but how do we
create belonging in such a divided world
the answer is our hearts you see in
America I think we get belonging all
wrong we think it&#39;s about special groups
and special people tribes of teens and
bowling leagues places where we all
agree but is a community based on
agreement really what we need
I believe belonging is about something
else entirely we all need to be part of
something bigger than ourselves our
hearts they know we need each other
you see belonging is part of the fourth
and often forgotten stress response
instead of fight flight or freeze
we tend and befriend connection
unleashes oxytocin nature&#39;s love hormone
it bonds mothers and babies lovers acts
after sex but you can get a hit of
oxytocin just by making eye contact with
a stranger or a friend it draws us
closer together
especially during disasters think about
Houston 9/11 our own Boulder floods
human beings we are the most altruistic
animals on the planet the better part is
belonging doesn&#39;t have to mean agreement
in fact the opposite the social
neurobiology of belonging says that we
feel safest when we can dis
agree and still stay in because in our
evolutionary history out was the most
dangerous place to be this is where I
have to say I&#39;m sorry to my aunt from
New Jersey during this last election I
bludgeoned you with my trumping Clinton
facts I take it back I once heard a KKK
a former KKK members say I never changed
a single belief while ducking a beer
bottle aimed at my head the people who
changed me sat down and became my
friends I want to share one more story
to kind of bed it down and jumpstart our
hearts in 2012 my daughter&#39;s school was
in total leadership meltdown at one
particularly heated meaning I remember
someone screaming when that house is
burning down you yell fire we all know
what happens when you yell fire in a
crowded room at my first board meeting
everyone pointing fingers and spreading
bling I stood up and said are we in this
thing together because it seems to me
it&#39;s gonna take all of us we started
turnaround efforts with community forums
parents teachers students administrators
all coming together and discussing not
just our issues but our hopes and dreams
and visions for the future we discovered
these core tensions that were built
right into our mission tensegrities
is the word for opposing forces that
keep us strong and upright and resilient
into those tensions we found
transformation opportunities our whole
community hearts firing together like
that
microscopic cluster of cells the SA node
in our
hearts today our school is thriving so
so now what what do we do we can&#39;t just
click a button and install our better
world America V 3.0 but we each have the
power to bring us one step closer or one
step farther away this revolution starts
with our hearts our brave hearts willing
to stand in the discomfort of
disagreement feel that heat and instead
of icing and Demming tending and
befriending our curious hearts
courageous compassionate leaning in
diving into those tensions and asking
good questions why is that important to
you what&#39;s your story finding that
tensegrities those opposing forces that
keep us strong upright and resilient our
tender broken open hearts pulsing with
this promise a better life a better
future for ourselves and for our
children author Charles Eisenstein asked
what is that more beautiful world your
heart knows is possible finally just one
last thing we have a bad habit in this
country of leaving when we don&#39;t like
things thanks immigrants and pioneers
explorers Confederates and Californians
and now we&#39;re talking about Mars has
anyone seen the Martian how about we
stay right here and work it out because
isn&#39;t that what community at its heart
is all about
