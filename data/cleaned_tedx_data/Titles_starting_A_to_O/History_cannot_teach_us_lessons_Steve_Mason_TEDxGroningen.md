I didn&#39;t mention the maple syrup ritual
that we go through whenever we meet a
fellow Canadian recently I saw a New
Yorker cartoon picturing a little girl
standing by her parents bedside in the
middle of the night
dad&#39;s fast asleep but mom is bleary-eyed
and the little girl says to her I had a
nightmare
that you and Dad woke up one morning on
the wrong side of history the wrong side
of history we&#39;ve all heard this curious
expression before haven&#39;t we
TV commentators assure us that history
will decide history we&#39;ll pass judgment
on every political career every policy
decision history&#39;s this Authority and
she&#39;s not only watching our moves she&#39;s
bitching to teach us her lessons if only
we could listen but of course we don&#39;t
we&#39;re ignorant and stubborn and so as
the famous saying goes we are doomed to
repeat the past when the Russians invade
Crimea or the Iranian nuclear program
hits the news again some expert will
insist that history teaches us what to
do but Ken history teach us lessons I
don&#39;t think so and I&#39;d like to try to
convince you why that&#39;s the case in fact
I believe that it&#39;s downright dangerous
for our health to expect lessons from
history now to judge from history&#39;s very
own channel on television the Nazis and
Hitler provide the greatest fund of
lessons for all time and we see this in
our political discourse almost every
week someone somewhere is being
accused of appeasement now this word as
you will know attaches to one person in
the past Neville Chamberlain the British
prime minister who with his French
counterpart da la da signed the Munich
Agreement with Hitler and Mussolini in
September 1938 Chamberlain thought we
had achieved peace for our time and he
arrived at the airport waving this piece
of paper well didn&#39;t work out so well
and a year later the devastating war
began although it was Chamberlain who
declared war
he has gone down in tradition as the
embodiment of appeasement right the
biggest lesson of history others you
must never appease ie
talk with negotiate with recalcitrant
States check the internet and you will
see recent politicians from Barack Obama
and David Cameron to even Teresa May
photoshopped into Chamberlain&#39;s 1930s
suit holding the piece of paper why
because in their dealings with Russia
Iran Korea or even in the case of May
with the European Union she didn&#39;t stand
up
she didn&#39;t bare her teeth she tried to
talk to negotiate that&#39;s a lesson of
history the biggest lesson ever is that
you must never appease even the word
sounds creepy doesn&#39;t it nobody wants to
be in a appeaser who would want that
have you ever felt maybe intimidated by
these people who tell us about the
lessons of history so confidently
history teaches us this you know most of
us we don&#39;t remember our school history
that well so we kind of think I don&#39;t
maybe they&#39;re right uh-huh could be I
don&#39;t know I&#39;ve forgotten so let&#39;s do a
little experiment supposing that instead
of feeling guilty about what you don&#39;t
know you got up one morning and you said
to yourself by golly I am going to learn
history&#39;s lessons
where do I go for that sign me up well
you will find out from the people who
talk about history&#39;s lessons they can&#39;t
tell you because those lessons don&#39;t
exist there is no database where we can
look up immigration refugees missile
testing and discovery history lessons
now those people might condescendingly
brush you off and say well go and read
the history books but that&#39;s a scam if
you&#39;ve ever read a history book you know
it doesn&#39;t teach lessons this is not to
say that historians never tried you know
back in the nineteenth and up to the mid
20th century they were really worried
historians were really worried that if
they could not produce lessons if their
research could not generate laws of some
kind they would look like a weak
discipline unscientific what good would
they be so they tried the problem was
people could see right through these
lessons because they could fill they fit
conspicuously well with what the people
already believed so Marxists and
capitalists Christians and atheists
advocates of racial purity and eugenics
all said well hey history obviously
proves our case so that was completely
discredited the best example probably
the last one I know of his 1968 a book
called the lessons of history by will
and Ariel Durant and they&#39;d written this
beautiful 11 volume story of
civilization some of you will know it
detailed history but they seemed to feel
they needed a 100 page statement of the
lessons of all this well what did they
end up with they ended up saying history
is a department of biology and the
fundamental lessons of history are those
of biology competition the survival of
the fittest natural selection ok but
this didn&#39;t come from there 11 volumes
so historians gave up on this kind of
thing now I have a proposal for you
my proposal is the reason that we expect
history to teach lessons is because of
it can
fusion between history and something
else which is tradition what do I mean
by that well tradition is the past on
wheels right the past roaring toward us
imposing itself on us and asking us to
believe it&#39;s lessons every group we
belong to from our family to a
professional military religious
organization we join and above all the
state has its traditions of course the
tradition is what the established
members of the group want newer members
to know and so they take elements of the
past they fashion them together into a
story and they present them to us on a
platter and say this is the meaning of
the past this is not bad it&#39;s part of
life belonging to a group but it&#39;s not
history I would say the tradition that
the problem begins in school because
what we study in school as history is in
fact tradition it&#39;s what the elders want
the young to know about the past right
so all across the world from Japan to
Korea from Israel Palestine through
Germany France to the Texas School Board
these debates go on constantly about
what should we be teaching the young but
when you talk about what shall we pass
along that&#39;s tradition
well what&#39;s history then history is the
opposite
what is the past let&#39;s think about that
for a moment the past of course is
innocent of any lessons the past is just
all this stuff that happened right
much of it horrible some of it Pleasant
most of it forgettable but anyway it&#39;s
all gone so that&#39;s the past I&#39;ve said
that tradition is the past hurtling
toward us lobbying it&#39;s lessons at us
and saying learn this history I would
say is simply the opposite history
originates in us it begins when we have
a question about the past and when our
questions are powerful enough to animate
us to greet to get the skills to go and
investigate for ourselves then we are
in history we are committing history
that&#39;s history history is our
investigation of the past but because it
originates with us it is in us it isn&#39;t
something that can teach us lessons
right it&#39;s something we do okay but am I
not exaggerating to say that it&#39;s
dangerous to think that history teaches
lessons well no I don&#39;t think so first
of all if we think that history is
supposed to teach lessons and we are
ashamed not to know them we make
ourselves vulnerable to those who claim
to know them that&#39;s the first thing
second it can be physically dangerous in
the First World War the nations of
Europe went into the conflict thinking
they had learned the lessons of history
from Napoleon and Clausewitz they had
learned that when you have an enemy you
must bring all your resources to bear
against that enemies center of gravity
to deliver the knockout blow
but they don&#39;t learn the same lessons so
the problem was very soon they&#39;re in
opposed trenches and all they can do is
pile in more soldiers and more weapons
until 18 million people are dead and
there are no winners a much better guide
to action than the supposed lessons of
history is a motto from a recent
American commander-in-chief who like to
say don&#39;t do stupid shit
so if history doesn&#39;t teach lessons what
good is it why does it matter well my
answer to that question is it doesn&#39;t
matter doesn&#39;t matter it does it doesn&#39;t
matter to everyone nothing matters to
everyone it only matters if you care
about the human past but you can live a
happy and prosperous life without
history or theoretical physics or any
number of other things but history has
its attractions first of all it
liberates us primarily from tradition it
allows us to think for ourselves and to
go and investigate and find out what we
think second democracy needs people who
can think for themselves not necessarily
who know a bunch of facts but who know
what evidence is and where to find it
where to seek it how to interpret it how
to criticise the use of others the use
of that evidence by others for dodgy
so-called lessons of history and third
it can bring us huge enrichment in our
lives in our cafe and computer cages in
the 21st century we can imagine only a
fraction of life&#39;s possibilities right
one way to imagine them is to experience
other cultures today of course another
way is to cast our minds back to places
that are very different from our world
to think about different value systems
different frameworks of meaning
different ways of looking at the world
my friends history is obviously the most
fun you can have with your mind but
because it rejects all authority over
the mind it cannot
the one thing it cannot do is teach
lessons
thank you
