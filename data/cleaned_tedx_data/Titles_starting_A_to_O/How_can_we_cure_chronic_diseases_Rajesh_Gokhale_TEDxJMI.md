hello are you let me just just give you
a little bit of Finn I&#39;m not a magician
here or not a person with the
supernatural powers but I&#39;m here to give
you a scientific basis and ideas and
probably ways in which we may be able to
tackle some of the important problems
that are actually of chronic diseases
that lie in this and in fact possibly
cure them if we all get together and
understand how and how we can do this
actually let me just start with you a
personal anecdote just to give you how
difficult this has journey has been and
how how complicated it is actually
there&#39;s something that I haven&#39;t shared
with people yet ever in my life and is
the first time but all of you would
recollect actually and this Sarris many
of your students but all of you you know
just fantasize maybe because many of
your students here off you know the day
when your loved ones would come and you
know say to you will you marry me and I
recollect that date actually when when
this happened with me on a wonderful
romantic evening hands in hand oblivious
of the world then we got this word
across to my wife and you know and we
know and we acknowledge will you marry
me and I said yes and she said yes and
that was something fantastic but then
she immediately reported back and said
but do you know that I have vitiligo and
vitiligo some of you would recollect is
in fact a disease
[Applause]
[Music]
you can see the one on your left in fact
open if you think you can solve the
disease tonight one on your left
actually if you can raise your hand back
then they will think the season on your
left are in fact solvable and many of
you would think they are in fact the
population differences in the two
diseases can be easily segregated
independent evil people on one who are a
small curve which shows that these
people don&#39;t have the disease and on the
left one the one that you have that you
are normal people you don&#39;t have the
infections so many of these infected
disease people in fact you can
rationalize and divide them into two
populations and what antibiotics does
which has revolutionized the world is
what it does is in fact
treats people who have infected one and
brings them to a normal kind of normal
class of people actually and that makes
this really interesting because it&#39;s
easier to be able to do this then be
able to carry out the process actually
and it&#39;s because of this history of
antibiotics that one is able to do this
if you ask a question with regard to
chronic diseases unfortunately the story
is very different because the chronic
disease is in fact a disease within your
own body it&#39;s about your own system and
it&#39;s about your own self that what is
happening to you and how does it rather
than in fact an exterior person doing it
and in fact since this is what most of
the science that happened for last for
the infectious diseases all of our
clinical research unfortunately even
today demands that there should be two
population of people if you want to
develop clinical research where one in
fact tries to cure and the other which
is a normal human being actually in fact
that&#39;s not the case if you look at the
human by itself physiology can be
described as a continuum of variety of
states it&#39;s not a single state of our
body what I showed you then two
different curves were cross population
in fact this is if within the same
person itself and you can see this red
disc that&#39;s moving around is moving
around between the regions that are blue
and the orange the region of the blue in
fact corresponds to what you would like
to call yourself as a healthy zone this
is zone where you know you can you can
have all physiological parameters going
on well the region on the red in fact
the region that actually is a partly
disallowed and I like to call it as a
metastable region just to give an
example of what is this metastable
region of your body is you can say that
your BP is normal when you are in the
veneer in the Blue Zone but if I start
running your BP in fact starts to
increase and many of your parameters of
heart rate and in fact they all sort of
so in fact they all now move into a
space that you would like to call a mat
a stable region of the body now as the
moment you stop running within no point
of time the red disc in
comes back and stays within your the
blue zone
and since this blue zone then defines
the steady state of your body and a
healthy state of your body in fact to
carry out and similarly the body is very
very beautiful in terms of adapting all
these things and that&#39;s why if you have
a rich fatty food you can in fact use up
certain pathways that are away from this
or you can use or if you you take very
high sugar diet you will have in fact a
different part of the zone that he would
look at but at all given point of time
you want to come back into the Blue Zone
of your body which is actually a stable
state and a good health of your body the
longer you stay in the metastable stage
the longer the propensity that your body
is in fact going to go and turn out into
an areas where you&#39;re in fact going to
cause diseases to yourself and create
some of the problems that are going to
be that are going to be talking about it
and that is that the chronic word in
fact means sustained period of effects
that lies in the region of metastable
regions which then due to an altered
altered pathways or an altered infection
spiral down into a form that is called
diseases now what is the use of this
then these states of our body how can we
make use of them in fact how can in fact
make better life out of it now there are
two important parameters that one needs
to understand in a common man&#39;s language
actually one is what you would like to
define the elasticity of your body
actually of your functions of your body
you want to know how long and how long
can I stay in a metastable state you
have to come back to the normal state
because if you stay longer and longer
and metastable state you want to come
back to this state and in fact many of
these are determined by our genetics of
our body what we have what are we made
up of what we have got that way you can
see that some people are very happy
eating fatty food and they in fact don&#39;t
get any problems that some people in
fact have problems taking the fatty food
in fact are not able to actually sustain
their life very well on the same effects
that&#39;s a genetic part of your system
but in fact the genes while they
determine these transitions how these
transitions you can move around in a way
that makes your body far more healthier
and interesting is in fact you can
define it&#39;s not defined only by the
genes that are present in them and
therefore it&#39;s the elastic limit what I
call off your sustainance power
determines whether your body will switch
stand pressures or stresses or a variety
of problems that can then finally boil
down to the disease problem so how do we
look at this and and very simplistically
the human body in fact can be
represented by a diagram that in fact is
very very critical to maintenance our
system the first one that I already
talked to you about is the elasticity
limit is the limit by which every
function in your body can be stretched
but in fact brought back to the normalcy
you can have a very heightened BP level
you can have a heightened heart rate you
can in fact eat only sugars for very
long periods of time and then come back
to the normal part of the life you can
look at the second and the most
important part in fact which is becoming
very very significant is the energy
management of your cells of every aspect
of the work that you in fact carry out
how are you going to utilize this energy
that is going in and the energy that is
going out in fact to carry the function
of everything that you do starting from
respiration which requires your energy
or for a or for your bri or if your
heart muscles to work or your body
muscles to work and therefore it&#39;s the
balance of all these that determines is
this and humans in fact have evolved by
actually cross talking between two
important components of how much
elasticity you need if you eat raw food
how will you survive if you eat this
other kind of food how will you look at
it and the problem then interestingly
during evolution another important thing
occurred that is how do we protect
ourselves and the way you protect us
yourself is in fact by do using immune
responses that are again inner unto your
body so how am I going to protect if I
have
certain foreign thing coming in or in
fact in a way that I&#39;m going to be
actually having an issue in some part
the body now these three together forms
a very very integral part of our body
system and therefore are really the
basis of what kind of diseases and how
these diseases in fact will perpetuate
and carry out the process the
inflammation that I wrote to get it down
is in fact an outcome of a combination
of all these things in sin incidentally
the inflammation is an important aspect
of resolution of any disease that you
have in the context of chronic diseases
or even for infectious diseases but it&#39;s
the balance of this in fake inflammation
is what one needs to calibrate and one
needs to understand and in fact what
many of the many of the other
technologies or techniques that we use
to improve our body system which is
either got to do with say yoga or got to
do with you know variety of other
purposes is in fact is improving the
elastic limit or your ability to in fact
get immune system to work better and
better so all of these in fact functions
to get and improve your parameters that
makes all of them very very important
and interesting so how do we then
proceed further actually the real
challenge comes is the disease problem
actually the problem is many of these
diseases is in fact are not looked at in
a temporal manner they in fact are
looked at as a static diseases
incidentally these diseases can be
broadly classified into four different
forms there&#39;s an onset of a disease
there is a disease that is very rare
disease tries to put together things and
then you reach an equilibrium pace I can
give you an example for example diabetes
which is a disease of high sugar in fact
is it&#39;s die is an equilibrium state of
your disease the insulin which is
produced in your body is in fact never
had a chance to go back and metabolize
and bring the levels down so typically
all all the diagnosis right now for the
chronic diseases happens in an
equilibrium phase of the problem and
this equilibrium phase is not the most
useful phase in fact because it&#39;s only
telling you the symptoms and
not telling you the cause and the real
challenge in disease biology is lies at
the bottom of what is the cause of a
disease and that&#39;s the point that I&#39;m
trying to come to you to all of you to
talk about it but in fact the challenge
is to understand the causes and not the
door and not the reasons of why what the
disease is about it&#39;s not about having
high blood pressure it&#39;s about why that
high blood pressure has come it&#39;s not
about having high glucose it&#39;s about
understanding how to get to do that and
what you can understand and a rather
difficult problem of chronic diseases is
in fact the last part which is a period
of uncertainty that I measure now what
happens in this is that because of the
long periods of survival of these
chronic diseases in fact we have tissue
where the all these activities are
happening undergoes what is called
remodeling this is an example of a
disease that I talked to you about
vitiligo in the beginning done in our
lab it&#39;s from a patient sample we&#39;ll
take a normal normal skin and take the
skin that is different from it and you
can very clearly make out it&#39;s from the
same human being but you can see how
different they are one of them is a
diseased skin one of the non diseased
skin now what is the problem then
disease skin the problem with the
disease skin is there is a structural
fault
right now the disease in the skin in
fact is no longer what a normal skin
should look like and therefore the cells
that are supposed to function normally
cannot in fact function and the chronic
disease is the last period of chronic
disease in fact is to do with the fact
this
[Applause]
we actually look like the process of
disease and not just the disease is a
one time point event you need to
actually in fact look at ways of how I
define your own metabolism and that&#39;s
why the Family Physicians is a very
important aspect because it&#39;s within
your genes and therefore you get to know
how you can look at it you can just
treat not trees the causes but you need
to look at symptoms symptoms are the key
to your disease maintenance of all
chronic diseases and the in fact can be
found within your nutrition within your
food within your environment within what
you do on a daily basis and therefore
you can treat them on your own the jeans
are the destiny and the triggers are
elsewhere please remember it&#39;s not just
about your genes the triggers have to be
tackled and in different way
incidentally many triggers can&#39;t can&#39;t
can cause the same disease and the
disease like vitiligo which continue to
change in your life we can show that
many times the new patches that appear
is in fact four different causes and
therefore you can stall them because
they are all part of your lifestyle and
they&#39;re all part of what you do actually
and eventually if you cannot resolve
these the problem is how do I recover
the tissue back how do I bring back the
life to the tissue that is dead for
example in the diabetes I want to
improve the pancreas in the case of
disease like Whittle I go I want to
improve the skin and that&#39;s the way to
manage and in fact carry out the process
so the point is because 20% the
population of India is down that chronic
diseases its onus is on us you&#39;re not
going to have medicine doctors only
solving the problems the problem has to
be solved within ourself in a way that
defines simplistic soul
Lucian&#39;s trajectories of path unable to
in fact carry out and give us ways to
look at it I think I&#39;ll stop here thank
you
[Applause]
