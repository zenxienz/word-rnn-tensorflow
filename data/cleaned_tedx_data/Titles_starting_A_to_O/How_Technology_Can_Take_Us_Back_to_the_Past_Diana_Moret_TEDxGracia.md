how many of you have spent time as a
child in a rural village raise your hand
in a village in a rural village when you
were quite a lot of people this is me
and my family need from my father&#39;s
village as many of you we used to spend
our holidays there have you ever thought
that we might be the last generations
having parents that belong to a village
this is the old MacKinnon sir my
father&#39;s billets around the 60s a
Dumba&#39;s was built about the riverside
and by then inhabitants of McKean Anza
were forced to move to a new billet then
were given two choices having a new
house in the new industry lies at
McKinnon Sun or getting money and having
a flat in a city nearby my father&#39;s
family took the second choice but they
would never settle down in Barcelona at
least emotionally this is the Olmec
Bonanza today the village the old
village was never sunk because of the
dam but it was fully demolished in the
last few years today I&#39;m gonna explain a
story of return return to our past to
our villages
yes right now when technology and
artificial intelligence are threatening
the human race today I&#39;m going to
explain how and why I think technology
can actually save all villages such as
MacKinnon Sun from vanishing forever
what happened to my father&#39;s family
wasn&#39;t a nice
thing there are more than 3000 abandoned
villages in Spain and rural the
population it&#39;s now affecting 4,000
villages this is also happening in Italy
where there&#39;s 20,000 ghost villages and
you may be thinking out this just
happened in Italy in Spain because you
know dictatorship so on no way in China
there are nearly 1 million go spiritus
and five thousand in Japan and where is
everybody
still going I mean where guess well yes
we are still filling up in big cities
and most technologies I really enforcing
unknown control at gentrification
process
who knows what gentrification means so
Rajendra fication to simplify it is the
rise at interest towards an a specific
location the good things objectification
our business development and the
attraction of new and new entrepreneurs
to that area but we thought control
gentrification leads to real estate
speculation and the foresaid migration
of locals does this ring a bell
barcelona property owners are literally
kicking out from their homes long term
Drennen tenants and instead of this they
are hosting short term vacation base
guests every day is more difficult to
reside in the cities most of us work and
live so maybe the question more than
where is why why are we still filling up
in cities especially why when nature
doesn&#39;t just makes us happier and
healthier but also smarter as science
confirms several universities in the USA
have proven with groups of people
spending four days in nature that they
have increased by 50% they problem solve
them problem solve em and creativity
capabilities so this is a fact nature
and thus rural areas enables
productivity creativity focus high
performance and moment of flow this is
because our lateral thinking and
leverage capabilities are reinforced set
out there so this means that you get
much more things done in few days in
nature that in one full month in your
office sure that&#39;s why more scientific
breakthroughs happened out in nature
every day there are more companies and
individuals myself that are using nature
as a vehicle for reconnecting with
ourselves but also for boosting boosting
businesses scientists are still filling
out why nature works so well for us but
I think the answer is simpler at the end
we come from nature our parents as said
before grandparents grew up in small
communities in villages surrounded by
nature nature was for most of us home
some time ago and if you think of it
nature is us and also why should we go
on working and living in cities mostly
now that we can work from whatever
there&#39;s good internet connection mostly
now as well when we are quitting more
than ever our jobs reinventing ourselves
professionally starting up new
businesses failing and rising up again
did you know that 90% of productive
people worldwide is not happy with their
job did you know it some of us are
already working living and working in
the remote area this means that we mix
work and
and life and laser and we often do so in
beautiful places natural locations and
rural areas I mean don&#39;t get me wrong
I&#39;m not envisioning a horde of aliens
invading villages with their laptops a
bunch of very interesting people and
entrepreneurs are already abandoning
cities yes
abandoning cities and going back to
their home villages relocating their
businesses starting up new projects
visit on the local economy or opening up
co-working spaces shared offices that at
the same time are attracting other young
professionals to the villages knowing it
or not knowing it what those are doing
those entrepreneurs are mixing tradition
and technology for revitalizing their
rural hometowns you may be thinking is
this a new tepee well no it&#39;s not just
to name a few of them in the other side
of the wall Steve and his team has been
managing from the last seven years one
of the top ten co-working spaces by
forests they have inspired very
international professional community in
the middle of the island of Valley in a
rural village and the river side the
river the seaside story is not nearby
near from here in Tarragona river is a
river on a very pioneer and young
government launched it one of the very
first co-working spaces with fiber optic
internet enable it&#39;s nearly six years
ago and in the north of Catalonia in
Girona excell al we&#39;re in a group of
thriving entrepreneurs and young
families that&#39;s growing over time have
chosen La Scala in villages around for
living and growing their businesses they
are about to launch a co-working space
that would gather creative professionals
and makers from the area and from cities
nearby at this point
I would be asking myself how can we take
part of this rural connected return what
if we start by those nearly 1 million
empty houses that there are in rural
areas in Spain some of those empty
houses are located in very convenient
bilities not just beautiful but also
accessible with fiber optic internet
business incubators co-working spaces
kindergarten primary school powder
courts swimming pools and so on but most
of all some of those empty houses are
located in villages that have already
been chosen by some of those interesting
intrapreneurs I told you about before
light Excel or our wealth so while
waiting for holiday or weekend to go to
the village imagine that you can keep on
living in inner city in Barcelona but
you can combine your time there with
periods of time with family or team in
one of those entrepreneurial villages
imagine that you don&#39;t want to move to a
village forever but you want to try out
this rural connected thing to see how it
feels
let&#39;s say you feel somehow attracted by
the idea of having a second house in
abilities but you don&#39;t want to commit
to anything permanent and most of all
you don&#39;t want to have to pay for the
second mortgage you might not even be
paying for the first one so let&#39;s take
for instance one all house in the
village of River Raja Libre it is a very
authentic and beautiful village house of
course it needs some renovation costs
instead of yourself acquiring the house
let&#39;s keep its ownership in its current
owners hands just in case you change
your mind so instead of buying this
house and renovating it by own for a
considerable considerable amount of
money you could share the renovation
costs with other Co users three Co users
let&#39;s say
and by these and by covering this
content yearly access fee you and those
four users would be able to enjoy this
fully renovated authentic village house
in River Raja all right but let&#39;s say
you don&#39;t want having to choose because
you even know the place and you are not
really sure but most of all we like to
move up to move around Tom wait so as a
canoe sir of this house in River Raja
Devlin you could become the co user of a
multi property system for village houses
this means you would just you wouldn&#39;t
just have access to this village house
in River Raja but to as many business
houses as others have contributed to
renovate in a number of villages that
would be growing growing and growing
over time it turns out that is precisely
a distributed transparent and copper
attic technology that can make this
possible a technology that would enable
a housing system that would prioritize
the use versus the ownership of those
properties this means instead of
managing the ownership of the properties
this technology would simply distribute
the right to access these empty houses
in a non speculative way the goal of
this technology would be filling up
empty village houses throughout the year
allowing its users to collaboratively
renovate them reveal them and inherit
them making someday possible to
collaboratively rebuild
fully ruined and abandoned villages by
its new co-inhabitants this technology
would actually in
our return to Bilitis our return to pass
for regaining our freedom of movement
for doing more of what we like how we
like it but most of all where we like to
do it and all these while contributing
to a good cause
reviving our abilities for a better
living this is a dream some of us are
already living in would you join us
