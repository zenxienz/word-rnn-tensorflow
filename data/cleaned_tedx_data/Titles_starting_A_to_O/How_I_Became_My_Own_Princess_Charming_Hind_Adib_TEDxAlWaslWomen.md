you
hi so instead of introducing myself
first I kind of want to get to know you
guys a little bit better so I want to
ask you to raise your hand if you&#39;ve
ever felt broken lost confused
disappointed and alone Wow now raise
your hand again if you felt all of these
things but pretended like everything was
perfect wow I guess I&#39;m not the only one
day
my journey started nine years ago when I
started fashion school and for my
graduation I needed to create a
collection a clothing collection of nine
items for it to walk down a huge runway
that day was probably the best day of my
life it was so exciting seeing my
clothes on the runway and seeing
people&#39;s reactions to it it was so
exciting and I knew this was what I
wanted to do for the rest of my life so
there was me 21 year old girl that&#39;s me
in the middle by the way hoping that by
26 I would probably have my own store
because that&#39;s my dream and maybe have a
family because that&#39;s what the society
expects from a woman at 26 right I had
my whole life planned out but little did
I know that life had other plans for me
a year after this day on mm tall I hit
complete rock-bottom and I knew that on
that day I was my life was either going
to end or completely start over now let
me rewind back to graduation
after I graduated I found myself
completely confused not sure what to do
with my life
I don&#39;t know where to start I was
unemployed I was really just I lost all
hope with my dreams and along with that
I was very close to somebody who was
very emotionally abusive and
if anybody knows about abusive
relationships emotional abusive
relationship with a family member or a
friend or a spouse you&#39;d know how
devastating it is to feel like you&#39;re
not important and that your dreams are
not important
it&#39;s truly heartbreaking to feel like
you don&#39;t matter and by the person you
care about that you&#39;re worthless you
start to believe that you are and I know
that emotional abuse doesn&#39;t leave
bruises on your body but it definitely
read leaves bruises on your heart
and your confidence along with that I
had a lot of health problems as well I
was suffering with my thyroid it was not
functioning very well I was always tired
and exhausted and in pain and all I
wanted to do was just stay in bed all
day and sleep so we hit rock bottom that
day I realized that you know one was
gonna save me and if I wanted a happy
and healthy life it was my
responsibility to get it I need to I
need it to be my own princess charming
so that&#39;s exactly what I did and along
with all the things I lost like
self-confidence my sense of worth my
love for my life and my joy for life I
also lost the fear the fear of losing
and the fear of failure so I had nothing
left to lose and I went all-in and with
the support of my amazing family and
close friends I cut all ties with that
music person and I started to take my
life in my health seriously and I
decided that I was gonna flip my life
upside down it was kind of like having
to draw my life from scratch how
exciting it would be if you had it clean
cannabis to draw whatever you want on it
now it&#39;s my life at that point so I
decided that I needed to flip my mindset
it&#39;s first and foremost 180 degrees I
needed to
think about things positively rather
than negatively and from the smallest
situations like you know being stuck in
traffic instead of feeling angry and
upset and annoying I would tell myself
you know what maybe the universe is
saving me from something that would have
happened if I&#39;m not stuck in this
traffic this is a tiny example but it
has to start small I also had to tell
myself that I needed to say yes to
opportunities I needed to get out of my
comfort zone and I needed to experience
life again because at that point I was
at zero so I started saying yes to new
opportunities and new feelings and
meeting new people and as an introvert
that it&#39;s really hard for me to do but I
had to get out there and experience
lives kind of like how I&#39;m doing right
now speaking to more than three people
at a time so I did that and the first
thing I said yes to was a job as a
photographer&#39;s assistant and what I had
to do all day long was to dress and
undress a mannequin for photoshoots that
was it I was just dressing I&#39;m just
saying all day that&#39;s not what I
expected to have my life you know I&#39;m
doing at that time but with my new
attitude I gave it all of my energy and
gave it all my efforts and it felt
really good feeling productive and doing
something and soon after I started
getting more tasks from that same job
things like product photography fashion
photography videos doing graphic design
and I said yes and let me tell you a
secret
I had no idea how to do any
but I would write I would run home
everyday and teach myself everything I
needed to know to get the job done and
it worked and I did a good job and I
felt so exciting being a part of an
amazing team and being recognized for my
work stuff that I never knew before it
was all my effort that I put into myself
and it made an effort like it made a
difference and it felt so good I also
met a lot of amazing people that truly
shaped my the person that I am today
they taught me about compassion and
supporting and being understanding I I
learned so much about people and the
fashion world in these two years these
two years were the most enlightening
years of my life because I I just said
yes to all these feelings and things
that I&#39;ve forgotten how to feel like
excitement and joy and it was awesome to
get it all back so after that I realized
there was a huge gap between the perfect
and shiny world of fashion and people&#39;s
true feelings and emotions you know
there&#39;s a huge gap there&#39;s I can&#39;t even
explain it so I decided that I really
wanted to build a bridge to connect it
to a bridge that would allow people to
express themselves and their experiences
through their clothing so this time I
had to dig deep into my own world so
this time I said he asked to discovering
my own feelings and other people&#39;s
feelings I said yes to my flaws to my
fears to my dreams I said yes to
connecting and feeling and being real
and raw and honest I basically said yes
to imperfections so that&#39;s when I quit
my job and started working on my own
brand and ironically my brand&#39;s logo is
an X so no because there is also a
beauty of the connection between the
words yes and no
because when you say no to the world&#39;s
negativity you say yes to your own
personal growth and that&#39;s really
important to learn when to say no I felt
so much power and saying no to judgments
to to perfection and to negativity
whether that comes from within with
self-doubt and and fears and whether it
comes from others so I really wanted to
share how I felt with the world I wanted
people to feel empowered and strong and
independent and so I decided to make a
collection and to be honest I was
terrified that no one would be
interested I thought who would be
interested in like sharing their
emotions on their field on their clothes
like why but I I did it anyways and I
was stunned as the result I was getting
emails and emails about people having
struggles and how they overcame them and
how when they saw the collection they
felt so much connection to it and it
looks so happy I was like shaking from
how crazy it just all is I didn&#39;t expect
it to be like that when women told a
story about how she was battling
depression and how she went through a
lot of struggles with her life and then
how she overcame them by taking care of
herself and forcing herself to get out
there and and be a better person and she
is in a good place now obviously she
keeps you know like struggles are always
happening in our lives but it&#39;s always
good to be strong and like you know face
those fears so when she saw this piece
of my collection
she felt like she really connected to it
she felt like a true fighter and she
really wanted to wear that and tell her
story in a way without even saying words
another woman told the story about how
she gave birth to her baby by herself in
her living room
nobody was there in seven minutes she
gave birth and she even caught her only
I&#39;m gonna kill cords and everything it&#39;s
crazy isn&#39;t it
and when she saw this jacket she was
like yes I have got my own back and I
really she really wanted the world to
know that she wanted to express how
she&#39;s so strong and she does have her
own back and she doesn&#39;t need anybody to
to help her to do whatever and the best
story of all not the best I mean they&#39;re
all the best but the most touching one
of all is from my very close friends who
was going through a really bad divorce
and she was struggling with the
society&#39;s judgments obviously you know
how stigma around you know divorce and
how single women are gonna live their
lives after divorce and when she she
actually bought the jacket while she was
going through this process and after a
few months she she told me how much
confidence it gave her it was this
jacket as well she was like I felt so
confidence until confidence and telling
people that I have my own back I don&#39;t
need a man to be happy she felt so much
power over that jacket and it made me so
happy knowing that this piece of
clothing gave her so much power and
confidence that meant the world to me
and that is when I realized that we&#39;re
all humans and we all want to connect in
some way whether it&#39;s ourselves to our
you know to other people and to my
discovery to their clothes as well yeah
that was a crazy journey with with this
you know with this launch and we just
celebrated a one-year anniversary for
this
[Applause]
so yeah I am forever grateful for the
hardships that came along the way and
all the others that keep that will keep
coming my way
and because without them I would have
never lost myself and saw the world in
such a dark way and therefore I would
have never really appreciated the people
I have in my life as much as they do now
and I would have never looked to the
world so brightly as much as I do now
and if I had to give my 21 year old self
any advice would be one to say yes
imperfections your life is not going to
go according to your plan ever so let go
of your plan and let life take you to
unexpected places it&#39;s so much fun that
way trust me the second thing I would
say is be compassionate with others you
never know what anyone&#39;s going through
and we are all going through struggles
and battles and all we need is a space
to feel comfortable enough to be
ourselves and to connect with others
actually a little story about that I was
sitting in a park in Europe one day and
a man came up to me and he had a dirty
beard and holes in his clothes and in
society&#39;s eyes would be called homeless
he probably was but regardless I I
listened and to my surprise that was one
of the most beautiful connections I&#39;ve
had with a stranger my whole life so I
realized that we&#39;re all we all have the
same heart you know we we all want to
connect to all want to feel we all want
to be compassionate to each other it&#39;s
just these exterior things that are
blocking us from connecting things like
you know what you&#39;re wearing how you
look like
are you acceptable in society or not and
that is really heartbreaking so that is
what I would say to myself be
compassionate and open to everybody
don&#39;t judge people according to how
they look and how they see me the third
thing I would say is your success is not
measured by what the society expects
from you you don&#39;t need to be anywhere
at a certain age you define your success
you define your life the way you want
and the last thing I would say is say
yes to opportunities don&#39;t worry about
not knowing enough you&#39;ll never know
enough you just learn along the way just
do it to start and I hope you all got
there today looking at the world and
yourselves and others in the new light
and I hope that you know that you too
have got your own back
[Applause]
