you know what life can be strange
sometimes when you take a simple idea
and you do it on a large scale it can
take on a life of its own and you never
know where it can go have you ever taken
part in a workplace secret Center
how about organizing a secret Center
game and then later on you get
interviewed by ABC News New York on the
phone mentioned on the Huffington Post
The Guardian and many other worldwide
sites like Nigeria Daily News
well that&#39;s happened to me the basic
concept of a secret Center game you&#39;re
given someone&#39;s name randomly and you
buy that person a gift usually for a set
dollar amount and most people never
reveal who they were Secret Santa for
this can lead to some very funny gifts
in great workplace stories and the
amazing thing is so when you take this
small fun idea and you decide to spread
it as far as you can you can never be
truly prepared for the impact that this
can have on other people back in 2010 I
was having a conversation on Twitter and
the topic of Secret Santas had come up
we both agreed there were a very cool
activity to take part in and I began to
wonder what would it be like if you did
it on a larger scale and how would it
work
if you did it on Twitter so I thought
about it and the next day I started
asking people would you like to take
part in the Secret Santa game lots of
people said yes and New Zealand Secret
Santa was born let me ask you how often
has the fear of the unknown stopped you
from starting a project the fear of
failing putting it into your idea before
it&#39;s even started
now I wasn&#39;t a hundred percent sure how
any of this was really going to work but
I knew that I wanted to do it and I knew
that lots of people were going to have
fun taking part luckily for me through
the power of Twitter
I got messaged by someone who was an
expert with spreadsheets they sent me a
spreadsheet that helped randomly match
people up and help generate all the
messages I had to send out to the secret
centers people were given the Twitter
name and address of their gift D and it
was up to them to research that person
by reading their tweets and sending them
an appropriate gift well that was the
plan in theory and they were also
encouraged to share a photo of the gift
that they received to share the fun and
excitement with everybody else three
hundred and eighty six people signed up
in that first year people were sending
gifts all around the country and the
feedback that I was getting was really
positive but sometimes there were bad
centers now bad centers for whatever
reason didn&#39;t send a gift and I was
still hearing about those bad centers in
January February and March of the
following year leading up to the second
year of New Zealand Secret Center I was
approached by a nationwide radio station
asking if they could run it I thought it
was only fair to ask the community what
they thought so I went on Twitter and I
let everybody know what the proposition
was the resounding answer from everybody
was no the community had spoken so I
carried on the New Zealand Secret Center
and let me introduce you to the team
there&#39;s me while lots of people thought
there was a big team behind this in
reality it was just me and in that
second year I decided to build a website
to help manage all the people that were
signing up
there was a lot better than handling
hundreds of Twitter dm&#39;s all at once and
696 people signed up in that second year
people were sending gifts all around the
country and I was getting all the
messages coming towards me of people
excitedly talking about it I kept
matching people up and I learned from
some people this was the only gift they
were going to receive at Christmas I
said the limit for gifts at ten dollars
and some people went above and beyond
this both an effort and value from
custom-made mix CDs tickets to the Rugby
League handmade custom calendars
accommodation and fancy hotels to puck
earrings a stuffed toy shark gifts for
pets and many mugs this is just a small
selection of the great gifts being sent
all around the country and one of the
most heartfelt gifts had to have been a
pair of soldered angel wings on a plaque
the secret Center had read every post
and there gifties blog and had learned
that his father had passed away before
being able to make this plaque for his
granddaughter this is a really good
example of strong emotional connection
happening through social media and the
reaction to a gift like that was my New
Zealand Secret Santa gift is so perfect
I&#39;m crying for those who might not know
why read this and he linked to the blog
post where he talked about his dad&#39;s
sudden death heartfelt gifts like this
were not uncommon and seeing people&#39;s
reactions to this is priceless it&#39;s one
of the driving forces behind New Zealand
secret Center 860 people took part in
the third year my phone was still going
crazy with all the messages hitting my
way and when it was time to match
everybody up
I was having to take time
off work just to deal with sending out
all the messages and dealing with all
the questions coming back towards me and
after that third year I began to wonder
did I still want to be doing this
it was almost getting too big for me to
handle by myself and I was wanting to
spend more time on my other passion
growing giant pumpkins so I went on
Twitter and I asked is there anybody out
there that would like to run this now
I wasn&#39;t sure who would be a good fit
for this but I knew that I didn&#39;t want
just anybody coming in trying to
monetize it and ruin it I wanted someone
that had the same belief as myself and
wanted to keep running it to bring
happiness to other people I got a
Twitter DM from New Zealand post saying
that they may be interested but first
they had to go talk to their management
team and see if they were allowed to do
it while they were doing that I was
talking to people that I trusted and
asking them what they thought about that
idea all the feedback I got was really
positive and New Zealand Post came back
and said they were keen airs they were
already doing the letters to Santa every
year for the kids and they said this
would be a great fit so after that we
got together and had a conference call
and I talked about how I was running
everything behind the scenes and ever
since then
New Zealand Post has been running New
Zealand secret centre and New Zealand
Post has been a great fit they&#39;ve been
able to bring a lot of innovations to
the game that I started all those years
ago firstly all the gifts are sent to
one central location no one has to share
their address with anybody else and
secondly all the gifts are scanned when
they&#39;re received at the warehouse
if you&#39;ve been a bad Center you&#39;re not
going to be getting sent a gift and what
they&#39;ve done is they&#39;ve got partnerships
with businesses to make sure that all
the people that did end up with the bad
Center still get sent something at
Christmas over the years they&#39;ve
partnered with some great charities like
the Wellington City Mission the
Christchurch earthquake appeal the Red
Cross and more recently canteen so all
the gifts that would normally go to a
bad centre now go to these great
charities the fun and excitement carry
on every year and last year just shy of
2,000 people took part New Zealand&#39;s
Secret Santa got lots of global media
interest with lots of bad things
happening all around the world the media
really liked the story of New Zealand
secret center and it made New Zealand
the place to be at Christmas time what
project do you have that you haven&#39;t
started what&#39;s holding you back and why
don&#39;t you give it a nudge and see where
you can take it because at the end of
the day what&#39;s the worst thing that
could happen
