I spent most of my time in the world of
technology and human DNA and we&#39;re about
to embark an incredible journey a very
tough journey where we&#39;re gonna make
decisions about the future of our
species about life not only in this
planet but probably the next planet in
our lifetime and often I ask myself how
do I prepare myself for some of the
decisions that we&#39;re gonna have to make
and I don&#39;t know so the journey that I
want to take you on today actually
starts here this is the Mayan jungle in
the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and
about two hours south of Cancun around
the town of Tulum the Mayan jungle looks
like this you have this dirt roads and
you go into the jungle and there was
this beautiful trees and plants and
crazy insects that you&#39;ve never seen
before
and every once in a while you find
something like this and this is the same
not day so note that there&#39;s a hole of
water in the middle of the jungle and
these holes of water and they&#39;re more
than a hundred of these in the Yucatan
Peninsula were created about 65 million
years ago and over millions of years
water filtered into them the Mayans
thought these places were sacred and
they thought of them as the door to the
underworld and that&#39;s where I want to
take you today now before we go there I
need to prepare you the same way that I
prepare myself every time I go there so
in a minute I&#39;m gonna ask you to close
your eyes and do a little breathing
exercise and I know what you&#39;re thinking
like oh boy here we go
no it&#39;s gonna be short and easy I&#39;m
gonna show you first what we&#39;re gonna do
and then I&#39;m gonna ask you to close your
eyes and do this with me we&#39;re going to
put our hands in our stomach just like
this not yet just see me do it first
and I&#39;m basically going to breathe in
slowly into my stomach then hold that
inhale for two seconds and slowly exhale
something like this okay now close your
eyes put your hand in your stomach and
inhale very slowly through your mouth
only into your belly hold it for a
couple of seconds and exhale really
slowly through your mouth hold a couple
of seconds and one more time keep your
eyes closed
in into the belly hold for two seconds
and exhale slowly now keep your eyes
closed for a second just hear my voice
three things are happening one your
heart rate has slowed down significantly
- every time you exhale you get rid of
carbon dioxide in your blood and three
your mind is calming down no matter how
you started five minutes ago no matter
how you felt 15 minutes ago right now
you feel calmer already and I want you
to keep in mind this feeling don&#39;t open
your eyes yet now I want you to grab
your arms and wrap them around you and
feel the snug hug of someone you trust
this tight hug put some pressure into
the ribcage and that&#39;s the second
sensation I want you to keep in mind
okay so now you&#39;re ready you can open
your eyes now so we&#39;re now inside that&#39;s
enought there this is called the pit and
what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m breathing just
like we did for about five minutes and
what I do is breathe in the stomach then
the chest then the upper chest and then
I dive down and I swim down 10 feet 20
feet 30 feet
and sometimes we swim down while
sometimes we actually pull ourselves
down a line just like this 20 feet 30
feet and something really interesting
happens at 33 feet there&#39;s another
atmosphere of pressure so now your lungs
have gone from the size of a watermelon
to half their size and when that happens
you&#39;re less buoyant which means you
become weight which means you don&#39;t need
to swim down anymore or pour yourself
down this line to go down you let
gravity do the work and you drop down 40
feet 50 feet 60 feet
70 feet 80 feet and sometimes we fall
down to this incredible mystical world
of clouds and trees in the depths of the
jungle
other times we fall down and follow the
light all the way to the depths of the
underworld
now something magical happens down here
on one side your brain is doing all
these incredible things with your body
to keep you alive your heart rate has
slowed down even more your blood flow is
going away from your limbs from your
legs and your arms and it&#39;s focusing
around your torso and the back of your
brain to keep your life and your spleen
is over producing red blood cells and
all of this is called the mammalian
reflex
well this is happening your brain is
incredibly calm and it enters the space
of almost numbness you&#39;re floating in
time
you lose perception of space you don&#39;t
feel a distinction between your body and
the water around you and the jungle
around you and you don&#39;t see a lot of
technology here if a wetsuit on I have a
mask long fins it&#39;s basically a human
body floating in water a bunch of cells
floating in water and that is probably
one of the oldest forms of existence of
life in this planet and somehow I feel a
connection through millions and billions
of years now like every other journey
this journey also has to finish and
sometimes we forget if we&#39;ve been down
there for two minutes four three four
four time has stopped
I&#39;m not exactly sure where I am and it&#39;s
not until you break the surface as you
come up and you take the deep first
breath that you realize where you&#39;ve
been
I don&#39;t know what happens down there but
it&#39;s magical I feel a sense of
connection something that fills me every
time I come up from the underworlds
fills me with this unique energy that
comes from something very very old and
pure and beautiful and if you like me
are spending most of your days thinking
about how to use technology to move our
species and our societies forward I
would invite you to find something that
connects you to nature in a deep way
something that has nothing to do with
technology that has a sense of old old
something something biological something
natural and I&#39;m not suggesting that
tomorrow everybody swims down to 100
feet and comes back up although if you
want to be a free diver and join us
fantastic you could do that but I do
know that the more we allow ourselves to
spend time connecting with nature in
unexpected ways in deep-rooted ways and
let ourselves be vulnerable in between
the lines of light or water or jungle
we&#39;ll probably make better decisions
that are necessary for the future that
we&#39;re building right now with technology
and humanity and our species thank you
