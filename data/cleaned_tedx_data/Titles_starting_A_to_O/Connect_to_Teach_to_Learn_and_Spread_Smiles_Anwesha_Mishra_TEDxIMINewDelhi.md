love humanity empathy connect to the
people to teach to learn to make the
world a better place
zoom out your vision your inspiration
and your aspiration and bring raises
smiles to those people that want to
become something better than what they
already are it&#39;s for those people that
see more that one just meets the eyes
it&#39;s for those that believe in the time
taking presents my name is invasion
Michelle who has a very sore voice 14
years old born and raised in the capital
of Silicon Valley San Jose California
being raised as an Indian American I
consider myself very fortunate to be a
part of the melting pot of both cultures
my cultures have taught me how to face
the problems gracefully and to learn to
admire the wrong deeds so that I won&#39;t
be stuck with your Mis process within me
throughout my life when I was the kids
which wasn&#39;t too long ago
I thought one of the greatest gifts my
parents who could give me was a
cardboard box when my dad used to come
home with this cardboard box in his hand
to give it to me I would feel as if I&#39;d
won the lottery with this cardboard box
I could become anything I could become a
brave pirate that sailed the seas or an
astronaut that went to the moon really
with this box I had no limits being a
three to four year old but it seemed as
it&#39;d be further in age I got from being
that three to four year old the further
I drifted away from my books but it
wasn&#39;t just me it was all of us and this
idea takes me millions of miles away
into a certain direction helps me
connect and rethink my old ideas to come
up with a new objective and this pushed
me for success in the instant challenge
skills which helped my engineering
skills every accomplishment starts with
the decision to try something new I have
always been surrounded by very
supporting people they&#39;ve helped me
analyze correct and reflect much from my
mistakes from there I was encouraged
into not letting others make
same mistakes that I made I was always
an avid speller starting from a young
age I competed in numerous spelling bees
and my preparation for them was around
the clock but I never got a chance to
fully carry it out and I felt just
devastated at the fact that my years of
such hard work would go to waste I
talked to a teacher and they had told me
it&#39;s much more important to focus on the
journey rather than the end outcome and
looking back at it now that advice is so
powerful and that&#39;s exactly what I did
after starting this club I really felt
the teaching spirit even after getting
offers from older kids to teach they
helped me realize that even though I can
can be installing these myself teaching
spelling and teaching kids was what I
love to do the most when I visited India
when I was in just fourth grade I
considered myself relatively social I
wanted to connect more with my family
members and learn more about my origin
in America specifically in our community
there are so many Indian people but it
was different than talking to people in
India in America it seemed to me as if
everyone had a different reason a
different story and a different way of
living in India the similarity within
people seemed so prominent to me but for
a much simpler reason I couldn&#39;t
communicate and that was the language
barrier they had been put up so high
that no one could go through it we had
to have a mediator between us which was
probably my parents translating
everything that I said so one of my
aunts as a teacher and when I would go
and observe and see how she talked her
students I would feel this emptiness
live in me no matter how much I would
try and connect with these kids it
didn&#39;t seem to happen because I knew
that this result would be time taken
and this time taking result led me to
raise of smiles raises smiles and hope
and a goal to bring a smile to each and
every kid&#39;s face children are all unique
and different in their own way and we
are here to help nurture that creativity
and brilliancy we plan to introduce
topics and projects to them that will
help them are the spark of ingenuity to
create and become something greater I
was fortunate enough to found raise a
smile and through this nonprofit
organization I was able to meet and be
acquaintances with so many inspirational
people when you enter a classroom there
are always two perspectives one from the
teacher and one from the students
speaking from the teachers plan
respectively I always put myself in the
students shoes is what I&#39;m teaching
enjoyable is what I&#39;m teaching going to
make an impact on what these students
already know that&#39;s what&#39;s great about
being a student teaching other students
and peers I constantly absorb
information from people around me my
teachers my friends but at the same time
I&#39;m able to share that information that
I just learned and that is really
beneficial racist mouse has had two
projects the first project was called
the cambrian project and in this project
I taught styling and robotics to kids at
our local library the second project was
a first international project and this
was in India I this is called the ashram
project schools ashram school project so
initially I had taught these students of
her voice and video call and just two
weeks ago I went in person and taught
them and listen this was an experience
to remember I entered into this
classroom with 45 girls on the left and
11 boys on the right
I got 66 cold stares right at me waiting
for me to speak to them but nothing came
out of me I had to do and teach them in
my second language tutors Oriya which
was much harder for me since I
previously and initially taught in
English after this rough 45 minutes I
was able to connect with these kids so
well it was so heartwarming
these kids were our orphans
and from the lower class family and they
had left their families and village to
come and get a better education robotics
is a very hard topic to grasp it
involves motors and the prior knowledge
of how motors work but these kids were
able to capture it so well because they
had the interest and when a student has
the interest will encourage to come back
into a classroom you know that the
teacher has done their job their full
scholarship I was invited to the
National Woman&#39;s book Association
conference there I reflected on a couple
of things we often hear that repetition
is key but why is that repeating
something to take endless amount
patience that most of us don&#39;t have and
don&#39;t have time for while leaving these
clubs I often made kids do things over
and over again before they came to me
for assistance but along with repetition
can come rejection the one thing that
were all scared of when I was at this
conference I talked to so many women and
there I was embarrassed of saying how
many times I&#39;ve gotten rejected by so
many people for so many different things
but these women had gotten rejected over
a hundred times and they didn&#39;t have the
fear within them of coming back we had
this radiance to them that seemed
everlasting and that was something that
I would love to have because these women
showed up again even though they got
rejected and they believed in what they
did and they were confident in it when
we think about it children are a lot
like blank canvases new to the whole
world for such a long time they&#39;re like
this because they buy the artist some
time to come up and think of a
masterpiece because this masterpiece
will decide their life this masterpiece
will either end up being a top selling
masterpiece or a masterpiece that&#39;s
thrown in your basement
never
that&#39;s what the artist had to do every
time a kid engages in something new and
learns he says if a brushstroke is
placed through their canvas and as time
goes on the more brushstrokes they
collect the more their masterpieces in
progress of being completed but there
comes this time when there isn&#39;t enough
room on that canvas when that canvas
becomes full and the masterpiece is done
that&#39;s why I plan to tart I target to
teach kids at a much younger age because
then they have a much broader
perspective of what&#39;s to come and what
they will learn when I zoomed out I
ended up on an entirely different
platform which was robotics our team
which has been together for the past
three to four years completed an Sol and
now FTC and with my dad&#39;s indicate a
coaching hug lurk in time we made it to
the championship tournament being our
first year and this much higher and
hardly level one of the awards we won
was called the Kinect award and that
made me think why do we connect with
people there are millions of apps that
help us connect with people there are
books apps and even specialists and
websites the help us connect with people
but the easiest way to connect with
someone is by sparking a conversation
and to do that is to engage and listen
in it when we zoom out we look at the
whole picture and when I zoomed out I
found in my future and if I can do it
anyone can do it you were the yesterday
the last week the last year you were the
two minutes of instant regret and the
two minutes of my accomplishment you are
full of my mistakes errors and mess ups
you are full of the things I want to
forget about the things I want to hold
on to forever
you flood my brain with flashbacks but
never do this with my consent you are
the voice that guides me through the
tough times and the voice that puts me
into number and in quicksand
you are the voice that keeps me up at
night and the voice that puts me to
sleep you hold on to my case care child
who won&#39;t let go of their mother because
you are scared for me
and worried for what I&#39;m going to do you
feel as if I&#39;m gonna forget bits and
pieces of you as time goes on you and my
past and you will be close to me whether
in my head and my way when we zoom out
it&#39;s to look at the whole picture it&#39;s
on how you can make an impact not only
on someone else but in your community
and even in parts of the world zooming
out to me is to look at everything else
not simply on yourself
