so has anyone ever asked you what do you
want to be when you grow up do you ever
want to say I want to be happy I want to
be serene or have you already figured
out your plan do you know what you&#39;re
gonna do for education and a job and
family well in high school I thought I
knew what I was gonna do I went to
college ready to learn everything I
needed to learn to accomplish my modest
goal I am not kidding when I tell you I
just wanted to create world peace
I was pretty original oh I&#39;m a
sociologist now but after that first
year rough year of college I had dropped
out and didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do
as a sociologist I get to answer pretty
interesting questions for example how
can we find science kinds of people how
can we engage all youth with science to
answer these questions I&#39;m part of a
team that studies identities identities
are really important identities shape
our beliefs and our behaviors when
people ask what do you want to be I
think they really want to know who are
you but most people just don&#39;t ask that
question directly unless they&#39;re a
sociologist and they&#39;re studying
identities then we think it&#39;s perfectly
reasonable to ask people to tell us
answers to the question Who am I at
least 20 times when I think about this
question I think about being a mom and a
wife a friend I think about being white
and female I think about being a
professor that I can hear and that I can
see maybe some of you are more visual
maybe you&#39;d prefer to draw a picture of
yourself it can be difficult though to
pick just one image to draw what would
you be doing or wearing in your picture
we let other people know about our
identities in a variety of ways by what
we wear maybe our t-shirts
maybe our hair or tattoos other people
can also make decisions about who we are
even if we don&#39;t claim the identity
maybe based on our height or our skin
color the way we talk our name or where
we live other people can also act as
mirrors how they see us shapes how we
see ourselves okay now based on my
interest in science I&#39;d like you to
imagine for a moment if you were gonna
draw a scientist what would you draw
what would your scientists be doing what
would your scientists be wearing I have
to warn you that one of my favorite
phrases is there&#39;s a study about that
and there is a study about drawing
scientists believe it or not there&#39;s
over 50 years of research on this topic
we would expect that there would be
change over 50 years but still the
stereotype of a white man and a lab coat
glasses crazy hair that persists this
pattern raises a challenging question
how can we engage all youth with science
if some youth don&#39;t fit the stereotype I
spent years trying to answer this
question one challenge has been my own
assumptions I used to think that
scientists were just born geniuses they
didn&#39;t have to work hard they could just
do science or I thought scientists were
just the natural scientists the chemists
the physicists geoscientists even okay
sorry alright so is it a problem is it a
problem to have these images of
scientists it is for me I want everyone
to have the pleasure that I feel
learning new discoveries maybe even
creating new discoveries themselves
science is a valuable resource people
who have science knowledge science
abilities scientific thinking they have
power they have privileges I want
everyone to have
access to science people who know
science they can now even tell the
difference between more and less valid
science and we learned today that&#39;s
really important okay so one of the
questions that I was part of a team
trying to answer was how can we find
science kinds of people when I tell
people that that&#39;s what I want to talk
about or I study oftentimes they just
kind of look at me funny and say okay
that&#39;s what you want to study we had
good intentions with this question we
wanted to make sure that we did
after-school clubs or we disseminated
emerging science we reached everyone who
might benefit from it to do that we did
a survey in a middle school in a large
Midwestern City we surveyed over 400
youth to measure science identities we
first asked do other people see you as a
science kind of person they could pick
not at all a little bit somewhat or
totally we average the scores and we
should show up here yeah thank you that
on average the scores were low about two
or a little bit we next asked do you
think of yourself as a science kind of
person and the scores were a little bit
higher a little bit above a two we could
have stopped there we could have just
figured that on average middle school
kids have low science identities but we
were worried what if some youth have the
potential to engage in science but they
don&#39;t claim the identity because they
don&#39;t think they fit but how could we
measure a discovery orientation a
propensity without using the word
science we discussed this on my team and
we finally came up with an idea we could
ask about characteristics that
scientists have or engage in so are you
curious about the world
do you like exploring nature do you
enjoy new discoveries now the average
from those responses was much higher or
about a three closer to somewhat
even more important for those three
questions
there was only one respondent out of
over 400 who said not at all to all
three questions so do these scores
differ by gender and race ethnicity yes
for the science identity items but no
for discovery orientation for discovery
orientation very similar responses but
for the identity items the boys who are
white had significantly higher scores
than the youth and the other categories
I find these patterns disturbing I want
all youth be able to be able to claim a
science identity can we do anything
about this yes and many people are
working to make science more inclusive I
had the good fortune to be part of
another study where we randomly assigned
comic books or essays to over 800 high
school students again and a large
Midwestern city so let&#39;s go to the next
slide and these are the comic books okay
so after they could read the essays or
the comics the youth took a survey we
asked them would you want to read more
material like this I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not
surprised to hear that the youth that
got the comics wanted more more than the
youth that got the essays what is really
powerful though is that when we break it
down by science identity the youth that
got the comics with the low science
identity they wanted to read more as
much as the youth that got the essays in
the high science identity group let that
sink in for a minute
that is really powerful that means it&#39;s
something about the way we communicate
science not necessarily something about
the kids I saw how the comics connected
with youth in another setting we did an
after-school Club with 5th graders in a
high poverty school
in the first week we gave all of the
kids the comic books a couple months
later we were doing an activity we were
trying to understand the immune system
so we had some kids who were an
attacking virus we had some kids who
were the skin a barrier to that virus
and we had some kids that were the
immune cells they were gonna play this
out as soon as I said immune cells one
boy jumped up ran over to his backpack
pulled out the comic books from two
months earlier ran over to me and showed
me the page with the immune cells at
that moment I realized his attachment to
the comic book showed me how important
access to science can be okay
analogy alert I really want this point
to come home okay so hang in there with
me for a minute let&#39;s imagine a mountain
with a fantastic view and everyone wants
to get to the top there&#39;s two paths one
path is well-maintained
lots of encouraging people along the way
helping people reach the top of the
mountain the other path is rough not
well-maintained for you and few people
encouraging the travelers and maybe some
it even discouraging them the people on
each path they don&#39;t know there&#39;s
another path who&#39;s gonna make it to the
top and how would each explain their
success or their failure okay it can be
tempting to think that there are some
groups in the United States that just
aren&#39;t into science but our evidence
suggests it&#39;s not the kids the problem
is the packaging the stories being
relevant showing images of scientists
from around the globe throughout history
a great diversity of scientists who are
doing amazing things amaya science kind
of person when I started this work I
didn&#39;t think so but through the research
process I changed my mind I realized I
really loved the comic books I loved
learning about microbes and genetics
and viruses I loved learning along with
the youth in our after-school programs I
also realized I&#39;m a social scientists
that study is getting people into
science and maybe that makes me a meta
scientist okay so in my life
there were many cues that I had a high
discovery orientation even though I
don&#39;t remember anyone encouraging me to
claim a science identity not even after
I won a science fair in seventh grade
and again in eighth grade as I mentioned
I dropped out of college the important
thing about that is that I had time to
explore many possible future selves
thankfully one of my cousin&#39;s Patti she
saw in me the social scientists I could
become she urged me to take a sociology
class I did and I was transformed all of
a sudden the world makes sense like it
had never had before I took another one
I took another one I stayed for a decade
and I earned three degrees and now I
teach sociology okay a little bit
passion there all right
so I&#39;m I&#39;m just so grateful I had people
who could see Annie the social scientist
I could become I want everyone to have
that finally the answers to my burning
questions how can we find science kinds
of people we don&#39;t have to search we are
all science kinds of people how can we
engage all youth with science that&#39;s
where we need to invest we need creative
connections to help youth find the kind
of science that will matter to them what
will engage them what will be
interesting that&#39;s what we need to
really work on I kept wait to find out
the creative connections that all of you
will find to help all of us engage in
science thank you
