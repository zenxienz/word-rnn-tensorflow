have you ever thought about who would
you be today if you followed your
childhood dream let me tell you about my
dream how I pursued it followed it and
laughed what I love to do most when I
was six years old I saw something that
completely blew my mind
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah Wow
when I was six years old I saw that I
saw the first time I live skateboard a
kickflipping and I was like amazed I
knew at in that moment this is what I
want to be I want to be a skateboarder
yeah so but how could I learn that it
was 1996 I was 11 years old then I said
ok now I start but skateboarding was
totally at the bottom to that times
there were no skateboarders in my little
hometown so jahausa 2,500 people nobody
there that could skate except 10 inline
skaters so that&#39;s how I look totally
padded up because it was in the book so
my mother took me to the skate store and
we get some pets for me that was good
and we tried to figure out how the skate
works with the help of the books but the
thing was I was inventing like crazy
tricks which probably went with any
tricks so I had another idea and every
day when it was raining you cannot skate
because rain and water totally destroys
your board your bearings and I was small
I had not a lot of money so once gave
out had to last like one year so when it
was raining I was sitting in front of
the television for like hours and there
was a program called a Nickelodeon maybe
remember it and it was Nickelodeon Sky
TV and was always in the in the in the
break between the the things sometime it
came like three times a day and I would
wait in front of the television until it
came and I recorded it and edit it
together to my own skate edits from
which I could learn yeah that&#39;s
basically how I learned to skateboard
and so I was getting better and actually
that is a photo of me keep flipping down
the stairs where exactly I saw the
skateboarder when I was six years old
because there was my school and school
is also very important topic for me
today because when I was in this primary
school you see behind me
that&#39;s my primary school actually I was
having my first like music I had my few
music teacher and he gave me two wood
blocks because he wanted to give me some
mark and he said please clap with the
wood blocks to the beat and I tried to
clap to the beat but actually I didn&#39;t
know what a bit was
so I did something and he was coming to
me and took away this wood blocks and
threw them in the corner and said you
will never be able to play any music
instrument you have no talent and I was
like yeah funny now but back at that
time I was pretty traumatized and I was
like oh I will never try again never
never in my whole life in school we are
very often worn down we are one try
society one try wrong answer again so
the good thing was when I went with my
skateboard and after one year of trying
all alone I went to a bigger city called
Tom Scott and I had my first skate
experiences there and I met other
skateboarders and it was very very shy
because I was always like beaten down
like in school like you remember but the
skateboarders were totally reacting
differently to what I did I failed again
and again I were and I was not really
good to that times but no matter what I
did like trying was winning and to
illustrate that I will now show you a
trick which I tried in the last week&#39;s
you Ali Ali working together
[Music]
yeah thank you thank you there was an
old slide nollie flip off it took like
30 seconds in here but it took me like
three days in reality but you see like
the process it&#39;s fun is we enjoying it
we we embrace failure we love to fall
down and we love to support each other
in their individuality to be a better
self of themselves so to speak I escaped
but now like for 21 years and I failed
down I don&#39;t know how many times 1
million times I have no idea but I
always stood up again and I learned so
much about me and my individuality and I
learned to be tough I let her learn to
stand up again and again and again and
again because I know like I need it for
just to jump to make a little jumper or
with some bench
I need like one year but I knew that if
I would stay on skateboarding and stay
on my goals I would go there I would I
would I would be successful in what I do
and so we escape order we can imagine
something and we always say what if so
like what if I grind on this pole thing
and skate down the volcano no problem in
Indonesia or what if we jump over this
gap on the beach and and use it as some
form of creative expression for ourself
what if we slide on this on this curb on
the Spanish here and also in front of
the volcano in Indonesia or we if we
jump down the stairs and again we keep
flip the board and do a 360 kickflip
catch the boat and roll away in the
sunset Wow as I wanted to do oh if we
skate with monkeys so that that&#39;s
actually awesome pictures from my work
where we really just did that and said
what if and I just rolled down I
remember that what if we skate with
monkeys and everybody was like laughing
it was was like a joke yeah we skated
with monkeys but in the end we went
there and we skated with monkeys so let
me show you how it how then this dream I
had of becoming a skateboarder looked
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you thank you so that this was
more like my work as a cinematographer I
was also a skateboarder on the trip but
mostly I was behind the camera to bring
out my vision I had when going to
Indonesia and skate in Bali and spots
where nobody has ever skated before and
so actually I am a filmmaker I&#39;m a
visual artist and the interesting thing
is like how to transfer the things I
learned from skateboarding to my art and
so I was at the packs of it say in Italy
which is like beautiful as you can see
and I wanted to do a shot there and I
had a dream on new technology whoo-hoo
and I already had it planned out but the
problem was that it cut the top of the
mountain and I was like no okay I&#39;ll
make it and then I went with my wife she
was with me there and we went around the
whole leg and I was like how can I do it
but through all the experience I had and
through my vision and through me also
through my skateboarding I came up with
a solution
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so the solution a lot of people ask me
about that and I didn&#39;t tell them so
today I will tell you so it was of
course a reflection of the sea and what
I actually did was I filmed the
reflection of the sea and I just flew
with the drone like straight over the
lake in the morning I came there for
like three or four days every day five
o&#39;clock in the morning alarm ring baby
bit and then go there waiting for the
perfect son
and then I kicked flipped it basically
so it&#39;s it&#39;s the same thing you saw in
the beginning it&#39;s a kick flip off the
framing I just turned the framing around
film the reflection turn it around kick
flip the reflection and you have the
normal framing and you don&#39;t care about
not seeing the top of the mountain
because you&#39;ve seen it in the reflection
like that so um this is a rock in the
Sexson Switzerland and I had the idea
for a new film that some breakdancers
could make a headstand on top of that
and the problem was that we never
climbed before
but as you know the principle which
right so which right went up there also
we stood up so many times in the morning
again and again until with professional
help we could get up there have a look
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so the great thing is we had a vision
and the vision was like let&#39;s make the
best breakdance video ever and we
believed in it and we had we had a dream
and like breakdance and skateboards
pretty similar failing is also a big
part of breakdance and so our
communication over the way we approach
the things were perfectly fitting
together and so we did that let&#39;s come
back to the kids so for me like a lot of
teachers and adults say well you
skateboard and why don&#39;t you do anything
like real with your life because
skateboarding is not like a job but
actually I learned so much from
skateboarding as I as I said before we
went with our skateboards all around the
globe
and now just let&#39;s see what reactions we
got from six years old in countries all
over the world and how they are reacted
to our skateboarding
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
so I realized that it was not just like
an individual thing of me alone being
like psyched by skateboarding when I saw
it like for the first time everywhere in
the world we saw like the same thing
happening again and again and the way
kids reacted and how their brains like
exploded in how they thought wow I can&#39;t
be that skateboarder one day and how we
put them on the skateboard and just say
try and you see how how they&#39;ve felt
again and again but they enjoyed failing
and that&#39;s like the point I want to make
today we have to embrace failing we have
to embrace trying because it&#39;s it&#39;s a
big big part of it and what shapes us to
what we are today and so maybe on will
not become a skateboarder if you want to
try no problem comes me but at first we
can not judge people when they fail but
support them and if somebody gives the
wrong answer just ask you man why do you
give this answer what how do you get to
that idea and just be society which
values trying failing and embracing our
possibilities we have as a society when
we help other individuals to get better
through failing and yeah embrace the
future thank you
[Applause]
