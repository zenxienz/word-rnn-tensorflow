good evening everyone my name is Melissa
Centeno
I am a corporate attorney I am a
graduate of UCLA and of UC Berkeley
School of Law I am a state delegate for
my district and I&#39;m a commissioner for
Los Angeles County but before all of
this I am a Latina I&#39;m a child of
immigrant parents I came from a
low-income household statistically
speaking I&#39;m everything that I&#39;m not
supposed to be right now
I am the 1% and I do not mean the 1% of
Americans that hold the majority of
wealth in our nation I mean next slide
please
the 1.3 percent of attorneys that are
latina thanks to my education and to the
things that my parents did correctly I
get to be here tonight in front of you
an empowered person somebody that can
articulate my struggles and my journey
and that has an opportunity to pave a
path for those that I love for my family
and for my community now I would like to
talk to you tonight about the things
that have helped or hurt me along my way
I could stand up here and talk to you
about GPAs about entrance exams and
putting together the most competitive
application for college but I want to
talk about something more personal
something a little harder to talk about
and possibly even uncomfortable I want
to talk about emotional intimacy between
parents and children and how it impacts
their ability to succeed not only in
school but in life the old method
teaches us that parents need to push the
kids - what they should be doing
sometimes even smothering them in
academics in sports and music while at
the same time inadvertently leaving them
woefully underprepared for the mental
and psychological challenges they&#39;re
going to face inevitably as they try to
self actualize and reach their highest
potential so how do we do this how do we
take the technical skills and combine
them with the emotional strength and
mental strength that&#39;s necessary for our
children to face the real-world
challenges ahead I believe that there
are three main actions that we can take
to make this happen next slide it&#39;s
about getting in sync with our
children&#39;s moment to moment experiences
okay number one is listen and empathize
this means being able to put yourself
into another person&#39;s shoes to think to
yourself if I was them and if I was
living this moment what would I need
what would I feel what would I need from
my parents to feel supported when I
started at UCLA I was on financial aid I
had chosen the least expensive meal plan
because I wanted to be savvy about my
finances and about the loans that I&#39;m
taking on under this meal plan students
needed to go to their breakfast lunch
and dinner within a certain window of
time if you weren&#39;t there in that window
of time you didn&#39;t get that meal so in
my first semester at UCLA I had evening
classes that really cut it close on that
window on one particular night I was
asking a professor some questions and in
spite of running across campus to try to
make it I missed that window so that
night I went back to my dorm hungry and
I tried to do my studies but my
peripheral vision kept going to my
roommates snacks chips cookies juice
I know man did I want those snacks but I
couldn&#39;t get myself to ask and truth be
told my parents could have afforded to
get me these snacks but that history of
seeking what I needed through them
wasn&#39;t established so I didn&#39;t even
think to call
so it became unnecessarily hard of
course being hungry sporadically is not
helping you and your studies so we need
to listen and to empathize if we can&#39;t
listen we&#39;re not gonna know what our
children need studies have shown that a
history of low emotional intimacy leaves
children shy and conflicted about
seeking attention and about seeking what
they need and this could leak even
further into not being able to seek out
mentors which are critical to doing well
so we listen and we empathize the second
thing we do we create excuse me we place
a high value on education as a means to
a better life
so as I stated my parents did not do
everything correctly but in this arena
they shined they inspired and they
accommodated me to do my best and they
truly saw the value of education even
the monetary value of education my
educational journey began in Community
College
when I started at Cerritos Community
College I was holding a full-time job
and going to school full-time like
several of my peers I felt this urge
that I needed to help my family
financially as soon as I could I wanted
to bring value to my parents by the
middle of my first semester I had
mediocre grades at best and it made me
stop and think
I don&#39;t want mediocre I want excellence
I want to go to my dream school I want
to go to UCLA and whether I want to
admit it or not working this full-time
job is keeping me from putting in that
studying time that I need to get those
grades so I worked up the courage to
talk to my parents about it and I was
afraid
I thought they&#39;re gonna think that I&#39;m
lazy that I&#39;m not contributing even
though I&#39;m a grown adult now when I
brought this up to my mom she looked me
in the eye and she said mija
the way that you bring value to this
family is by focusing on your education
you bring more to us by going to that
classroom than you do
by holding this job Wow
that changed everything by the end of
that semester I had straight A&#39;s it was
the first time in my life that I had
seen straight A&#39;s on my transcripts and
I realized the power that I had but it
only happened because my parents were
able to emphasize the value of education
next slide so attentive and reliable
emotional relationships are the basis
for the sense of security and not only
for a sense of security but for the
ability to recognize our needs and to
have a strong sense of self so we listen
and we empathize we place a high value
on education the third and final action
we create a positive frame of reference
so a frame of reference you can think of
it almost like different sunglasses
rose-colored glasses the pair that you
have on is going to affect the way that
you see the world and the way that you
see yourself humans create their frames
of reference based on their environment
and their families children imitate
their parents they believe their parents
they mirror what their parents project
on them if we have fears anxieties and
doubts about our children&#39;s abilities or
we don&#39;t see their full potential they
are gonna have those same fears doubts
and anxieties we live in a time of
historically high rates of anxiety
depression even suicide among some of
our most challenging and noblest
professions including doctors and
attorneys
I think that we can change this through
these actions when I started in high
school I began with a lot of my other
cousins that were around my same age one
of my younger cousins got placed into a
special education program right at the
beginning of ninth grade this was
interesting to me because up until that
point we had been in all the same
classes
my cousin hadn&#39;t shown any of the
classic signs of having special needs
but she got placed here when I talked to
her about it she said well the high
school said I need to be here my
counselor said I need to be here so I
guess it is where I&#39;m at I told her what
does your parents say she said I just
told you what they said this is both the
combination of not placing that high
value and realizing look they&#39;re
potentially taking something away from
my child that is so important an
opportunity if it was not for my cousin
Liz an older cousin we had that acted as
a parent and as someone that got in sync
with us they knew she knew who we were
she came every single day to that high
school to the principal&#39;s office
advocating for my cousin thinks she
didn&#39;t belong in this program how did
she get in here for better or worse this
has been a problem historically in our
country and in the state that children
get filtered in these programs because
of language barriers so socio-economic
reasons or behavioral issues I&#39;m not
sure which one of these got her there
but she was there but Liz stayed there
until they took her out of that program
my cousin went on to take AP classes in
that same subject she graduated from our
high school with honors and she went on
to become one of the 14% of Latinos who
have attained a bachelor&#39;s degree and so
much of it was because somebody was
their luck it shouldn&#39;t be so
serendipitous that we are accomplishing
these things next slide
and it&#39;s so important education is the
foundation upon which all other aspects
of personal and economic well-being are
built this is from the US Department of
Education next slide yet more Latinos
live in poverty
then attained a bachelor&#39;s degree I
truly believe that we can help to change
these numbers by learning how to combine
technical excellence which we have
gotten better at understanding with
emotional intimacy with daily
interactions with our children we were
are trying to listen and to empathize
where we are creating values in our
family that show look we think education
is important we understand its value and
you as a person and as it&#39;s not a terry
value like the previous slide said it
affects your jobs it affects the
neighborhood&#39;s are gonna live in it
affects your health the food you eat the
water you drink your life and for many
of us there are going to be obstacles
where we need this mental strength so
that we don&#39;t define our value by what
other people tell us trying to get to
excellence there are gonna be failures
there are gonna be ups and downs and if
we don&#39;t have our children have the
emotional strength to know who they are
to have a sense of their value and a
sense of their worth they will let other
people tell them and with statistics
like this trust me there are people
ready to tell them that they&#39;re not good
enough I believe that if we can learn to
use these tools if we can combine text
technical excellence with the emotional
and mental strength not only can we
change the lives and the futures of our
children we can change the world thank
you
