so are you looking at my tics pun
intended
yes I said I yes I did say T ICS tics
I&#39;m going so I&#39;m Hannah and I have
Tourette syndrome I&#39;m going to share my
experience of living with the complex
condition called Tourette syndrome so
I&#39;m going to go straight into an
activity with you so if you can stand or
sit you can do this either way Stan
you&#39;re not seen so I&#39;m going to give you
three actions and you&#39;ll have to join in
if you feel embarrassed I&#39;m not gonna
pressure you but it&#39;s a lot of fun so so
I&#39;m gonna give three actions so the
first one is pump your arms so do this
for me
number two number two you stomp your
feet and three is a small yo-yo-yo-yo
hundred okay and stop okay you got that
okay so we&#39;re gonna do a few round to
this so that you understand or sit
whatever is coming so ready folks
cool so put your arms like you&#39;re at the
gym or milking a cow and it&#39;s done
I&#39;m sorry
three yeah and again or to get that one
two three one one carry on and stop you
can sit down now how do some raise of
hands how that makes you feel sorry so a
list of things of how that makes you
feel of things I feel every day so tired
embarrassed or self-conscious yeah I go
through them things most days but can
you imagine doing this a cinema watch
trying to watch film imagine doing this
a crowded bus stop waiting to go about
your day imagine doing this on a in a
classroom environment we ticked the
locker sneeze so for everyone you can&#39;t
have this nice it comes and you have to
sneeze that&#39;s not the tics I can&#39;t
control them so different reactions I&#39;ve
had from people are either shocked or
scared but positive reactions I&#39;ve had
from people they&#39;ve asked me am i okay
this hasn&#39;t been the boss in the shop in
the street and that makes me feel so
much better that someone took the time
out they don&#39;t have to but it&#39;s just
nice to know that someone&#39;s aware of
what I have and they&#39;ve also told their
stories about their friends who have
torts and shared it with me
I&#39;m going to share a small anecdote with
you so I&#39;ll travel quite a lot I got to
London a few years ago I got to London
I&#39;ve recently travelled France Paris on
my own with a friend which is the first
time abroad a few years ago I went the
Isle of Wight I met a family called the
small ones who I did a crate
Tourette&#39;s creative project with and met
them a few years ago so I asked them
could I pop down to the Ottawa to visit
them so I stayed with them for a week
it was lovely but I tried so I traveled
from coming back or travel from the Isle
of Wight to Birmingham two and a half
hour train journey I imagine I read
nothing on the train because Tourette&#39;s
can beast so Landon I didn&#39;t get on the
train because I was sat next to a
gentleman who&#39;s clearly on his laptop
trying to work and my tics were trying
to touch his nose you know and I didn&#39;t
want to invade his personal space and
because I can&#39;t help it
I had to fold up and stay like that for
two and a half hours and that he&#39;s so
going to war and that&#39;s the only time my
body hurts because I can&#39;t tip and I
don&#39;t have the space to tick so imagine
I didn&#39;t travel down to the Isle of
Wight to see that family it clawed the
beach and explored your height new
places
so imagine imagine I didn&#39;t imagine I
imagined I didn&#39;t
so I still do what I do
I still socialize I still travel still
go to the cinema I also still do work
tick workshops for places of work
education and creativity Eve so stay
visible even when it&#39;s painful thank you
[Applause]
