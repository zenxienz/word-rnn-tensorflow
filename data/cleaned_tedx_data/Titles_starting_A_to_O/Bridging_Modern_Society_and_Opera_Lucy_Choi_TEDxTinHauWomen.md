I want to begin with two questions and
dissipation first question how many of
you have been to a movie more than three
times this year please raise your hand
Wow a lot of you thank you second
question how many of you have been to an
opera or classical music concerts more
than three times this year please raise
your hand I&#39;m so glad to see some hands
thank you when you go to a movie and if
you didn&#39;t like it what will you do you
will say next time I&#39;ll pick another
kind of movie and I&#39;ll go again and if
you still didn&#39;t enjoy the second time
you will say next time helping another
kind of movie and go again but you still
go
what about classical music concerts in
Opera many people told me I&#39;ve been to
the Philharmonic
or opera once and I didn&#39;t like it so I
guess it&#39;s not my cup of tea
they&#39;re obviously biased people have for
classical music and opera my name is
Lucy I was born and bred in Hong Kong
I&#39;m very passionate about opera going to
opera singing to opera learning about
opera last year I even started my own
opera company more than musical which is
a registered nonprofit in Hong Kong we
are making opera accessible and
approachable to everyone we are bridging
the modern society and opera before
there were TV and movies or press
theaters there was this groundbreaking
art forms which challenged the social
norms which push people out of the
comfort zones and they make political
statements opera is meant to be hip and
modern and challenging in the following
I&#39;m going to share with you my journey
with Oprah the Society&#39;s journey with
Oprah and why opera matches to you and
to me and I&#39;ll leave you with a
challenge I hope by the end of this talk
you all will be saying whoa I&#39;m
definitely going to an opera
my music journey began with my piano at
home I had my first piano lesson when I
was 10 years old I really enjoyed it and
I practice a lot my parents after their
long day of work they came home and they
said to me can you please stop
practicing because it&#39;s so noisy music
became my very best friend no matter how
I feel happiness sadness boredom
excitement music can help me to release
all these emotions in ways that words
cannot describe music has been my
emotional outlet and my best companion
and then I moved into university I
became a music student majored in piano
as you can imagine I was very hair very
healthy it was like the best thing ever
happened to me or I do everyday was to
learn about music and to practice but
not long after I&#39;ve started my degree
around six months my arm around this
area started to hurt whenever I practice
on the piano it was like there were
needles flowing through my blood streams
every day a few moments later it got so
bad that I have to stop playing
completely because it was so painful
that I couldn&#39;t even hold a pen or
chopsticks I was completely devastated I
didn&#39;t know what to do I went to a
physiotherapist
two or three times a week I have no idea
how long does it take to recover or
would I ever be able to recover but in
order to continue I need an instrument
to graduate I need an instrument which
doesn&#39;t require my hands so I started to
sing and it is the next best thing ever
happened to me Oh in the sudden I became
a voice students and learning singing is
completely from
a physical instrument because now at
this time the instrument is inside my
body it takes a lot of imagination and
self exploration to learn singing
sometimes I got really confused my voice
teacher she would say to me Lucy I
cannot cut myself apart to show you how
you should coordinate your inner muscles
or your vocal cords you have to figure
out by yourself
and so I practice a lot it means a lot
of singing plus screaming plus yelling
and a few months later my voice started
to change it become rounder I become
louder but the most important is I got
so much more deeply connected to my
inner self because singing is such an
honest and delicate process when I was
singing in front of people I felt like I
was learning their Nicky because there&#39;s
nothing to hide and nowhere to hide
music singing has to be pulled out
straight from my heart and at the same
time I started to learn about opera
which is the next spec treasure I found
in classical music even though most of
the operas were here today were written
in a hundred to 150 years ago still the
drama remains because Oprah is all about
human relationships and emotions
emotions that we all share today love
hatred disappointment jealousy longings
all these emotions are being wrapped up
in beautiful singing music together with
text visualization Orchestra complement
all these pieces are being carefully
constructed together to be a very
complex art form to me opera is the
floating architecture which is beautiful
and it touches my heart
so I finally graduated as a voice
student and I became an opera fanatic
and then I moved to London to continue
my education London the heaven for
classical music lovers I went to almost
all the productions at the Royal Opera
House always sitting at the very top
with my student tickets when I look down
to the stage the singers look tiny to me
but the voices were so powerful that it
penetrates through all the space
conquered over the orchestra and came
into my ears very clearly how much
effort and practice and technique does
it take apart from singing
they were also telling a story they were
telling me that I am a weakness of their
story in those few hours I could just
sit there emerge myself into the beauty
the drama the love the pain that opera
brought me the emotions got so intense
that what my heart was pounding my hands
were sweating and I was even following
the breath of the singers sometimes when
the productions were being extremely
well done all the audience were being
connected emotionally because we were
inspired and engaged and we started
turning in to the people next to our
seat even we were strangers and then we
start talking about how great the
singers were how happy we were how full
of joy we were and how we experienced
something magical together something
that couldn&#39;t be found in normal daily
life from my seat apart from the stage I
also saw these audiences sitting right
in front of the stage with the most
expensive tickets
can you guess who they are they are a
wave of the silver-haired generation so
they were pretty old
and I was there thinking like if Oprah
meant to be an elderly entertainment and
if it is then what is the future of
opera and if it is then what&#39;s wrong
about me why would I enjoy it so much
earlier I mentioned opera is meant to be
hip and mordant let me give you two
examples the first example is the most
famous French opera written by besaid
which is Carmen you must have heard some
music from common including this one see
Gina
Macie Sharma thank you
[Music]
[Applause]
so this music was taken from the aria
urban era sung by common in the Opera
common is a beautiful gypsy lady or
means fell in love with her one day she
was being put into jail because she
initiated a fight and in the jail she
managed to seduce the officer don&#39;t you
say to release her by singing and
dancing around him so don&#39;t so they fell
in love with her and even follow her to
become a smuggler as the story goes on
come and then fell out of love with him
and she would rather die than to be with
him anymore and so he killed her a story
like this is kind of acceptable today
you can see similar stories in TV and
movies all the time but this story was
completely unacceptable in 1875 women as
those days they couldn&#39;t be seen singing
dancing drinking in the public not to
mention fighting there were not even
sexually free be say he challenged or
dystocia norms so guess what happened at
the Opera premiere it was a complete
failure it was being considered
outrageous and provocative he says he
was convinced that he has written the
worst or probe failure in history and he
actually passed away in the same year
the next example is the most famous
Italian opera La Traviata written by
rarity this opera is about a beautiful
young lady who&#39;s named Violetta
she&#39;s a courtesan a courtesan is a
mistress for the rich at those days in
Paris having a collison was common among
the rich at those days but it is not the
topic to be discussed in
Ferdie he deliberately wrote about the
life of a courtesan and said the time is
now 1850 so guess what happened at the
premiere again it was a complete failure
the church banned this opera the royal
families in Europe they refrained from
going because the contents was
considered immoral these masterpieces
they were breaking taboos and they went
beyond socially acceptable boundaries in
their time can you think of some more
than figures who are doing the same to
us today being provocative and
outrageous what about these two ladies
the controversy that Oprah brought is
nothing less than what Lady Gaga and
Madonna are doing today
Oprah is meant to be hip and more than
and challenging last year I started
working with a partner to make opera
accessible and approachable and we were
preaching opera and the modern society
we are achieving that by having a few
adaptations in our productions first
opera has to be shorter
it can&#39;t be free for hours anymore a
production is around 100 minutes which
is commercial movie length secondly no
more big theatres our Productions is
being hot in venues like this one which
is more intimate we remove the barrier
between audience and singers so you can
see the facial expression and the
singers and you can feel their vocal
cord vibration and we believe if you
have this experience you will be amazed
by the power of human voice thirdly our
characters they are more than people in
more than clothing they use cell phones
they use laptops finally we even
introduce a bar this is a powerful wine
and champagne it&#39;s not a bar that you
find in ballet classes
this is part of the performance but
after the performance you can stay
behind have a drink with our singers do
yourself redo your facebook life these
pictures are taken in our June
production of La Traviata so as you can
see there should be no barriers between
you and opera opera is a shared moment
of joy and an escape from the world
opera is meant to be relevant and
enjoyable for everyone I want to
challenge each of you here today by
asking yourself this question what is
your opera where can you get emotional
connected to strangers and be a part of
something that&#39;s bigger than yourself I
urge you to find your own opera to find
your own emotional outlets and source of
inspiration everyone deserves to be
inspired and to be touched and there is
a way for it once mine doesn&#39;t know is
empty and you is enriched so please open
your mind channel yourself into the arts
or whatever you find transformational
tap yourself into your own larger than
life experience and throw yourself into
the greatness the beauty and the higher
ground and I&#39;m sure by doing so you will
be enlightened and enriched thank you
[Applause]
