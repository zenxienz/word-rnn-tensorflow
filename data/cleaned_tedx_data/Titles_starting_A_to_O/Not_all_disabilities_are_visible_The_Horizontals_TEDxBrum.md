a lot of my life is just about just
about walking just about awake I just
about run a volunteer organization just
about connecting researchers to
opportunities to be published just about
sharing it with the right people I
started because I love disability
research disability research for the
disability masses yes
so I started this social enterprise and
I had all these great ideas just imagine
my global vision out there changing the
world but then partway through I had to
have a word with myself
you see I treated my volunteers well but
not me
for me just about sleeping was okay
always working was okay I got burnt out
you see I didn&#39;t stop because I believed
in what I was doing it turns out my body
did not I built a whole organization for
everyone else but I didn&#39;t include me I
don&#39;t talk about accessibility because
accessibility is the bare minimum
inclusivity is our living wage doing
things the way you&#39;ve always done
doesn&#39;t work because things have always
been exclusive and inaccessible so how
do you change it it&#39;s time to get
radical it&#39;s time to do things
differently we&#39;re going to talk to you a
bit about burnout culture so you can
identify it and then when we&#39;re done you
can go and destroy it
it is often said that the word can&#39;t
doesn&#39;t exist but living with an
invisible condition such as sickle cell
anemia I hear the word can&#39;t far too
often I&#39;m told I can&#39;t do this I can&#39;t
do that in order to stay well but in
actual fact there&#39;s nothing that I can&#39;t
do
there are however things that I won&#39;t do
and sometimes these wants are perceived
as a laziness by people who don&#39;t
understand what it&#39;s like to live with
an invisible condition but it&#39;s not
actually laziness these are logical
decisions that I make because I know my
body better than anybody else being lazy
is to not progress not succeed and not
achieve but these are all things that I
am able to do as well as anybody else
being logical is having the ability to
understand my condition so well but I
will know the things that I won&#39;t do and
I won&#39;t feel guilty about the decisions
that I make to not do them so I won&#39;t
apologize for having to use my blue
badge to park in a disabled Bay on a day
when my hip flares up because I don&#39;t
look like somebody who&#39;s had a hip
replacement and will need my other hip
replaced soon I&#39;m not going to feel
guilty because I have had to cancel a
pre-arranged appointment or a commitment
that I&#39;ve had because my body suddenly
gone into a serious sickle cell crisis
and the pain is so bad that 10
milligrams of morphine just about numbs
the pain and I&#39;m also not going to be
stressed out for having to take several
days off work because a common cold or
flu has turned into a serious case of
pneumonia and led to me having to be
admitted into hospital and rushed to
critical care
so there are there&#39;s nothing that I
can&#39;t do but when I&#39;m tired there are
things that I will unapologetically not
do and I won&#39;t say sorry for that
[Applause]
I&#39;ll get comfy I live in perpetual
burnout I hold down a full-time job
while living with a few conditions
you wouldn&#39;t know to look at and it
makes me into a horrible parent and a
pretty terrible friend so I will say to
myself that I&#39;ll pop into town after
work and buy my daughter a birthday
present but when I&#39;ve woken up in pain
and I&#39;m tired even when I&#39;ve just woken
up by the end of the Working Day there&#39;s
nothing left and all I&#39;m good for is
just being rolled into my bed and I&#39;ll
make plans with people I want to see
people I want to do things but when it
actually comes to the time of meeting
people I don&#39;t want to be vertical I
haven&#39;t got the emotional capacity to
think of what to say in a conversation
I can&#39;t negotiate the bus stops and the
other people and the places so it&#39;s much
safer just to stay horizontal the you
cancel you cancel you cancel and
eventually the invitations dwindle and I
feel like I can&#39;t blame people for you
know withdrawing when I don&#39;t put that
much in I feel like I don&#39;t really
deserve friends when I don&#39;t treat them
well it&#39;s being the busy little worker
bee I turn up at work every day and I
try to meet the expectations of my
bosses and meet the needs of the
children that I work with try to make
sure that I&#39;m always being productive
and busy but it&#39;s doing it over the
noise from my body
so I&#39;ll be sitting there trying to talk
to a child and my spine is screaming
because I&#39;ve sat on a chair or my legs
are complaining because I&#39;ve had the
audacity to walk around cheeky and it&#39;s
hitting that point pretty much about

half 12:00 every day when every cell in
my body is screaming just dropped to the
floor close your eyes and stop but it&#39;s
maintaining professionalism which means
being busy it&#39;s getting home so
overwhelmed from all the input from my
body all day that I can&#39;t make decisions
and I know I&#39;m supposed to put really
good fuel into my body and I can eat my
way to health but being so exhausted
that I can&#39;t decide how to do that that
I end up in bed with a bowl of cereal
for dinner it sometimes feels like being
in a room where the walls are getting
smaller and smaller and there&#39;s a door
and I can see that there&#39;s a door but I
can&#39;t get myself through that door
somehow and so you kind of end up hating
myself really because I should be able
to do better than this it&#39;s not so hard
but it also allows us to have really
deep connections with other people
living horizontal lives and through the
conversations that we have when we
connect learning that I don&#39;t actually
hate my body for being how it is that&#39;s
just how it is and that&#39;s fine and I
don&#39;t have to apologize for being a
human who has needs
that&#39;s human and most crucially that I&#39;m
not bad for not being able to fit into
the system as it is because that system
doesn&#39;t work
for people
[Applause]
in my younger years I was told to dream
big and that anything is possible until
I realized in order to achieve my dreams
in this case theater burnout just became
part of that package you see the system
in which we work in says that in order
to achieve high quality things burnout
which is part of how we do it but what
if the cost of burnout is more than just
a few days feeling tired
what if it&#39;s extreme pain loss of
finances and in the worst case death you
see when I was 17 I was accepted on to
National Youth Theatre was really
excited because they said this would be
a snapshot of what living and working in
theatre would be like but on my final
performance I ended up exiting it in an
ambulance and it was at that moment that
I kind of accepted that theater just
wasn&#39;t for me
not because I didn&#39;t enjoy it or because
I wasn&#39;t good at it but because I just
couldn&#39;t see a space in this world for
my tired body to exist in but that&#39;s the
thing about dreams they never really go
away and so fast-forward 10 years and
horizontal was born and horizontal is an
ongoing artistic research project - it&#39;s
asks how do we make high-quality theatre
and also still look after our bodies
seems simple but you&#39;d be so surprised
how little we do that and through that
process the horizontals was formed a
group of women and non-binary people who
live with house conditions and have
achieved amazing things but not
necessarily because they&#39;ve always had
the support in the system to do that but
they&#39;ve done it anyway
horizontal asks a question how can we be
involved in this work conversation when
sometimes we&#39;re horizontal in pain
horizontal poses the question of how can
we challenge the current hierarchical
capitalistic system and work more
horizontally right the point where in us
and we&#39;re not asking can we do this
we&#39;re asking how will we because we
exist and we need spaces to exist in
you see I think we&#39;re in a societal
epidemic I think that we&#39;re still
working in this industrial way which
centers burnout and it feta sizes it and
not only are we doing that we as cogs in
this giant machine have romanticized and
become addicted to it we&#39;ve made burnout
the only way that we can make high
quality projects and work and the cost
of this is affecting us all but have a
think about also who that&#39;s excluding
who&#39;s sitting on the sidelines because
their body just cannot push that far
because they just cannot be involved in
the way that we currently are working
have a think about how we might change
this because the reality is we are now
attaching value to how much we output
how much for how productive we are and
how think about the impact that that has
on people&#39;s worth when we do when we do
that you see we&#39;re often told that we
don&#39;t look sick and you see the
disability rights movement has made
loads of progress in the last 50 years
but still in our spaces there are people
who are invisible and silently dealing
with pain because they would much rather
sometimes work horizontally but they&#39;re
forced into work in this vertical way
and I want to say Birmingham what are we
gonna do about this how are we gonna
change the way that we work so it&#39;s not
just about accessibility but it&#39;s
widening it to centre care because
inclusivity for us is not just a
buzzword it is our living wage and we
cannot do things how we&#39;ve always done
them because the way we&#39;ve always done
them have always been inaccessible and
exclusive so are we going to look at our
ways that we do things are we going to
identify this culture that is killing us
are we gonna identify the burnout in our
lives
stand up resist and destroy it thank you
[Applause]
