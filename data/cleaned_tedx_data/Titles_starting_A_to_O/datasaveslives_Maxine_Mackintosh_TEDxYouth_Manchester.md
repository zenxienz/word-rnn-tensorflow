there are three ways that people use
data some use it for good some use it
for bad and some uses a kind of neither
here nor there they don&#39;t really make
the world a better place but on
aggregate they&#39;re probably not harming
that many people it&#39;s just a really good
sink of resources money skills capacity
people so a good use would be something
that does make the world a better place
something that addresses poverty so he
looks at equality sewing the managers
diseases managers in natural disasters
something bad would be using data for
terrorism or snooping on people&#39;s
private lives and the rest it&#39;s this
kind of stuff it&#39;s the noise we spend
almost six years in total of our life on
social media forty minutes a day on
YouTube 35 minutes a day on Facebook
25 minutes day on snapchat baffling
given a factor breaks down the world
into a few second tranches but it&#39;s not
just social media it&#39;s this constant
noise of our daily lives it&#39;s what the
people aged between 18 and 45 have 80%
of their waking lives captured in some
way digitally it could be the text you
send the things you use with your bank
it could be the music you listen to
it could be your travel card if it&#39;s
digital I&#39;m a researcher in London at
UCL working with Spiros and access in
Martin Rosa my research looks at lots of
these routinely collected datasets to
see if we can use them for good to see
if we can use them to fight diseases and
more specifically to see if we can use
them to predict and then ultimately
prevent dementia so we&#39;ve already talked
about the fact that we&#39;re all going to
be living for longer everyone in this
room will be living till at least a
hundred which means that given the rate
at which science is going now with
dementia at least half of us will die
with this condition 850,000 people in
the UK currently have dementia and it&#39;s
a really harrowing disease so many
people in this room have grandparents
who have it just not just hiring for the
people who have it but it&#39;s also for
their farm
it&#39;s a condition that as you get older
you start to lose your cognitive
function you start to forget things your
personality can change you become
agitated you become aggressive it can
manifest in lots and lots of different
ways with a problem with dementia which
is not dissimilar to a number of
conditions as your brain starts to
deteriorate long before you actually
start to see symptoms and it&#39;s not like
breaking your leg or having a virus
losing your cognition fundamentally
chips away at the human condition to be
a thinking sentient conscious human
being that&#39;s what makes you you and me
me but what even is cognition you can&#39;t
hold it it&#39;s quite difficult to count it
it&#39;s almost a philosophical question
what is cognition and how on earth can
we start to improve something we can&#39;t
really even measure so we&#39;ve got this
problem here we&#39;ve got a disease we
don&#39;t have a cure from we&#39;ve also got
this constant live feed this data flow
this data fingerprint of our lives so
how can we marry the two up how can we
use a digital fingerprint to fight
disease how can we build a digital
fingerprint of cognition so I&#39;m gonna
give you a couple of examples of a few
methods that some data scientists use
they&#39;re not the flashiest
but we&#39;ve already talked a bit about
machine learning this is to give you an
idea of some of the tools some of the
approaches some of the creative ways we
can start to completely rethink disease
through some of these datasets that
basically have nothing to do with
disease so the first one is something
called classification and basically what
a classification method does is it
distinguishes between healthy and sick
people based on some known markers so
I&#39;ve chosen some random markers here so
this is not my research this is a
slightly reduced form to give an example
so let&#39;s say the distance you travel
from your home something called your
radius of movement and there&#39;s some
ideas that actually a radius of movement
does give you a sign about your mental
health and then let&#39;s say on the x-axis
is the number of friends you text the
breadth of your social network so we get
a bunch of people together and we
plot them on this graph and so people
down and the bottom quadrant here they
don&#39;t move very far from home and they
don&#39;t text many people and these of
tan-colored orange-yellow not helpful
color for a presentation they sit the
top top right-hand corner and they&#39;re
the people who are very gregarious they
they text lots people they move far away
so in this example the blue brains of
people who we know have dementia and the
tan brains of people who currently don&#39;t
have dementia and this is a bit where
the algorithm comes in an algorithm is a
rule a set of instruction and the
algorithm goes away and says how can we
best break this data set up to
difference between sick and healthy
people so algorithm does this and
basically says those people who read box
high risk of dementia yeah go figure we
can see that most people in that box do
have dementia the blue brains do yeah we
missed one person we could in someone
else by accident that&#39;s a kind of
appropriate classification error but the
algorithms done quite a good job of
distinguishing between sick and healthy
people now this in itself is an
immensely valuable but then we got a new
person coming in our yellow brain we
don&#39;t know if this person is going to
get dementia or not but we do know how
far they travel from home regularly and
we do know how many friends they text
and so we can predict that actually
given those two markers they&#39;re quite a
high risk of dementia a second example
is something called clustering so this
is similar in some ways to
classification in different and others
the difference between classification
the example I gave in clustering is a
classification you knew what the moving
parts were you knew the markers the
distance from home the number of friends
you text the people who have dementia
clustering in this example allows you to
find new markers these things you
actually have no idea they could be
associated with the disease they could
not be so I again plucked out two random
potential markers here is how anxious we
all are something could look collected
on a on an app for example and then the
actual time you spend on your phone
which all your which will all your
phones collect so this time we plot a
whole bunch of people a whole bunch of
brains on this graph this time they all
have dementia and we write an algorithm
this is something called an unsupervised
learning algorithm and we say find us
the group&#39;s cluster people together
poscar people in similar groups are
there are next to people who are like
them
so the algorithm works away and comes
back with these four groups now
obviously in this example we could have
all seen that ourselves imagine if this
is across millions if not billions of
data points so we&#39;ve got four groups
here why is that valuable why it&#39;s
valuable because then you go into those
groups and you say why have they been
pushed together is it that the blue
group everyone has black hair they all
send over 500 snapshots a day do they
have a particular blood pressure do they
have a particular medical history you&#39;ll
start to realize that groups have
similar things in common and that&#39;s
useful because when you look at a
disease you can&#39;t just look at dementia
it&#39;s a massive disease super
heterogeneous this allows you to a in
cover new markers the hair color the
family history the number of snapshots
they send a day it also allows you to
break apart a disease into small bits it
allows you to be more specific in your
interventions allows you to think about
redefining diseases the third and final
example of a kind of method and a kind
of creative approach we can use to find
new cures for disease is something
called patent mining so think of this is
like the Amazon shopping cart but for
dementia so when you&#39;re on Amazon you
buy something so the other day I bought
face paint and stencils because I was
going to a fancy dress party and I&#39;m son
said you know what Maxine you look like
someone who needs a leopard print
leotard and I was like you know what I
really do I really do so I bought my
leopard print leotard imagine if we did
this approach but for dementia so
imagine all these different pathways are
different shopping carts different
journeys people go through let&#39;s take an
example of how often you go and see your
doctor so our friend on the in the green
path here sees their doctor seven times
and then the brain is the point in which
they get a diagnosis so let&#39;s say they
have a prescription infection scan scan
prescription infection scan it&#39;s not
necessarily the value of those
appointments or the values you get from
those results but it&#39;s just the fact
that they had that pattern so much if we
did this over millions and millions of
different patients we realize actually
maybe in a given time prescription
infection scans can pressure quit from
the flipster understand is a really
common pattern the people who ultimately
get dementia have so it means the next
time someone has prescription in fact
Skan Skan you can say whoo-whoo I know
the next thing here is it&#39;s prescription
but then I know the later on it&#39;s
ultimately going to be dementia so that
means that we can start to intervene
early and push the diagnosis saving
potentially years which could be the
difference between someone having a
curative therapy or being beyond help so
we can push all of these datasets
together we can take this smorgasbord of
random datasets they can be with what
you watch on YouTube they can be what&#39;s
in your medical record you could be what
you spend your money on in your bank
they could be what you Google what&#39;s on
your Facebook there are some problems
with with putting all these data&#39;s
together but on the surface of it a lot
of these have basically nothing to do
with health but this allows us to
uncover new markers new markers any
disease the threshold of those markers
would think about new ways of
classifying diseases it allows us to
create subgroups of patients and in turn
create subgroups of diseases our
hierarchies of diseases are false
diseases are not big one or more first
blobs they&#39;ll made up of lots and lots
of different moving parts and also how
diseases evolve over time on one day
you&#39;re not a dementia patient the next
day you are that&#39;s not the reality of
how disease a kick in but also quite
importantly why are these tambourines
always super healthy what is it that
makes them resilient so in turn we can
create a fingerprint a digital
fingerprint of cognition that goes from
a sick to healthy it&#39;s like a risk score
for your life so how can this be
actioned well we take our friend here
who&#39;s unfortunately got a blue
fingerprint which means high risk in our
example currently a young person
currently perfect cognition super-thin
healthy 100% then but because we know
that they&#39;re a blue fingerprint we know
that this is that trajectory of decline
we know they&#39;re going to get dementia we
know the gain I get anxious we know that
they&#39;re going to start forget things so
in the future when we have a cure we
have an intervention we could intervene
there a poster in the red zone which
means that person&#39;s cognition remains
happy and healthy and perfect for longer
so have a think about what your data or
even your meta data says about you
think about a life event you&#39;ve had it
could be dramatic it could have been
gradual how might have that being picked
up in your data sets these seemingly
boring seemingly routinely collected
data sets and think about the
organizations that have that data are
they using it for good are they using it
at all for value and if not why but if
they are they&#39;re using it ethically and
how can you champion how can you
advocate the better use of your data for
things that really matter because that
could be the difference between
someone&#39;s life being lost or being saved
so when your next sitting at the end of
the kitchen table posting your 15th
Instagram photo of the day and like all
of us have had our parents say come on
look up engaging conversation get off
your phone you can say mom dad don&#39;t rot
I&#39;m generating data and data saves lives
thank you
you
