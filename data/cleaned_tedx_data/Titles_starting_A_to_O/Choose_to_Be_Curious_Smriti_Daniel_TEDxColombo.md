this is Edward the others in 2017
Edward celebrated his 89th birthday and
it made him the oldest living resident
of the handler leprosy hospital but 2017
also marked another milestone for Edward
it was his 75th year as a patient at
handler those of you who quickly did the
math with me there would have figured
out that Edward was just 14 years old
when he was first diagnosed just a
student within days he was
institutionalized and separated from his
family and shocking as that sounds it
was common practice back then because we
didn&#39;t have a cure for leprosy but for
Edward it meant that from that point on
his entire life was behind those walls
from there he lived through a world war
he saw sri lanka gained its independence
from the British he was there when this
country&#39;s long conflict began and there
when it ended nearly 26 years later by
this point of course multi drug therapy
which had debuted in sri lanka and the
1980s had been used to cure edward of
his leprosy but this stigma that proved
so much harder to shake off edwards
parents had passed his brothers and
sisters are dead too but they had been
so ashamed of the leper and the family
that they never told their children
about him and that is why Edward is
still in hospital his family doesn&#39;t
know he exists and he doesn&#39;t know how
to tell them having heard from Edward I
became very curious about what it was
like for someone today to have leprosy
and I found kia a young professional who
after just over a year of treatment was
almost come
pletely cured but kia too had faced
rejection from some of those closest to
him and he was hiding his medical
history from his employers and that was
how for me this became the story of
these two men who decades apart
contracted the same disease by comparing
the trajectories of their lives you
could see how medical advances had made
for radical changes but how in other
ways things still stayed the same this
is what my job looks like as a
journalist I start from a point of
complete ignorance often with just the
seed of a story and a lot of questions
one thing though
after nearly 15 years of work in this
field after many hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of interviews I have come
to suspect that there is a route to this
work one quality that I count as
essential and it&#39;s definitely not that I
am particularly bright it&#39;s not that I&#39;m
a quick learner I write about art and
culture and architecture I write about
health environment and science but I
remember failing chemistry in school and
barely scraping by in math today I know
nothing of art history or criticism so
it&#39;s definitely not that I&#39;m an expert
but I think the thing that allows me to
do this job to go out every other week
and write about something completely new
is simply this I have become good at
being curious and it&#39;s why today I want
to make a case for curiosity and of
course this talk would have no value to
all of you here if it was only
journalists who needed to be curious but
the truth is some of the most success
for people we profile are curious
themselves and you could see how that
would work right to stand out to be
different you first have to be willing
to ask the right questions you have to
be willing to ask what needs to change
what could be better and at least when
it comes to asking questions I feel like
everyone in this room has a small
advantage it can seem like Sri Lankans
are born curious now I have been
interrogated more thoroughly about my
life and work by your average tuk-tuk
driver in this country there have been
by any journalist I know but jokes aside
I rely on my readers to be curious I
rely on you to care about people you
might never meet places you might never
go to issues that don&#39;t impact you
directly and it was only when I began
researching this talk that I realized
how odd that was why are you and I so
curious about things that don&#39;t
necessarily concern us well part of the
problem is that you know part of the
problem of course is that we really
struggle I think as human beings to
figure out some very key stuff but one
of the things that does work is that we
are biologically incentivized to learn a
few years ago a group of scientists at
the University of California conducted
an fMRI study in which they were
investigating the links between
curiosity and memory and what they did
is they watched their subjects brains
when his or her curiosity was triggered
by a trivia question such as what is the
only country in the world with a bill of
rights for cows the study which was
published in the journal neuron in 2014
had many interesting findings one of
them was that feeling genuinely
actually you know triggers have the
reward centers in your brains
essentially what the scientist was
saying is that when you experience
genuine curiosity your body releases
dopamine putting your brain in a state
that allows you to learn and better
retain even unrelated information and so
it was clear that being curious could be
useful unfortunately many of us still
think of curiosity as as something
innate you know as a personality trait
perhaps something we last fully
experienced when we were 2 or 3 years
old and have since grown out of but as
someone who is professionally curious
I&#39;d like to tell you that it&#39;s actually
a skill you can develop it&#39;s something
you can get better at over time and if
this is an experiment that you are
willing to try with me I&#39;d like to share
three lessons just three from my work
step one of being good at curiosity is
being willing to have a conversation and
now I get as someone who speaks to many
many people
I get that small talk is boring I get
that it can be hard to sit down next to
a stranger and think of something to say
but for me the solution both at work and
off-duty has always been the same I
start with a question then I listen very
carefully and then I ask another
question I try very hard not to be
insensitive but I don&#39;t worry too much
about being stupid or coming off as
obvious sometimes I will even ask a
question when I already know the answer
or I think I know the answer and that&#39;s
just because I&#39;ve been surprised so
often I&#39;d like to illustrate this for
you with a story I worked on about the
lives of three trans
in Sri Lanka I first met Ravana and
through Rabanne I met with age and three
of us had many conversations we talked
about everything you might expect and we
talked about what it was like for them
growing up we talked about how hard it
had been for them to come out to their
parents we talked about how humiliating
a job interview can be we even talked
about what it was like to lose a friend
to suicide and then when I thought I had
everything I needed
I asked rev on a question I asked him if
he had ever seen his experiences
represented in a film and he told me
about Ashoka and agamas
flying with one wing it was a story
about a woman who had lived as a man
marrying young and earning a living as a
garage mechanic and then Raavan told me
about his friend
Jonica and he said that John occurs life
had incredible parallels to this movie
and you can imagine my astonishment
because up until this point all my
research had led me to believe that the
transgender community in Sri Lanka were
amongst the most misunderstood but when
I met Jonica everything fell into place
my idle question it turned into the
heart of my story juxtaposing fact and
film to really explore what it was like
to be transgender in sri lanka today so
what in this is useful to you I think
it&#39;s that you don&#39;t need to feel the
pressure of carrying a conversation I
think it&#39;s in trusting that you can sit
down next to a stranger and find value
and insight ask a question
listen go wherever that conversation and
you&#39;re curios
they take you I have always found it
very useful in this line of work to go
looking for the stuff that surprises me
that challenges me that is somehow
unusual because it helps me spot gaps
and recognize opportunities that I might
not have otherwise I recently went to
work on a piece about why Sri Lanka
needed to develop a locally produced
anti-venom I remember being surprised to
discover that the venom composition of
Sri Lankan snakes and Indian snakes was
different even though they might belong
to the same species this difference
which was you know due to things like
diet impacted the effectiveness of the
anti-venom and right there was my story
I feel like I should apologize to those
of you who are afraid of snakes for
having shown you that picture of a sauce
scaled wafer before I began working on
this story every time I saw a snake and
I have seen a few I would scream so high
I&#39;m so sharp that I hit a frequency that
only dogs could hear but something about
sitting down with people who loved these
animals who wanted to protect them who
wanted to understand them helped dilute
my own terror and it made me realize
that curiosity is actually when deployed
in the right context is actually a
remarkably effective response to fear it
can help you find the courage you need
to confront the unknown I&#39;ll make
another suggestion and it&#39;s this be
willing to confront your own bias as
journalists we&#39;re taught to pull
together many different threads to bring
all these perspectives into play but I
think we still sometimes too often end
up resorting to cliches and
reinforcing stereotypes I always notice
mind when I sit down with the artist
Titian afternoon
Shanna&#39;s most recent work was called the
cabinet of resistance and he made it for
the couch in misery espionage and it was
this old filing cabinet with dirty
drawers and into each of these drawers
he put these drawings and photographs
and narratives from the long war from
the north and there was some fascinating
stories in there there were stories of
mechanics who converted their cars to
run on kerosene during the economic
embargo there were women who after many
years of displacement had one valuable
thing and it was their bridal saris and
they gave these up to be turned into
sandbags to protect their families but
perhaps my favorite story of all is of
an elderly woman in Jaffna and she was
there when the public transport system
collapsed and she became tired of
relying on her family as as we will and
so for the first time in her life this
woman learned how to cycle and she later
told Jean Antonin that it was the most
incredibly liberating experience of her
life Shanna when we met told me that he
saw these stories as stories of
resistance and I remember having this
moment you know just listening to him
and thinking this doesn&#39;t fit my
preconceived notions these aren&#39;t my
imaginings of what it&#39;s like to live
through a war and it&#39;s made me realize
that our bias it manifests in many
different ways as both journalists and
readers I think too often we want the
headline to say it all we want our
victims to be weak we want our
perpetrators to be heartless we want to
stuff people in 140 characters
and discuss issues as if they were black
or white and nothing in between I
suppose what I&#39;m really admitting here
is that the hardest thing about
cultivating curiosity is not in having
the conversations or rejecting boredom
or looking for surprises for me it&#39;s in
been willing to investigate my own
prejudice to see the stereotypes that I
unthinkingly replicate it&#39;s in
remembering Shanna&#39;s lesson that we are
all creatures of nuance I suspect and
the real test of your curiosity will be
in how good you are at being curious
about yourself how clearly do you see
your own bias now what will you do about
it
I imagined at this point that you would
also have a question for me possibly you
would ask me this sounds like a lot of
work why bother
well I hope we&#39;ve seen that it has
intellectual and social benefits but I
would also argue that today in Sri Lanka
curiosity is unnecessary you have a new
Right to Information Act it gives you
citizens the right to be curious about
your government and this is in some Idol
exercise it&#39;s something sharper more
persistent an antidote to apathy with a
new constitution on the table you have
to be willing to be curious about the
ways in which the old one failed you and
curious about the ways in which the new
one could be made better on this small
island where communities have been
separated for so long by war by
misinformation by political maneuvering
curiosity genuine curiosity about each
other&#39;s experiences curiosity without
prejudice curiosity without
defensiveness could be the first step to
word building the kind of country we&#39;d
all like to live in that we would like
to leave our children the science
astronomer one of my heroes Carl Sagan
once said something that really just
it&#39;s stuck in my brain he was talking
about earth out there you know in this
vast galaxy and he said our world has
made significant by the courage of our
questions and the depth of our answers
and that is where I&#39;d like to leave you
today with this idea that curiosity can
be a radical act all you have to do is
start with a question
