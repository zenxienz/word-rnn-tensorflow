well do you remember the first time that
you left your training wheels behind to
ride a bicycle that moment when you were
so eager and fearless
that you even gave the first stroke
without second thoughts no risk injuries
capabilities or previous failures
mattered you wanted to ride it and the
time came when you did it solo good
evening everyone my name is a ViSalus I
was born and raised in a middle
low-income family in Mexico City yes New
Mexico that is not going to pay for the
war my mother asked me to say this but
none of my parents attended University
they didn&#39;t give us any wells or any
socially special status to speak of
however they gave us a good heart
strong values and they believe that the
achieve anything great in life we had to
play our chances because at the end
where we came from we had nothing to
lose early in my professional life I had
a fortune to travel a lot and at the age
of 26 I have visited several countries
accumulating quite a high number of
miles finishing through passport pages
and eventually considering home wherever
a taxi driver was waiting for me I met
my soul mate in Colombia who happens to
be Hungarian we have a German daughter
well and after all we decided to put
roots down here in Germany well if there
is a place where hungarians sing
rancheras and mexicans try to speak
Hungarian that would be my house but you
might wonder how I ended up here well I
used to work in one of those worldwide
consulting firms where I used to word
extended periods combined with excessive
travelling which made it a very
exhausting lifestyle it was just too
much for me I met fantastic people I had
the luck to meet people that were always
willing to help me to learn great
opportunities to engage with top
management and at the cutting edge of
business always looking ahead to see her
emerging trends will impact clients and
what we could do about it
Wow it sounds like the perfect job well
it was my dream job but one of the
biggest pitfalls of such large
consulting firms is to get lost and the
world like balancer is reduced to zero
and on top a solid network is
fundamental to success nevertheless I
was doing what most of us do when we
enjoy what we do until I reach a state
where my benefits in obvious ways were
regular happiness low end City and
reduce the stress I&#39;m sure some of you
have been there or others are there
already
well my mornings turnout miserable and
this new thing my alarm became normal in
a few words I lost the passion that
eventually took me there I got totally
lost so much traveling to me to amazing
places but opportunities to continue in
my professional development I started to
dry it out I started to ask for new
challenges new projects and in a way or
another they were always denied and you
started to hear all comments like that
will be too much for you you don&#39;t have
enough experience you know what you
should be patient there are others
waiting longer than you or you have the
talent but you like the experience well
I&#39;m sure some of you have heard
something like this before in a way all
those comments made me think that I
didn&#39;t deserve what I want it and would
you belong to a big corporation that
provides us financial security and
covers your back whenever something goes
wrong that really makes you think twice
before getting out but I knew that this
time like I should not stay in the
single spot but if you don&#39;t losing my
secure job terrified me
the fear of waiting becoming a habit
that was first force and it is true that
we are not generally happy about risk
research says that for most people the
fear of losing $100 is more intense than
the hope of gaining 150 and it is
because we tend to maintain the state of
school and keep things running smoothly
well but this time was different because
I had that nagging feeling when you know
that you are made for more but you like
the space to perform well soon after I
knew that the new rule was a night the
last time that I asked for a change
I receive a telephone call from a
headhunter in Asia telling me that he
was looking for someone with my
experience and a skillset to join a team
in a conglomerate holding company in
Mumbai India Wow
I felt a stomach ache or fear and
curiosity how often do you feel that way
but most importantly how often do you
excuse yourself for not being able to
make a choice giving arguments like I
don&#39;t have the time or I&#39;m not lucky I
don&#39;t have the money I don&#39;t have the
contacts or perhaps I don&#39;t have the
right boss
well sure after I knew I was not going
to justify myself again this time and I
had to make a choice either to
continuing the same company where I felt
totally comfortable or to go towards
something totally new I don&#39;t know where
I had to be autonomous in every single
aspect well soon after I knew that the
new role sorry that the location that
the headhunter told me what I did was
naturally to Google a picture of Mumbai
and this is where I found ya I was
excited when was the last time that you
took the path of where&#39;s curiosity even
though it was risky the hard part about
risk is am I ready what is the worst
that can happen will this change my life
am I fully committed and all these
questions and more will come to
overwhelm us to the point that we have
to sabotage ourselves and decide to
continue in the same spot just because
we feel secure but have you ever felt
something deep down pushing you towards
a different direction the thing is that
making choices is not purely logical
it&#39;s of course it&#39;s about logic but it
is also about the motion and that the
motion is usually your gut feeling so my
gut feeling was telling me take it so I
did because I believe that trusting your
gut feeling is trusting in the
collection of thousands of tons of micro
lessons over the course of your life
it&#39;s relying on all those subconscious
experiences the situation might not be
the same as you have experienced in the
past but it might have some patterns run
from years so being a life so I took a
deep breath and embrace my fear by
acting quickly bearing in every single
action to give us the foreword I signed
my contract I bought my laptop I will my
flight ticket I got an accountant
I got my professional insurance and it
was India so my mother said you don&#39;t go
unless you show me your international
medical insurance so yes I did moms are
always right and I thank her later right
after my first proper Indian dinner
something has been clear for me since I
was a child if we ever want to achieve
the light that we always dreamed of we
have to start taking some risk it is
absolutely necessary to take some risk
to achieve anything great in life
however many of us are scared to tell
you initially and of course with any
reason it&#39;s always something at the
stake it can be our business our money
our time our reputation our health our
partner etc which are also the very same
things that we always stand to gain well
I arrived in Mumbai and I was very much
trying to find the picture or something
close to the picture that I downloaded
from Google so I found this well this is
certainly not what I was expecting I was
in shock and all the way to the hotel I
was wondering what I had done maybe this
is not what I was looking for maybe this
is one of those moments when we know is
the right choice but we still have the
desire to take the wrong way well there
was no step back on this I had to take
full responsibility because I had I have
put all my savings and all my faith on
this one and additionally I was 10,000
miles away from home well I got ready
for my first day at work I headed to the
office and after introducing myself to
the team I realized that I was the only
foreigner female in the team I
immediately knew that was going to be
tough I was not wrong I have faced many
discouraging situations while being
there like being ironic about my
expertise in the IT sector being a
foreigner female and why not ignore in
my opinion the thing is that India is
one of the biggest capitals of the
modern world
all the major arty players are present
there cities like Bangalore is
considered to be the Silicon Valley of
India because it&#39;s the IT leading
exporter so why was I there a foreigner
female in India where the IT talent is
actually exported to the rest of the
world I was terrified I had no idea but
I also had to find out and I thought
that the reason I was there was to
master my skills in a new technical
field
this time there was something else
something really powerful well I have
gone through many situations while being
there at the beginning I was really
trying hard to get involve in my
colleagues I was trying to participate
and contribute with my opinions in
discussions but that seemed not to work
at all because I just felt that I was
cut off while talking to males they just
to raise your voice and my diminish on
its own didn&#39;t even look at me when I
was talking once I have been asked to
prepare a solution of one of the pain
points of the projects well I was happy
because I thought I was part of the team
I prepared a presentation and a demo I
was ready to show them where I had done
with through his clients the
presentation started I didn&#39;t get to the
end when my colleagues left the room I
was there waiting close to an hour they
didn&#39;t come back later it came to us
what was it about they told me they had
an important telephone call that they
could not postpone that eventually they
thought I knew about it well there were
ups and downs days when I was depressed
disappointed and really close to give up
and go back home with empty pockets god
I dislike so much that situation but
there were also good days doors with
full sunshine and positive thoughts
where I was convinced to embrace every
single situation that made me
uncomfortable
and I went through every single decision
I made wondering why I was there in a
place when I didn&#39;t feel that I was hurt
where my boys was not hurt where I
couldn&#39;t feel that I was contributing to
do something meaningful or beyond
expectations once I was having lunch
alone and I realized that I feel so much
or me so much to feel included that I
belong to a circle that was also a
problem but it was out of control I was
not able to control the situation
it is no DC to expose our feelings when
we don&#39;t know how others will react once
I cry so much over the night like my
eyes were so swollen the next day I
could barely open them I came to the
office and I saw that my staff was moved
out from the place where I was I knew
that the word has been redistributed and
I haven&#39;t told what to do by when I
haven&#39;t asked when you leave I have been
assigned to a new leader - well I
finished what I had to do I was booking
my taxi to go back to the hotel because
god I needed so much to have a good
sleep the new leader came and he
asked me what I was doing so I told him
I finish I&#39;m going home he raised his
voice on the way that he only knew had
to do it and told me front of the team
that I could not live until he told me
to do so because he was the boss well
this was a red flag for me but this time
I had a drum beating inside my head I
had to confront the situation to get a
common understanding and to be very
honest at this point in time I thought
that I didn&#39;t have anything to lose so I
came to his office to tell him that
people see interpret and evaluate things
in different ways that what might be
appropriate for them might not be
appropriate for me that I was just
concerned and I wanted to clarify the
situation because the way I felt with
them in the office could have an impact
of what I think about the company the
city and perhaps the country itself
because in the absence of better
knowledge we all tend to assume instead
of finding out what a behavior means to
others and I can allege the problem
well I openly share my concerns and only
what this happened I realize of one
powerful thing that I needed to be aware
of Who I am first that we should not
allow uncomfortable situations to limit
us we have to exercise control over our
chaotic and harsh environment and not to
be afraid to talk about what bothers us
we should not give away the power to
control and embrace discomfort in any
circumstance and when emotional
abilities have to be at hand and we
should be aware of our strengths to be
able to manage our own distressing
emotions this confrontation was a moment
when I was able to turn around the
situation from what I thought was a
total failure to a big success because I
could experience that attitude
determines the state of the world we
live in
it is the foundation of every success
and every failure in the past and in the
future attitude is what defines and
determines the way we feel about people
and situations even in those situations
where you may think that you haven&#39;t
taken the right choice some people feel
ashamed and embarrassed to admit that we
are made for better things some of us
are also scared to take the initial leap
to get what we always dreamed of
some of us might think that to have
these thoughts and feelings
my son boastful or arrogant but these
thoughts and feelings are not something
to ignore they are telling us that there
is another direction waiting for us
perhaps even a new world to discover
since the change of attitude changed
things change I did too
and one of the biggest changes I made in
my life is that since then I just
started to get used to feel
uncomfortable and feel comfortable again
because that is the sense of real
achievement and learning and I did not
only learn to acknowledge what doesn&#39;t
feel good but also to embrace it and I
didn&#39;t embrace only my professional
fears but also my personal ones only
then I was able to enjoy and appreciate
every single contrast that you can find
only in India in there has been a
watershed in my life because it made me
a different person a person who there
stretch if let me tell you three lessons
I learned that are relevant for you
number one if you ever got that punch
telling you that you already thanked you
already and take it that is the first
sign telling you that you are made for
better things whatever your experience
is it&#39;s going to be always good because
the worst that can happen is to fail and
failure is a beautiful thing because it
comes with lots of information so you
take it you use it to rediscover and
reinvent yourself because any outcome is
positive everything is about perspective
number two one of the greatest barriers
in personal development is fear of
failure
don&#39;t let it disturb you please don&#39;t
let it stop you some people fear to feel
humiliated mark discriminated etcetera
others are just afraid of simple change
others are afraid of failure and of
course nobody wants to fail but some of
us even abstain from trying in the first
place if you decide to go towards
curiosity there is going to be a lot of
uncertainty that&#39;s for sure and nobody&#39;s
saying is going to be it can be
frustrating demanding humiliating
challenging but whatever your experience
is remember what to do
in the first place with the right
attitude you can turn it around find out
why you feel that way embrace it
befriend it and enjoy the right number
three there to achieve by getting used
to discomfort while you might not like
the moment it is a guarantee of personal
growth if you don&#39;t step out of your
comfort zone from time to time you might
find out yourself tuning out much of
your life on the daily basis stepping
out of your comfort zone is one
important almost universal factor in
personal growth and in a competitive
world like this only those willing to
feel uncomfortable and taking some risk
are the ones getting the biggest rewards
because people who are to achieve
doesn&#39;t matter their area or field of
endeavor they are the ones willing to
feel uncomfortable over and over again
on the way to mastery those people know
that there will be lots of obstacles but
with the right attitude it is possible
to turn it around and overcome the
hurdle remember life is not a straight
line choices shape your destiny and
failure brings transformation there to
fail to achieve greatly thank you very
much
[Applause]
