it is a tremendous honor to be here at
the historic Florida theatre especially
when you think about who has previously
walked on this stage Ray Charles
Johnny Cash Elvis Presley BB King now we
may not be the king of rock and roll or
the king of the blues but each of us
holds the most important title in
American democracy well hang on a second
you might be saying I&#39;m not a president
or a governor or a senator or a
congressperson or a mayor well you don&#39;t
have to be because in our democracy the
most important title is that of citizen
former Illinois governor two-time
presidential candidate and United
Nations ambassador Adlai Stevenson said
it best as citizens in a democracy you
are the rulers and the ruled the law
givers and the law abiders the beginning
and the end but it&#39;s not enough to hold
the title remember the first three words
of our United States Constitution We the
People We are fortunate enough to live
in a country that is supposed to be led
by four and of the people but to make
that work we have to build and flex our
citizenship muscles to make government
respond and therein lies the challenge
most Americans don&#39;t think we can make
government respond back in 2015 the Pew
Research Center did a study of Americans
attitudes toward government they found
that 74% three-quarters of Americans no
longer believed that elected officials
care what we think
well those feelings of frustration and
alienation are perfectly understandable
when you consider what&#39;s going on in the
nation&#39;s capital in all 50 state
capitals but it&#39;s also understandable
when you think about that we realized
that we haven&#39;t been trained in the
skills needed to make elected officials
care what we think over the last several
decades civics and citizenship have
largely gone missing from the American
curriculum and when they have been
taught they&#39;ve been taught as
civics in other words what are the three
branches of government who are the
members of the cabinet how does a bill
become a law not as participatory civics
in other words how do we use our
citizenship rights and responsibilities
to move government in our direction
imagine you were teaching someone the
game of basketball would you teach them
by taking them into the locker room and
having them read books about the history
of basketball maybe have them watch some
videos of basketball or would you take
them out in the court and have them
practice passing and jump shots and
dribbling well in our democracy right
now that locker room style is the way
we&#39;re teaching civics and it&#39;s wrong
because we don&#39;t want to be in the
stands of democracy watching it happen
we want to be on the court of democracy
making it happen well today I&#39;d like to
share with you the stories of some
Americans who have been on the court
making it happen and have won and in
that process I want to help dispel some
myths and provide some truths about
effective citizenship so the first myth
not a surprising one in this hyper
partisan and polarized world in which we
live is that people can no longer work
together across partisan and ideological
lines to make a difference the truth is
that people can work together to achieve
common goals and to illustrate that
truth I&#39;d like to take you from here in
Jacksonville to Atlanta Georgia and
introduce you to two remarkable women
Debbie Dooley and Colleen Kiernan Debbie
on your left was one of the founders of
the National Tea Party Colleen on your
right was the executive director of the
Georgia Sierra Club now let&#39;s think
about that for just a second
Tea Party and Sierra Club not two groups
we would ever think would work together
on anything but when Debbie and Colleen
met in 2012 and got to know each other
they realized they had a shared passion
for making their home state of Georgia a
more solar energy friendly state so
working together and with some solar
energy advocates they formed the very
aptly named green tea coalition great
name right well that Coalition had a
major obstacle it was the large
politically influential investor owned
utility in Georgia Georgia power one of
the most powerful special interests in
the state but despite that opposition
Debbie and Colleen and their team helped
to persuade Georgia regulators to
require that Georgia Power includes
solar energy as part of their
electricity mix they helped to persuade
the Georgia Legislature to make it
easier for homeowners to put solar
devices on their homes they even changed
the culture in Georgia so much that
today Georgia Power has embraced solar
energy and is building solar generation
facilities all over the state of Florida
Debbie and Colleen were so successful
that today while Florida is the Sunshine
State in name Georgia is the Sunshine
State in fact and that&#39;s because these
two women defied conventional wisdom and
work together across partisan and
ideological lines we can do that too so
that was our first myth that I hope
we&#39;ve dispelled and I now wanted to
spell a second one and for that I&#39;d like
to travel from Atlanta Georgia to Miami
Beach Florida and that myth is the myth
that one person can&#39;t make a difference
we ever said that to yourself hey I&#39;m
just one person what can I do well as
you&#39;ll see from the case of Miami
Florida you can do a lot and perhaps
you&#39;re more familiar with Miami Beach by
its other name South Beach maybe you
watched Miami Vice in the 1980s
maybe you&#39;ve eaten a Joe&#39;s stone crab
maybe you&#39;ve tried the South Beach diet
I know I have or maybe you know South
Beach because of its very visually
distinctive Art Deco buildings
well those Art Deco buildings are still
there today because one person stood up
and made a difference so let me set the
scene for you
it&#39;s the mid to late 1970s and Disney
World has just moved to Florida several
years ago communities like Miami Beach
are trying to amp up their own tourism
economies and so developers and some
other leaders in Miami Beach have
decided that the way for them to do that
is to redevelop parts of South Beach and
dismantle some of those historic Art
Deco buildings well one person was
having none of that and her name was
Barbara kappahd man Barbara was a
recently widowed historic
preservationist who was passionate about
these Art Deco structures well Barbara
worked skillfully and ingeniously at
every level of government to protect
these buildings she helped to elect pro
preservation elected officials at the
city of Miami Beach she worked with the
state of Florida historic preservation
officer to gain their support for her
efforts and most notably
she got South Beach listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
Barbara was so successful that today 40
years later those historic buildings
still stand now lovingly watched over by
Barbara&#39;s monument and protected by the
organization that she worked hard to
create the Miami design preservation
league those buildings are there today
because one person stood up and made a
difference and all of us can do that as
well so the last point I&#39;d like to make
now that we&#39;ve hopefully dispelled those
two myths is to talk about one important
truth of citizen engagement and that&#39;s
this when our moment comes for effective
citizenship we have to reach out and
seize it
to make government respond and to help
show how possible that is I&#39;d like to
make one last Geographic
shipped this time going from Miami Beach
to Columbia Missouri to the campus of
the University of Missouri let&#39;s set the
scene again it&#39;s the fall of 2015
November 2015 to be precise and four
weeks students have been expressing
concerns about racism on campus and
they&#39;re frustrated because those
concerns have not been addressed as
quickly as the students felt like the
administration should have well one
group of students saw their moment and
step forward to build and flex their
citizenship muscles and that was the
two-time defending FEC East football
champion Missouri Tigers again it was
November 2015 and at the end of that
week they were scheduled to play in a
very important neutral site game against
Brigham Young University in Kansas City
Missouri and that game wasn&#39;t just
important for their record it was also
important because it was going to
generate significant revenue for the
University of Missouri 1 million dollars
well several days before the game some
of the University of Missouri players
announced that unless those student
concerns about racism were addressed and
the university president resigned they
were not going to play in that upcoming
neutral site game their teammates back
them up their coaches backed them up and
shortly thereafter the University of
Missouri president resigned
that is an example of what we&#39;re capable
of when we seize the moment for civic
engagement all of us can do that and so
when we leave here today we have a
choice we can be one of the seventy four
percent of Americans who believe that
elected officials no longer care what we
think and do nothing or or we can be a
Debbie or a Colleen or a Barbara or a
University of Missouri tiger and we can
use the skills of effective citizenship
to make them care well how do we start
where does this process begin well first
it begins with the realization that even
one person can make a difference Barbara
taught us that anyone can leave here
today and be an effective citizen and to
do that the first step is to identify or
define a problem in your community or
neighborhood challenges are all around
us maybe you want to clean up your local
park or increase funding for technology
in your child&#39;s school and once you&#39;ve
defined that problem set a meeting with
the local official who can help you
solve it perhaps that local officials a
school board member a city council
member a county commissioner a state
legislature but meet with them and
persuade them as to the rightness of
your cause and if you can&#39;t persuade
them find allies who can remember the
story of Debbie and Colleen allies can
be found in the least likely of places
and don&#39;t forget throughout this process
the most fundamental truth of American
democracy in this country we the people
rule we can and must build and flex our
citizenship muscles to make government
listen care and act thank you very much
[Applause]
