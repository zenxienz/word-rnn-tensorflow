as the slide says there are people in
the world
oh sorry if I&#39;m not standing on the red
dot just notice that there are people in
the world who if they&#39;re telling your
story need to tell you 19 other stories
first before they can get to the point
I&#39;m one of those people I want to tell
you a story about a conversation I
witnessed at a mosque which changed my
life but to tell you that story I have
to tell you another story first and I&#39;ve
only got 12 minutes and that story
starts in late May early June of this
year I got the opportunity to go on a
trip to the United States with a
delegation from arriving the UK I was
the only one from Northern Ireland and
we were going there to learn about
American values we were gonna be
traveling across Washington Florida and
taxes meeting with everyone from guns
rights lobbyists to religious leaders
and LGBT groups people who span the
spectrum of American values so the thing
about these trips is that they offer you
a number of perks right they offer you
carrots they could dangle in front of
you whenever the going gets tough when
you&#39;re in no one-hundredths meeting of
the day with someone whose views you
find absolutely reprehensible and you&#39;re
really struggling to stay the course so
in our case they took us to Disneyland
which I can confirm is definitely one of
the happiest places on earth I was in my
element damn they took us to NASA which
as a Star Wars nerd I have to say
competed and my heart for the title of
happiest place on earth
someone very helpfully pointed out to me
because I was posting selfies of myself
at that time long ago in Florida and
vast hops and someone very helpfully
pointed out that I seem to have more
vests and rabb seen as but
I know the theme of the conference&#39;s
bridges I felt like burnin got one to be
quite frank and then we got to go to
this beautiful beachside resort called
Cocoa Beach and sip cocktails on the
beach it was absolutely wonderful and
you&#39;re probably thinking where do I sign
up for this trip the signs of music it&#39;s
a free Jolley which was that I thought
it was when I looked at the itinerary
but I had to go through hell to get
these perks I realized that really the
Disneyland of mass at the deal with
these were all carrots they were
dangling in front of us whenever I find
myself less than 10 feet away from the
chief orangutan in the White House el
Trump people ask me what&#39;s the hardest
thing about standing 10 feet away from
Donald Trump I think it was seeing how
badly his vehicon was applied the next
part of the trip
oh I did redeem my conscience when I got
to Florida I should say and we got these
lovely protesters who in case you can&#39;t
see you&#39;re holding a stop Trump sign and
they were right up my alley I thought
they were fantastic our next visit was
the place called the National Rifle
Association though the gold rates
lobbyists who come white in the wake of
every mass shooting and defend the right
of Americans to bear arms and for a
number of people in the group this was
the most difficult part of the trip they
find it very difficult to sit there and
listen and exchange views which was what
the whole trip was a fight bite excuse
me for me though the hardest part of the
trip was when we got the Orlando and
they told us we were gonna be visiting a
mosque you asked yourself why would I
find it hard to visit a mosque well for
those of you who don&#39;t have gaydar I&#39;m
gay and don&#39;t are you gonna ask okay
and I hear that myself for much of my
life because of what religion taught me
about people like me and when I stopped
hearing myself I started hearing
religion but I was intrigued by this
mosque because it was an Orlando and a
geared of the week that we were in
Orlando 49 gay people were slaughtered
so I forty nine people were slaughtered
and a gay nightclub called pulse and
this mosque Adelaide the response to
that tragedy as it condemned it I was
intrigued by that this was at a time
when Christian churches in Orlando were
refusing to burry some of the dead
because they were gay so they have a
church come right and our mosque
inviting condemned this was a big deal
one of the victims of pulse had always
stuck with me was Brandon marques McCool
she was alone when he was eight with her
gay son that latent pulse supporting him
and when the gunman released his bullets
she threw herself in front of her son
and he survived but she didn&#39;t so I
decided that I would go into this mosque
with an open mind I did and we met with
this lovely man called Bassam it was one
of the leaders in the mosque and we
talked about everything and eventually
passive and I had a conversation about
LGBT rights and what Muslims think of
gay people and difficult thorny subject
but we had a really pleasant
conversation but he never knew what was
about to happen next there was a young
man on our trip they all called Mahmood
young Muslim man and he was listening to
the exchange between passive and I and
when we finished talking he spoke up in
a dress Bassam and he said my best
friend was gay he was Muslim and he
committed suicide and at this point
Mahmud burst into tears and he said I
did everything I could to save him but I
couldn&#39;t and he told us the story of how
this young Muslim man couldn&#39;t live with
being Muslim and being gay he felt that
the only option he had was die by
suicide
we were all crying in the markets I
think by that point we&#39;re all morning
for this young Muslim man that we never
met and I that we would never get the
chance to meet you know when I left
religious education at 16 I swore that I
was done with religion and I was never
going back to it and I was never gonna
have another conversation that I
couldn&#39;t help with another person of
theistic Ian when I was in that mosque
at day and I was there in the heart
about American values so the hands are
getting schooled on my own culture I am
Muslim because what I realized was that
I couldn&#39;t run away from religion
anymore within the LGBT community we
have a saying that we tell people we
tell them it gets better and what I
realized that day was that it gets
better for some of us it gets better for
those of us who live long enough to see
it get better I realized that I couldn&#39;t
run away from religion anymore because
religion ships high LGBT people are
treated in the world it ships the laws
and how they treat LGBT people which we
can see from the lack of equal marriage
in this country and it ships high we
LGBT people feel about ourselves the
first lesson I learned about being gay
was that it was evil and that I was
going to hell for it and I learned that
from the Bible
there were times that I would cry in my
bedroom as a teenager Bartling with God
asking him not to send me to hell
because I was so convinced that I was
going there you this taxes Bible I know
for so many people it offers them hope
and it offers some salvation but for me
and offered a prison sentence and I
think it&#39;s aciem for a lot of other LGBT
young people LGBT suicide rates are
through the roof this is the percentage
of trials Rhys alone in the UK who have
attempted suicide in the last in the
over the course of the last year I&#39;m
before we see these numbers play out in
Northern Ireland locally and we know
this from challenged with services who
say they see a player among their young
people
what do we do about this I feel the only
answer is the change religious teaching
on homosexuality and LGBT issues and I
don&#39;t mean we buried Christians and
shout at them or berate Muslims and
shout at them we need to do the one
thing that I didn&#39;t want to do and I
left at school at 16 we need to have
conversations difficult conversations
and fight for the hearts and minds of
those who oppose us I&#39;ve studied this
and when you ask people like megan
phelps roper he was one of the member of
the Westboro Baptist Church a hate group
in America when he asked people like
this when you ask former neo-nazis the
most extreme people when you ask them
what changed your mind
what means you about in your views
they&#39;ll tell you the same thing it was a
conversation someone who they were
opposed to struck up a conversation and
they learned that that person was not
who they thought they were they got the
point where they could no longer hold
those views people tell me this isn&#39;t
gonna happen there is no way the
churches will change their teaching or
the mosques will change their teachings
you&#39;re mad and I would have agreed with
them but six weeks ago I was out in the
gay bar not this one
with my friend Jordan he was a free from
a free presbyterian DP Fulton family in
County legendary Boyd that londonderry
Gary thing I hear thoughts I&#39;m we were
right there with his mom two years a
Scottish free P who goes to church every
Sunday and she was out in this bar
supporting her case on just like Brenda
and marques McCool was like impulse at
night supporting her case on don&#39;t tell
me there&#39;s no hope because for too many
LGBT young people that is the only thing
they have that keeps them living and by
the way that free presbyterian mother
went in the works the next day and told
everyone that right this amazing thing
she&#39;d been too called a drag show
nine
if you had told me that I&#39;d be sitting
in a gay bar with one of the impious
these disciples drinking cocktails and
watching a drag show I told you you were
mad so what can you do if you thought
you&#39;re here to see listen passively to
me rant on no I&#39;ve got a job for you if
any of you are uncomfortable with the
thought of someone like me please come
up to me after this event and talk to me
I won&#39;t bite your head off I won&#39;t call
you homophobe we&#39;ll just have a
conversation and I&#39;ll show you that I&#39;m
human just like you if you are
comfortable with the thought of someone
like me have a conversation with someone
who hasn&#39;t and try to change their mind
because you could be saving a life
finally I&#39;d like to send a message to
all LGBTQ young people are currently
struggling especially those from faith
backgrounds for I knew the plans I have
for you declares the Lord plans to
prosper you and not to harm you plans to
give you hope and a future

Jeremiah 29:11 this talk is in memory of
the pulse 49 and all LGBT people who
died by suicide thank you very much
