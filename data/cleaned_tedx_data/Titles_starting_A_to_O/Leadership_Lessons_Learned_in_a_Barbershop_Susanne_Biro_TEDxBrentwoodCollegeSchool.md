thank you I&#39;m so excited to be here my
mother had a barber shop in West
Vancouver British Columbia Canada and
when I was 17 years old she insisted
just as her father had done with her
that I learned the family trade now
here&#39;s the thing nothing to me wanted to
be a barber and at the age of 17 I
dreamed of doing something that felt so
much more glamorous than working with my
family
and my mother&#39;s barbershop but my mother
countered that having a trade was very
important so I would learn it just in
case now just in case was afraid she
used a lot you see my mother immigrated
from Europe to Canada in 1966 and she
wasn&#39;t certain that my education was
going to result in the job as I was
gonna be the first member of my entire
family to attend university so just in
case my schooling didn&#39;t work out I
could always go back to barbering and
according to my mother if a war ever
broke out people would still always need
their hair cut so I would always have a
job than to just in case so it was
decided that to put myself through
school I would work in my mother&#39;s
barber shop with my grandfather and my
older sister Sharon now I love my family
dearly but the truth is I hated it
see there&#39;s a reason I&#39;m not in this
picture smiling with the three of them I
had no interest in hair the particular
angle that you need to hold it in and
cut it out in order to create a
particular shape so needless to say it
was not a good barber and not near
nowhere near the master that these three
were now because I didn&#39;t want to be a
barber I had no interest or desire to
master the skills I became increasingly
focused on the men who came into my
mother&#39;s barber shop and sat in my chair
I mean what could I offer them aside
from a great haircut that would make
them want to come back to me and what
would make them tell their friends and
family about me and what would make them
loyal to me their barber now these are
customer service questions that I was
asking myself but they&#39;re also really
critically important leadership
questions see if you hold a leadership
position why should the highly talented
men and women who report to you today
continue to report to tomorrow
and why should they authorize you and
your leadership and give you their
discretionary effort and what would make
them loyal to you their leader now at my
mother&#39;s barber shop I had about half an
hour with each client so half an hour of
one-on-one exclusive time and since
haircut quality was not going to be my
forte
I began time to see if I could make the
time the client spent with me some of
the best parts of their day and so back
then I reasoned well I could be the
barber with whom people really love to
talk the one who just generally saw them
and listen to them and cared about them
as people now many of the men who came
into my mother&#39;s shop were highly
respected professionals who worked
downtown
however originally I didn&#39;t know who any
of them were what any of them did and so
I simply treated each the same each was
a person a fellow human being who I
started to recognize was tired from the
many pressures and demands he felt
placed upon him and I watched as many
were desperately trying to balance their
personal professional lives so the time
they had with me I realized was likely
the only time when they could just sit
and do nothing there was a time when
well one they actually did really need
to sit and do nothing in that move
because I was actually known to cut ears
as well as hair but it was a time when
they weren&#39;t forced to play one of their
many roles because I had no idea if the
client was a Supreme Court judge or the
president of a multi-million dollar
company to me at the age of 17 they were
just jack
Sully Martin and so I spoke to each of
them with honesty candor challenging
them bantering with them and through the
process creating outstanding
relationships
I remember one client really well and
I&#39;ll call him al when al first came in
he said please don&#39;t trim anything off
the top I looked at al I said al you you
don&#39;t have a top it&#39;s it&#39;s called a
comb-over do you want me not to trim the
side and he&#39;d laugh and I&#39;d laugh and
he&#39;d say yeah nothing off the side now
years later I would learn that ours
really high up in our judicial system
and so when he next came into
shop I said only oh you&#39;re kind of a
really big deal and he&#39;d say I know and
I&#39;d say still nothing off the side and
he&#39;d say yeah nothing off the side and
what happened was my clients were no
longer just clients they became friends
I believe we were simply two people I
didn&#39;t respect for one another and
here&#39;s what I learned more than anything
else what we all want is for other
people to generally see us and care
about us to tell us the truth to
challenge us and to stop seeing this as
our predetermined roles whether it be
CEO or barber and to start seeing us as
people with the potential for greater
human connection and greater
accomplishment and achievement
regardless of what we may or may not
have accomplished in our life thus far
and the key word here is care when we
believe another person generally cares
about us and our ultimate success and
fulfillment we will grant that person
concessions we won&#39;t grant others see I
was probably the worst barber and my
mother&#39;s shop actually and quite certain
I was but I soon attracted my own
following
I mean clients would come in and wait
hours for me or come back another day if
I was too busy and at Christmas time
they brought me gifts some even left me
hundred dollar tips why why would they
do this because these men knew that I
loved them they knew that I cared about
them and because of that I would have a
conversation that needed to be had I
wasn&#39;t easily impressed with their
positions of power their perceived
wealth I would challenge them banter
with them require that they live up to
their own highest vision and values for
their life and through the process make
some of the time they spent with me some
of the best parts of their day and the
payback for me was awesome I began to
love my work I mean my days became
filled with the most incredible men who
shared with me their successes their
failures their passions their
frustrations their awesome humor and
their credible sadness and grief as I
watch them buried loved ones over the
years but we shared life together once a
month when they came to visit and isn&#39;t
that what we&#39;re all here doing anyways
you where is it that we think we&#39;re
going see not one of us gets out of this
human experience alive and so perhaps
we&#39;re here as ROM das has said to simply
help walk each other home see what is
leadership if not the ability to work
extraordinary and through other people
regardless of who reports to whom and as
such our main tacit then is to treat
other people in such a way that they
want to bring all their unique gifts
talents the discretionary effort forward
to achieve a goal the collective goal of
the business and so it is the each of us
must master the art of effectively
interacting with other people
in order to get anything done this above
all else I believe is the real
leadership challenge over the last 16
years I&#39;ve had the incredible good
fortune to coach thousands of senior
level leaders in some of the world&#39;s
best companies and I know that the time
I spent working my mother&#39;s barbershop
taught me more about how to do that well
than perhaps all 10 years of my
post-secondary formal education what I
know is that every job on our path is
important because each one teaches us
more about people and more effectively
connect engage and build trusts and
these are all things necessary because
we can do nothing significant alone I
see so many people today eager to get
somewhere and become someone but then I
watch them and I watched myself included
rushed past the only leadership moment
that ever exists which is this moment
right here was the person in the
situation right in front of us and I
think one of the reasons we do this is
perhaps were waiting on what we deemed
to be a more important person to arrive
or for the moment of leadership to feel
more glamorous than it actually ever
does feel but the moment of leadership
is always this moment right here with
the person situation right in front of
us because how we do anything is how we
will do everything
several years ago I was brought in to
work with a number of senior biotech
leaders in San Francisco and on the
morning the work was to begin I was
waiting in the designated
office where each leader was gonna meet
with me for their one-on-one coaching
session that particular morning my first
client arrived late came in rather
abruptly stood over me and said look I
don&#39;t know how much my company&#39;s paying
you but you&#39;re 45 minutes and this
better be good
I stood up say good morning my name is
Suzanne that&#39;s um it&#39;s that tended to
see a way to introduce yourself to
someone come on in sit down let&#39;s talk
and so we did we talked a little bit
about what had occurred for him earlier
that morning that led to his current
emotional state and I asked him if he
approached other individuals in a
similar fashion to how he had approached
me that morning and he said they did
with some groups of people but not with
others I shared a little bit about the
impact his behavior had on me and how I
thought that was relevant for his
greatest effectiveness and success and
then we discussed alternative ways he
might have handled himself that
particular morning after about an hour
we stood up shook hands said goodbye
the next day I received a very
thoughtful email from him to say this
thank you for seeing me and for the
insight into my behavior few have ever
called me out on it I&#39;ll be taking some
of your advice but here&#39;s the thing I
never gave him any advice I simply share
the impact his behavior had on me and
asked him if he thought it was effective
so the advice he was referring to was
his own advice to himself see we all
know we can be better and higher
versions of ourselves but I don&#39;t know a
single human being who can live that
consistently perfectly every day I don&#39;t
know if you&#39;ve noticed but it&#39;s really
hard to be human and it&#39;s hard to be a
good human and perhaps even more
challenging is to be an exceptional
senior level leader in our world today I
mean we are living through an
unprecedented time of technological
advancement globalization and the amount
of information that comes in each of us
is absolutely relentless so perhaps were
meant to be more kind
passionate to our fellow human travelers
so why do you your next interaction is
the moment of leadership the only
leadership moment that ever exists and
what if the job you have right now is
the very best place for you to learn
more about people and therefore business
and what if each of us as we interacted
with other people in the moment that we
interacted with them just generally
cared about them and their ultimate
success I wonder what would be possible
now over the last 13 years the
leadership circle organization has
tracked the effectiveness of more than
60,000 c-suite and senior level leaders
in more than 10,000 organizations and in
171 countries what they have found is
those leaders who lead with integrity
was courageous authenticity was a caring
connection to other people and a concern
for their community outperform in a
concrete business sense those leaders
who do not now when I discovered this
body of research I was personally over
the moon because I&#39;ve always wanted to
believe that doing the right thing and
doing right by people matters and now
there&#39;s research to prove that it does
that love wins but only always so just
in case leadership really is nothing
other than the ability to work extremely
well with and through other people the
people in your life right now in just in
case what you do really matters that you
are that powerful but the words you say
the thoughts you think the actions you
take they have the power to make or
break another person&#39;s day lead with
kindness compassion and love and from
that may you sense the incredible power
that you have to set the tone of every
relationship you&#39;re a part of and from
that have the greatest potential to
create the kind of world we all want to
live in lead with love as if it was a
concrete business imperative and your
greatest professional competitive
advantage just in case it is thank you
you
