so I&#39;ve got this drawer full of socks
that I just happened to carry around
with me and so you never know when
you&#39;re gonna need some socks right so
imagine this I need a pair of socks and
I need them to match but I&#39;m not going
to let myself look in the drawer so
think for yourself how many pulls will
it be before I&#39;m guaranteed to get a
pair okay so the first one&#39;s black and
the second one happens to be white this
time I&#39;m sure enough I did not get a
pair but on my third pull I have a black
one so what sort of thinking is this
well picture for yourself an empty box
the first box it&#39;s kind of like a
pigeonhole or an empty space so into the
first box you must put white or black
and in the second box you must put white
or black so in the third box you are
guaranteed to have a pair
so that&#39;s mathematical thinking and
indeed that problem comes to us from
from Martin Gardner who wrote thousands
of those for Scientific American and in
his books and so he believed that all of
us should have the pleasure of playing
with big and powerful mathematical ideas
and I believe that too and that&#39;s what
I&#39;m here to talk about so I just
happened to also be carrying around
jumbo oversized novelty dice and
actually I also have green ones but
today I have these black ones and you
know if you&#39;ve ever played any board
games for any length of time you
probably have a certain intuition that
at seven that is a total of seven comes
up a lot and that&#39;s kind of like the
easy outcome for a lot of different
games and you might have the sense also
that two and twelve don&#39;t tend to come
up a lot I&#39;ll say this seven doesn&#39;t get
you out of jail in monopoly okay this
time
[Music]
and it comes up eight so I didn&#39;t get
seven but imagine for yourself a bar
graph with all the possible outcomes so
- all the way up to seven which indeed
incurs the most occurs the most all the
way back down to twelve it&#39;s very
symmetrical so they&#39;re most possible
outcomes that can make seven and so I
think that&#39;s something really
interesting to talk about and it
involves mathematical thinking and it&#39;s
in our play so what do I believe for
kids I think that kids and adults should
have should all feel the power and
pleasure of playing with their
mathematics I mean think about it
math should be a thinking tool and not
just a subject in school and it should
give us pleasure
so we&#39;re humans we&#39;re thinking beings
were born to think and we&#39;re born to
play so I want a pedagogy of mathematics
where kids say this is surprising and
it&#39;s wonderful and it fills me with joy
and it&#39;s awe-inspiring so the exact
opposite of which some of you may have
experienced hopefully not too many and
it leaves me this with this sense of
wonder at just how just how amazing it
actually is that&#39;s what I want for all
of us and then so what do kids say if
you have any kids you might want to ask
them this question later and kids say
interesting things when you do ask them
Melissa Penner and students in Brampton
in grade three said this they said all
of these things so sure enough they said
math as fractions and time and and math
is cookies because for grade three
there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of cookie math and
a lot of problems about cookies right so
time money fractions is also important
but you&#39;ll notice most of all that they
said that math is fun and we want that
for all kids you know and then think for
yourself what is mathematics really
because you make just have experienced
it in school
so you we might come to definitions like
it&#39;s the science of patterns and that
works depending on the type of
mathematician you are the science of
shapes base quantity and arrangements
that works depending what kind of
mathematician you are but we want to
know what what
kids say so kids are born to wonder and
and this is our human birthright because
we&#39;re thinking beings and we&#39;re just
born into this unending stream of
consciousness from birth till death
that&#39;s what I say and these two who
happen to be my sons are always
wondering so their their life is a
constant state of wonderment from birth
on and why should that&#39;s ever stopped at
the door of math class which has some of
the most big massive world-changing and
surprising ideas so thinking about this
arrangement of deck of a deck of cards
so this deck happens to be brand new so
it&#39;s perfectly ordered so and it&#39;ll
never be more perfectly ordered so the
ace of spades is actually on the bottom
and so every time I shuffle it and deal
it out from here it&#39;s going to be in a
different arrangement so let&#39;s think
about that they didn&#39;t fly as far as I
wanted so some of them are still in
order but if you were to perfectly
shuffle them like with a shuffling
machine and deal them out again there&#39;s
a decent chance that that arrangement
has never happened on this planet can
all the recreational poker games all the
games of Go Fish and so on so picture
for yourself the same visualization tool
just make it an empty box this time and
so we could place any one of 52 cards in
that empty box
that leaves 51 to go and 50 and so on
all the way down to the last card well
because the counting principle has us
multiply we can multiply 52 times 51 and
times 50 and so on and all of a sudden
there&#39;s more possible arrangements of
that deck than there are atoms in the in
the universe and that&#39;s absolutely
astounding you could not duplicate that
flip of a deck of cards if you tried and
I think that&#39;s an idea worth playing
with and speaking of really really large
numbers have you ever asked a kid what&#39;s
the biggest number you know and so when
they&#39;re little they might just say five
okay because they&#39;ve learned one too
many one two and many so they might know
five cookies or five blocks later we&#39;ll
say a hundred and then they&#39;ll get this
of a million and then there&#39;ll always be
some kid who&#39;s just heard of infinity
because it&#39;s out there and I&#39;ll say
infinity and then some kid will say oh
yeah the biggest number I know is
infinity and one this is the sort of
thing the kids love to talk about they
just love it and so we are accounting
beings and this is my son counting I
said we&#39;re counting beings because kids
love to count they love to count and
they know it but it&#39;s this concept of
infinity that disrupts our idea of what
counting actually is right so what&#39;s in
a set so what is infinity dr. Eugenia
Chiang and her great book beyond
infinity says infinity goes on forever
infinity is bigger than any number
infinity is bigger than anything we can
think of and if you add one to it it&#39;s
still infinity so all of a sudden our
sense of one two three and so on it&#39;s
completely broken and indeed arithmetic
breaks when we work with infinity but
kids want to know about this sort of
thing and it belongs in classrooms so
Jennifer Santos who also is grade sevens
said infinity is indescribable
it&#39;s just the idea of a number and so
therefore they figured this out okay
that you subtract one it&#39;s still going
to be infinity and in my experience kids
want to know about these sorts of things
and so I wanted no limits mathematics
for kids so if we think about it if we
define our imagination as having no
limits then probably it is limitless
what we can do with mathematics and
indeed the mathematical world it&#39;s I&#39;ve
just read so much about recently there
are so many more things interesting
things than they ever taught us in
school I want that for kids and so after
15 years of teaching mathematics I&#39;m
just thinking about what are my actual
pedagogical principles and I think first
of all we&#39;ve got to know the curriculum
even more importantly know the big ideas
of the math
second of all just give kids interesting
tasks and let them play give kids
interesting mathematics to play with let
them play let them talk and think and
conjecture and wonder let them play
and so dr. Cathy Bruce defines a
pedagogy of playful mathematics as a
kind of guided play with teachers
guiding children through the big and
powerful ideas of mathematics and I
think we can have that in our classrooms
so for me a pedagogy of playful
mathematics is all about kids talking
about interesting things it is kids
talking about talking to each other and
making conjectures about things like
infinity it is kids playing with numbers
it is kids using mathematical thinking
to break things down to their their
basic level so dr. Frances sue says and
is absolutely astounding talk called
mathematics for human flourishing which
he gave is outgoing president of the
mathematical Association of America well
he says he situates play as one of five
basic human needs and he says that play
gives hope play builds hope and so if we
define mathematics as a playful endeavor
if we say mathematics is play then it
should follow that math gives hope as
well and indeed this talk was about an
inmate who used mathematics to better
himself so literally was able to build
mathematical worlds for himself to
escape confinement all the bars and
barbed wire and later to make a career
when he was no longer incarcerated but
kids know all about play ok it&#39;s us who
forgotten or maybe some of us have so we
go to work and there&#39;s going to be 4200
emails
22 of them have that exclamation point
beside that means you must read me now
there&#39;s three meetings happening your
boss wants something you need to get
your car into the shop for its oil
change and their swimming lessons and so
on
but kids know so try interrupting them
when they&#39;re then when they&#39;re in this
deep state of play if they&#39;re like my
children they forget to eat even can go
to the bathroom sometimes which is a
problem but this could be making
something with Lego making something
with Lego or playing with stuffed
animals or creating a world with action
figures or just playing in that bush
that&#39;s beside your house they don&#39;t want
to stop so they&#39;re in this deep state of
flow what the Hungarian psychologist
Sushma Haile calls flow where you&#39;re
beyond time time seems to disappear and
you&#39;re just doing it and you&#39;re deriving
so much pleasure from it everything
disappears the worlds out the world
outside and think about for us when do
we get into that state of flow and so
what I&#39;m feeling right now is that we do
need to just play for the parents out
there we need to play board games dice
games with our kids card games we can do
all the spatial things like Lego and
blocks find the math in the world around
us when we&#39;re shopping it&#39;s there for us
to find play with it and for the adults
who maybe don&#39;t have kids there&#39;s so
much out there now let&#39;s find a book by
olives Alex bellos for example who
writes for The Guardian or a book by
Martin Gardner and let&#39;s find some
interesting math to play with and let&#39;s
teach herself to think mathematically
remember I said mathematics is a
thinking tool not just something that
you learn in school and we should all
play with the big and powerful ideas of
mathematics and I&#39;m actually going to
leave you with this the penny toss is
guaranteed not to fail like the card
toss did that may have made some point
about probability but it wasn&#39;t the
point I wanted to make but so I&#39;m now if
I can I&#39;ve just notated heads with an H
and if I toss this and if I land in a
configuration where I&#39;m able to gather
up 20 heads but I&#39;m prepared to pay
$1,000,000 to everyone in this audience
okay that&#39;s the heads it&#39;s the maple
leaf and you know what I&#39;m not even
gonna say I got lucky cuz I knew I
wasn&#39;t paying off on that bed and you
could think about how I knew that
so in summary let us play with the big
and powerful ideas of mathematics thank
you very much
[Applause]
