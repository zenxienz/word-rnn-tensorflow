can I ask you something are you worried
about the future think about the last
time that you watch the nine o&#39;clock
news on TV did you see anything that
made you feel good about yourself made
you feel safe gave you those happy
feelings in your stomach because if you
did I love to learn which channel you
were watching because the last time I
watched the nine o&#39;clock news all I
could do was worry all that violence
that sexism that racism that hate does
it not upset you I&#39;m going to show you
some statistics and it&#39;s going to make
you feel worse just last year reported
grave crimes increased by ten percent in
Sri Lanka and crimes against women
increased by nine percent two out of
every three Sri Lankan women of victims
of either sexual or physical violence
just imagine this out of every three
women that you know two of them are or
will become victims of violence globally
these figures even worse 1.6 million
people die every year due to violence
this city of Colombo has roughly 600,000
people as almost 3 times the population
of this city gets wiped out due to
violence every year and a quarter of all
children are abused just in this
auditorium it&#39;s possible that about 300
of you were abused as a child so what do
we do about this well for generations
Society has thought that we can solve
most of these problems through the law
trust me
I&#39;m a lawyer I know I may not look like
one right now but I am and as lawyers we
think we can solve everything through
the law I mean don&#39;t get me wrong
the law is great it gives me business
but
can we solve all our problems through
this I don&#39;t think so but how about if I
told you that within a generation we
could have a society that was more just
was more fair and had better chances of
peace what if I told you that within 15
years we could have an entire new
generation of young people that would
have more empathy be more compassionate
and kind they would be able to think
critically and sit around the table and
solve their problems peacefully they
would think better than you or me
they would think equal now what if I
told you that we are creating this
generation right now so how are we doing
it simple it&#39;s called education not just
any type of education but social and
emotional intelligence what does that
mean that means teaching children basic
values just such as to have empathy to
be kind to one another to believe in
equality to teach them skills such as to
think critically to solve problems
peacefully and to have some self
regulation you see a present education
system is structured on the needs of the
19th century Industrial Revolution we
taught maths the taught science we
taught literature can I ask you
something in are we ever taught to be
human beings and this is what social and
emotional learning does it teaches
children to be human beings so when I
initiative is nothing more than idea
hatched up in the kitchen of our founder
Leslie Ardoin we want to create
something that would have a positive
lasting impact in this world we were
sort of tired of paper promising change
but never really delivering it you were
tired of people trying to find a
solution to violence but never really
finding it you see if we are going to
see a systemic generational change in
how things are done in this world then
we have to change mindsets and we can
only change mindsets through education
so where do we start well the answer
actually lies in neuroscience so
neuroscience tells us that about 75% of
a child&#39;s brain development takes place
between the ages of 3 to 7 now this is a
period of the optimal cognitive modify
ability of a child what does that mean
that means that it is during this period
that a child&#39;s personality world views
and value system is being formed so
neuroscience actually tells us that if
we want to have a more enlightened human
being but this is where we should start
therefore this is where we did now if
there&#39;s many studies out there which
shows the credible benefits of
social-emotional learning from the
earlier so children now one such study
was supported by the US Department of
Education and what they did was they
sort of created a five-point scale to
test the social competency of children
and they monitored these children from
the time they were in kindergarten for
20 whole years now what this study found
out at the end of this 20-year period
was there for every one point increase
in a child social competency that that
child was twice as likely to get a
university degree
54% more likely to actually finish
school and 46 percent more likely to
have a full-time job by the time of 25
it also found out that every one point
decrease in their social competency that
that child would have a 67 percent
higher chance of actually getting
arrested in early childhood in sorry in
early adulthood and had a 82 percent
higher chance of consuming illegal
substances so with all this incredible
research out there which showed the
wonderful benefits of actually teaching
children social-emotional learning from
an early stage what really surprised us
when we started this initiative was that
we actually couldn&#39;t find a single
concrete curriculum that actually taught
it so what do we do well we decided to
create it ourselves
so we reached out to Montessori we
reached out to the University of year we
reached out to child psychologists and
neuroscientists we brought them all
together and we created the world&#39;s
first curriculum which will teach
children social and emotional learning
today the thing equal subject is ding
piloted across schools in 18 countries
around the world our subject is
structured so that children actually
learn these values and skills through
experience you can never teach a child
by standing in front of a blackboard and
telling the child to be more empathetic
to think critically that isn&#39;t work
children love to learn through methods
which they enjoy so we use play we use
narrative we use stories news games and
the results that are coming out of it
are just incredible so now you must be
thinking why is this lawyer sitting
standing here on this stage in Sri Lanka
and sharing the story about this
education program
well that&#39;s because this country that&#39;s
right your country and my country became
the first country in the world to
actually begin piloting this program
from January this year and it will
become the first country in the world
that will roll it out across all their
schools from next year so why did we
choose Sri Lanka to be the first thing
equal country sadly my story isn&#39;t very
unique you see I was born in 1984 one
year after Sri Lanka civil war started
my whole life just like most of yours
all I knew was war a war that was a
result of our inability to treat others
with respect and with equality the war
which was the result of our lack of
empathy for the lives and values of
another human being he was just a
generation of lost opportunity you were
never leaders in anything at best we
were followers but most of the time we
were told that we weren&#39;t good enough
but with this subject you gave me hope
here was our chance for Sri Lanka to
leading something in education setting
the stage for the rest of the world
and more importantly for me it was a
chance to set a foundation for a lasting
and durable peace so that the next
generation does not have to go through
what our generation did and the stories
coming out of Sri Lanka are just truly
incredible now a few weeks after we
actually started piloting this subject I
had a missed call on my phone it was

Friday night it was 10:00 p.m. and it
was from one of the teachers of a pilot
that was piloting this subject so I
called her back and I said hi I&#39;m sorry
I missed your call and she said I worry
the great timing I meet six other
teachers piloting this subject and I was

like you know it&#39;s 10:00 p.m. on a
Friday night is everything okay
and she said yes everything&#39;s great
the results have been so incredible that
they&#39;ve actually come together to sort
of form a support group to share their
stories so what she did was she passed
the fall from teacher to teacher and
each one of them shared a story with me
and I&#39;m going to share two with you the
first is about the girl with the mirror
now this girl she&#39;s three and a half
years old and for the last two years she
had been covered in a rash they&#39;ve been
going to the doctor for two years and
none of the medicine has been working
her condition was so bad that her
teachers tell me that they had to clean
her every five to ten minutes because of
the passed in the blood that was coming
from her wounds she was ostracized in
class she didn&#39;t really have that many
friends her parents thought that she was
possessed by an evil spirit and they
also thought the house was cursed and
they&#39;re going to move home and take out
of the school now the first week&#39;s
lessons are called what I like about me
is to teach
children to accept themselves to
appreciate themselves and through that
to accept and appreciate others now at
the end of this week&#39;s lessons each
child in the class has to take a mirror
and they look at the mirror and they
have to share with their with their
other friends what they like about
themselves now the teachers tell me that
this girl she would never look at
herself in the mirror because she was so
conscious of her condition
but in this instance she looked at
herself in the mirror and she told
everyone else in the class I like my
face this was the first time she had
said anything positive about herself
now that weekend her mother saw her
daughter looking at a full-length mirror
at home and saw her looking at her hands
his hands covered in this rash she was
looking at it and she was talking to
herself and she was saying it&#39;s okay
it&#39;s my skin it&#39;s okay she accepted
herself she&#39;s three and a half I&#39;m 33 I
still haven&#39;t accepted myself the second
story I&#39;m going to tell you is about the
boy with the bags now one of the things
the tools we use to teach children
critical thinking in problem-solving are
these four bags
now one bag is a character bed where
children draw up and create their
characters and they pop these into the
bag the second bag is a setting bag and
it could be a piece of cloth or a piece
of paper the third bag is a problem bag
but children come up with a problem and
then the fourth bag is a solution bag
but children come up with a solution to
the problems which they&#39;ve created for
their characters now the end of this
week&#39;s lessons this boy again who&#39;s
three and a half went to his teacher and
said auntie can I take these bags home
please and the teacher said well we only
have one set of bags why do you want to
take this home and the boy said well my
parents are
always having fights and arguments at
home so I think that if I take these
bags and give it to them they can find a
solution to their problem now sadly the
teacher did not give this boy the bags
home but in that weekend and we know
these stories because these parents
actually come to school two week after
and keep on asking the teachers what do
you teach my child last week because he
or she has completely changed so what
happened that weekend was when his
parents were actually having an argument
in the house this boy would usually be
hiding in his bedroom actually went and
confronted his parents and he asked them
mummy daddy what&#39;s the problem because
if there is a problem let&#39;s find a
solution this is a three and a half year
old child what a moment of enlightenment
not just for him but for his parents
just imagine that if we teach every
child was three into seven to be more
empathetic to be more compassionate to
be kind to sit around a table and solve
their problems peacefully to be more
innovative and creative what kind of a
country or even world would we have just
imagine if each one of those children
was a dot and they would come together
with all other dots to create the fabric
of Sri Lanka for you in the world but
these dots these dots which are learning
social emotional intelligence they&#39;re
people special than the other dots they
are more in pathetic they&#39;re more
compassionate like problem solvers they
innovators now let&#39;s connect these dots
into a wave an unstoppable wave of
change evolving with every year of
social and emotional learning until
seventeen fifteen years time
when these children turn 18 you will see
a systematic generational change in the
mindset and skillset of an entire nation
now I&#39;m going to ask you again are you
still worried about the future because
in a world which thinks equal I kind of
feel good about it
thank you
[Applause]
