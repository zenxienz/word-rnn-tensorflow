the mind is king of heaven and earth
the mind is king of heaven and earth
invite a Greek to speak
you get philosophy what did you expect
it is literally in our DNA Plato
Socrates Aristotle and AXA Wallace and
some women to be partyi but here the mr.
fearless isara
the clue is in my name that I am Greek
Elizabeth not so much but Philip Uli
means the friend of horses pillows for
friend horse for I pose today this
evening in this beautiful building storm
and when it&#39;s beautiful Greek inspired
Greek inspired architecture we are going
to talk about bridges and some horses to
what is the bridge is it a connection a
communication a transition a
transformation an exit is it a symbol
what is a bridge a symbol and monument
the Parthenon the greatest monument in
the city of the classical Greece Athens
one of the greatest monuments in the
history of humanity a symbol a bridge
connecting the Athenians to their values
their civilization their thinking
connecting the Athenians to their gods
and the divine the Parthenon was a
temple the temple of goddess Athena the
goddess of wisdom and it was a bridge
between aspiration and actuality between
what we are and what we want to become
and isn&#39;t this really what we are
concerned about from all childhoods
what are we what is the bridge to the
future what is the bridge for our future
what are we going to become in my
childhood I was lucky my parents weren&#39;t
had a liberal mind and they were
encouraged me they were urging me to do
whatever I wanted in life there was
never a weak gender strong gender issue
never they said Elizabeth whatever you
want to be whatever you want to become
in life you can go for it a teacher a
thinker an entrepreneur Prime Minister
be genuine be passionate and do your
best and this is going to take you far I
decided to become a journalist it was in
the family it was in the DNA I covered
stories I traveled the world I met
people I was a storyteller but I was not
sure that this was really my bridge to
what I wanted to become I had a great
career first with Greek media was a main
anchor for Greek TV when I worked with
CNN al-jazeera an international career
but I had not found my bridge I thought
that no matter how many stories you tell
it is only a one-way street it&#39;s not a
communication it&#39;s not a bridge and what
we need to do is help people transform
to the better by creating dialogue
creating the beit&#39;s make them
communicate
I thought perhaps I should become a
bridge
but how do you do that right how do you
become a bridge
perhaps I could become I saw the
intellectual bridge a philosophical
bridge linking people minds ideas hopes
aspirations values and this is what I
did
bridges of the mind and this is what my
foundation does and I found my bridge in
life as women we always come across
bridges we are always forced to cross
bridges from young age to old age from
knowledge to wisdom from what we are to
what we want to become from happiness to
grief and if we are lucky back again we
are always forced across bridges when we
get stigmatized traumatized marginalized
we get abandoned on bridges we are being
left behind very often but we also leave
behind and bridges we abandoned we are a
bridge by nature our bodies are a bridge
our bodies connect humanity to its
future we give birth to life when we
talk about the bridge it&#39;s because there
is a gap there there is a rift there is
distance discontinuity gap social gap
inequality an emotional gap insecurity a
political gap incompetent leadership
gender gap who&#39;s stronger faster wiser
more powerful
does it matter really does it matter
there&#39;s an idea out there and with it&#39;s
been out there for a long time because
it&#39;s powerful
it&#39;s tempting it&#39;s insidious
it&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s this our women
guided both more by emotion and the
power of love our men guided more by
reason and the love of power emotion
reason reason emotion the love of power
the power of love is it a clash of
mindsets of ideas entire system
societies ideologies is socialism female
and capital is male it&#39;s technology male
and philanthropy female
where do gender stand women from Venus
men from Mars what a cliche whatever we
are woman man or the third sex whatever
we are in life whatever we choose to be
all we choose to do
above all we need to acknowledge that
there is a lot going on out there in our
world which does not seem right
break6 Catalonia and Spain inequality
poverty a crumbling eurozone socialism
doesn&#39;t work capitalism doesn&#39;t work
democracy doesn&#39;t work bring people
together man people we do not like what
is this where is reason where is emotion
emotion is great it makes us feel human
but it is not enough it&#39;s too emotional
too sentimental too simplistic
unrealistic inconsistent reason is
excellent it makes us feel smart
powerful
but it misses out on many things
kindness fairness respect empathy
compassion what is the balance between
the two emotion is the bridge between
knowledge and wisdom and I would like to
introduce to you a word which he
probably never heard before
unless you&#39;ve studied Greek the word
knows knows not new for friend that
knows which is another word or mind a
word introduced by those ancient Greek
philosophers 2,000 years ago it&#39;s a
bridge notes is a bridge between the
heart the soul and the intellect it is
what connects us to our common sense to
our accurate judgment is what makes us
understand and distinguish between what
is false know what is true what is real
and what is unreal to those Greek
philosophers back then
it was our connection to the divine to
the cosmic order this is the balance
that I&#39;m going to urge all of us to find
women or men we need to connect with our
news because it&#39;s going to be how we are
going to influence what&#39;s happening in
our world it is the choice between
reason and emotion and the balance
between those two as women for the first
time in history for the first time in
humanity we are crossing our own bridges
in millions we are achieving a lot
we&#39;re speaking up we&#39;re finding our
voice finding our purpose we are pushing
back we are claiming we are demanding we
are challenging we are networking we are
succeeding it is up to us to connect to
our news and understand what bridge is
out there we need to burn what bridge is
out there we need to bring down because
they are dysfunctional or they&#39;re
fragile or they lead us to the wrong
direction or they lead nowhere
as women we need to find the bridges the
bridges of shame and bring them down
bring them down and never allow the
Weinsteins of this world to get into our
lives we need to burn the bridges of
shame and shame those who deserve it
no you shall not pass when you leave
today I would like you to remember this
word the word the noose and visit the
bridges in your life visit how you can
become a bridge how you can connect
yourself to a mission that speaks to
your heart to a mission that is going to
make this world a better place
think of the bridges that you are going
to burn and let them light the way ahead
connect to your news and change your
life
connect to your news and you can change
the world build bridges that are strong
and then get on your horse and gallop
across them
thank you
you
