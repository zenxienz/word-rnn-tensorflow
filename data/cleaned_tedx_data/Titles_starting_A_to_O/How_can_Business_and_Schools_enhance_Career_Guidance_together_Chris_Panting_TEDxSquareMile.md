thank you so much for having me it&#39;s a
pleasure to be here when I was asked to
give this speech I spoke to Alan about
the issue of business and careers and
that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about and
it&#39;s about this question I could
business schools to enhance Career
Guidance now when we go back to our time
at school
many of us will have had the experience
of the careers advisor open school in
the nineties and whose advisers
certainly followed us had fallen a
certain path that path would normally be
10 minutes interview where you would
arrive for the interview you&#39;d hope your
concerns about careers would be sorted
in that 10 minute chat you wouldn&#39;t have
thought much about it beforehand you&#39;d
go in and meet someone that if you&#39;ve
been honest didn&#39;t look like they either
had had a great career themselves or
possibly knew much about any other
career other than they might with 10
minutes worth of suggestions they didn&#39;t
know me and then that was it that was
the box ticked off suggestions I had in
my three careers interviews ranged for
piano chena it was niche in shropshire
and be niche if I would have thought
everywhere as armed services that was
not going to be good for me and at my
last one when I was actually for a very
brief period between jobs I was signing
on I was suggested secure call none of
which really animated me about my career
choice for the future now this concept
of careers advice actually tragically
has stayed in much of schools and there
are fatal flaws in the way that we
approach it interviews it&#39;s determined
to fit in with the career to interview
up and the students and the student is
not asked much in preparation before
what they do and this is one of possibly
the three biggest voices that a student
and individual make in their life
and we don&#39;t give them a chance to think
about what is important to them the
we advise is generally suited to fit the
process of the interviewer rather than
the school now what we was I was asked
to do at my school was to look at how we
could modify and actually cut the costs
of our main event which the Careers Fair
had been privately organized cost about
six seven thousand pounds a year it
wouldn&#39;t cost the vast amounts but it
had been organized privately for years
and they&#39;ve managed to get thirty
exhibitors into the school and these
exhibitors have come every other year
and because of the looming threat of
austerity my hat said you&#39;ve got to cut
the costs and go for a cheaper option
and that option we despised was to
create a linking with parents and to
link it with the community and try and
do something for a bit bit less what
we&#39;ve actually developed is a career
spell it&#39;s gone way beyond our
expectations
so we&#39;ve involved over 200 exhibitors
200 exhibitors have come to our school a
school of 1500 at Dorking a normal
comprehensive and they come from a vast
range so we&#39;ve got Oxford University
then we&#39;ve got Cambridge University
we&#39;ve even got Maastricht University who
are still coming postback states we&#39;ve
got KPMG we&#39;ve got multinationals so
including Lloyd including Pfizer
including Canon and the list goes on and
we&#39;ve got a really booming Technology
Park in Guildford
so so each satellite technology and one
of the really great companies that
support us but we&#39;ve also got randomly a
horse masseuse and she comes every year
and I dare say that none of the students
are going to become horse masseuses
maybe one or two but the beauty of
having that is that a student will say
if I didn&#39;t know that you could be a
horse masseuse what are the other
companies and jobs and careers that I&#39;d
never know existed now this was one of
those great moments this was just one of
the rooms of our school
comprehensive school and this was one of
the rooms of our career suppose we&#39;ve
got two other rooms that replicate that
and all of those companies have come
along to speak to our students and they
came with the proviso one key mantra you
must love your job so you must love your
job and sell that job off and if you
look in there there&#39;s a whole range of
different people that have come to self
our students that there is a job for
them that they could love that they
could believe in and that they could be
good at and for every student we
guarantee that there will be something
there for them now this experience has
led to us to have a number of real
impacts a number of learning curves the
first one is that the best careers
advice is unplanned back at my choice of
career I&#39;m really lucky I love doing my
job it&#39;s a fantastic job it has its
moments I stumbled into it there are a
number of jobs I still do not know about
and because I didn&#39;t know they existed I
didn&#39;t look for them now we found that
the best various advices are planned so
students will come to our careers fair
and there we&#39;ll go and meet people that
they would never even consider going to
see including the horse masseuse uh and
we&#39;ve done that and we&#39;ve noticed the
impact particularly the impact of those
students who felt that they had a
predetermined career choice
we&#39;ve had a speed-dating event
speed-dating for correct it&#39;s fantastic
twenty five careers in a room and they
go from career to career everything well
every student asked how much do you earn
but once they got that they&#39;ve actually
met and been introduced to careers that
they would never dream of our last event
had someone that designed costumes for
pizza but we had an officer with a
graphic designer who had actually many
many more all of which were combined by
the fact they were all like students of
our school but we also find the impact
has been a real
impacts on soft skills and presentation
skills it was fantastic to see Clements
speak before and it was wonderful to see
how confident as a six former he was to
this audience and what students as good
at to that but we didn&#39;t find it
difficult in a state section with all of
the accountabilities and targets to fit
that in and what we&#39;ve committed to with
our business thinks his every student
will have a mock interview and every
student will be able to present and
pitch an idea and what&#39;s being
particularly good is having link with
young enterprise now Jenny is a flipped
by student but she says this she&#39;s been
involved with your enterprises those who
don&#39;t know young enterprises arts
enterprise for one year students trade
as an actual company they get a loan and
they set up a company and they produce a
product and Jenny and her a group I made
already two thousand pounds in September
they&#39;ve made it on second hand cups that
they&#39;ve turned into candles if I buy one
for Mother&#39;s Day next week it&#39;s probably
not going to go down overly well but
it&#39;s got a market and that market
they&#39;re selling like hotcakes and Jenny
I think the great quote is from Jenny
because she&#39;ll probably get she&#39;ll go
into a muscle groups at universities
I&#39;m keeping my options more open and
before I would have never thought of
getting a job in social media
one of the most hard aspects of young
enterprises being that the impact is
having dyslexic students dyslexic
students each year it seems to take part
I&#39;m last year one student was able to to
300 students I feeling for people in the
audience to pitch her idea of a boutique
team she&#39;s now gone on to be a graphic
that&#39;s working graphic design and her
ambition is to form a company she&#39;s
never done anything like that before
this we wants to a fact that businesses
benefit um they&#39;re linked to the school
pmw were marketing their new i3 and they
said they wanted to adopt new marketing
approach and to get to the parents they
introduced a simulation game and they
asked our students to market it they
knew they were going to get the good PR
in our local
they could get good PR the paper but the
game was fantastic and it meant that the
students have the credibility of BMW
attached to it rather than just some
teacher initiative and BMW were great
they brought their chief diver executive
of Irvine&#39;s the company that helped us
but they also went down to the
apprenticeship and that really inspired
our students to be involved with this
strongly urged if any with business here
is that business simulations really do
work but actually it can benefit
business because the ideas that come out
from it are fantastic and BMW used a
number now there are many other simple
things that could be done to really help
students particularly in state skills to
find a career that matches their needs
first thing is we benefit from inspiring
stories we often have to pay for people
to come in there are some fantastic
agencies that have developed founders
for school too one particular one but
often it&#39;s quite difficult to match the
speaker to the needs of the school and
when a student listens to someone
inspiring it can change and transform
lives and this is one such group that
have been able to do this particularly
if that&#39;s storming veteran eights with
our students so if it&#39;s the next
students if it&#39;s someone who&#39;s had
dyslexia someone who&#39;s had autism
someone that&#39;s come from a poor
background it really really does
resonate with our students that it is
possible to be able to have a successful
career in business the second thing I&#39;d
really be interested is about the idea
of flexible recruitment we&#39;ve got
students that I know would be amazing in
business but they can&#39;t get into
business because they don&#39;t match the
quite rigid needs of those companies
last week we just finished their work
experience boy called Karen are
absolutely delightful young man who&#39;s
dyslexic but it&#39;s a struggle to access
certain parts of the curriculum he went
and worked in a recruitment company in
London a week they&#39;ve offered him an
apprenticeship I can guarantee he would
not have had that apprenticeship without
it I&#39;ve got a boy who does I think
police have said no way
I please dope but police have said he&#39;s
one of the best programmers that they
have met at that age now I keep saying
to him go and find someone to do it I&#39;d
love to pick up the phone to an IT
company so I&#39;ve got some of these
amazing but if you look to this report
it&#39;s shocking what why don&#39;t companies
invest in potential if they knew the
schools maybe they would do and that&#39;s
my big urge to companies
have a look at who you are recruiting
can you take a risk do you make loot for
your own reasons that it&#39;s easier for
you to have tests and then have quite a
rigid criteria or do you look outside
the box and think who could you bring in
the third thing and this is a real
passion of mine is high quality
inclusive work experience we all can
probably think back to our work
experience moments with shock and worry
I certainly did I always share this with
students that no one spoke to me for six
hours and didn&#39;t offer me any birthday
cake and it&#39;s Harnish my career in
surveying I never went any further
however work experience is really
nerve-racking for many of our students
when they get there they&#39;re fantastic
they&#39;re billions but it&#39;s really
difficult how many of you are in
companies where parents have arranged
work experience with our children or
their children&#39;s friends go away and
this helped the company to do something
simple only do work experience if it&#39;s
applied for by the students then might
we there will be networks but at least
get the student to apply for it I found
that fantastic to get that so if our
students apply it really adds to the
experience but if you&#39;ve got a student
on work experience remember you were
there high quality worth experience is
transformative to the student and to the
student but it also might be
transformative to the business you might
spot someone with the potential that
would not come out on an application
form and then think about the
advertising how do you connect with
communities that may not necessarily
automatically look at the adverts this
is an indication of a Steve Jobs habit
that Pacific
I think you&#39;ve all times more likely to
be a millionaire if you dyslexic there&#39;s
some fascinating thing about that but
and this agency said they were only
deploying dyslexic
I&#39;ve had some great stuff last week last
year about autistic children and how
certain companies believed that they
were going to recruit autistic child
because they offered a different skill
set if I was in business I&#39;ve been
looking at my long-term unemployed
because if you&#39;re employed sitting three
of those from really good potential
backgrounds a guarantee that you&#39;ll get
loyalty and skills that go beyond normal
millennial check our graduate generation
you&#39;ll get something different and I
would suspect you might get something
better but often the advertising jobs
are not seen how many jobs and not seen
how many people have missed their
perfect job and more importantly how
many missed businesses have missed their
perfect person I cannot explain to you
if you go away and fight try and fathom
the apprenticeship program how you apply
for Prentiss ship is so complicated you
guys for friends of ship it would be
amazing if we did because and people
don&#39;t know deadlines they don&#39;t know how
to do it that&#39;s one example of many many
things advertising jobs for all
communities would really help and
strengthen inclusive recruitment when I
look back at our vision our vision is
quite general this is a quote from
Howard Gardner academic for America he
believes that if we want to live a
fulfilled life we should be experts in
our career we should be enthusiastic
about our career and we should believe
in the ethos now we&#39;re not back to my
experiences with the curious interviewer
not at one stage did they ever ask me
what I believed I did once say I wanted
to be a teacher because I believed in
education was important they told me
don&#39;t know we&#39;ll ask me what I thought I
liked and they looked at my CV and
believed because I did
so I&#39;d be good at accountancy if we
could get this right and it links back
to what Dave said in the first speech it
would be transformative it would be
transformative to the individual but it
would also be transformative for
business it would mean we have the right
people in the right positions and that
could transform lives and it&#39;s a school
leader that is the thing that inspires
me day in day out it&#39;s not the exam
results but it&#39;s beyond can we get
students into careers that mean that
they could live fulfilled lives and if
we work with businesses more closely
then those students will be exposed to a
vast a range of careers so that it&#39;s
about a career will be far more
reflective far more meaningful and meet
their individual requirements so thank
you so much listening
you
