how&#39;s it going I&#39;m gonna bring this over
here Wow my name is Danny Michelle I&#39;m
LA I&#39;m from Kitchener right here this is
my hometown and I I came to this room in
this room I came and saw all the first
concerts when I was a little kid i sat
there I&#39;ve sat there I&#39;ve sat there sat
there I&#39;ve been here a million times so
it is a total joy to be in this room I
know I told you I am a musician so my
talk is going to be less professional
I&#39;m just gonna kind of tell you a story
I think this is a video I took with a
camera that was gaffing taped to a
broomstick and I&#39;m laying on my stomach
sticking my arm out the whole of the
side of this icebreaker where the chain
the anchor goes out and as we crush
through the top of the world and if
you&#39;re wondering how did I get in that
bizarre position I got a call at the
beginning of last year from Evan
Hadfield who&#39;s the the son of Canadian
astronaut Chris Hadfield and they gave
me a call and they said hey Danny would
you be interested in going to the Arctic
I was like well I didn&#39;t say to them I
said yes colonel and and I said well
what&#39;s what&#39;s it all about he said well
we&#39;re gonna take a little group about 12
people from around the world their
favorite scientists and photographers
and filmmakers and authors and you guys
know have you heard of the photographer
Ben Brown
Ben was with us Ben was with us and the
film crew who worked on the TV show
MythBusters they were there
yeah they were awesome and and the guys
they said they said Danny we want you to
be the music person and I was like okay
I guess I could sing some songs while
you guys are working and whatnot and so
I was like I still didn&#39;t understand
what like what am i what am i doing and
and the mission was our mission was to
go and experience this incredible part
of our planet and go on this adventure
and then we were all supposed to come
back and share it with the world however
we wanted which is such a gift to an
artist to be able to have like no rules
and just here do whatever you want and
so and then the great news is that we
would be traveling on this ship called
the captain collab in the kava 24
thousand horsepower Soviet era Russian
icebreaker
the the only ship in the world to
circumnavigate both the Arctic and the
Antarctic all I can say is this ship is
badass like it&#39;s oh it&#39;s such a wicked
ship it has helicopters on it it has
cranes with zodiac boats and it has
helicopters and the best way I could
describe it there it is it is kind of
like a cross between the grand Budapest
hotel and the Millennium Falcon that&#39;s
how I there it is and there&#39;s the
chopper pad at the back and I lived in
the corner window up there from cabin
712 and for 18 days we had no Wi-Fi no
cell service we could not talk to our
families if we wanted to it was no
communication and this video a lot of
this is shot by Ben Brown and so again I
felt like everyone started taking photos
I thought well what am I gonna do I&#39;m
gonna write a song and I didn&#39;t know
what to do so I thought okay well I will
write a song and I thought I need to do
something bigger so I thought I&#39;m gonna
what if I write an entire album and I
thought that&#39;s pretty you know that&#39;s a
lot of work and that&#39;s challenging and I
thought well this this deserves it this
is a pretty big honor to do this so I
thought okay I will write an entire
album but on top of that it&#39;s got to be
even better I thought I will record the
entire album on the ship during
the trip so I set up a little recording
studio in Cabin 712 it&#39;s kind of like
recording in a Motorhome bathroom and I
had a little computer and some really
nice microphones and I hung towels
around for baffling and I made an entire
record and then I brought that recording
back to Toronto and I gave it to my
buddy Rob Carly who&#39;s from Kitchener
here too and he does he&#39;s a film cos he
does a film composing music and TV and
stuff and so he arranged the little
songs that I recorded with the symphony
with brass and strings and it&#39;s just
like it&#39;s crazy and now suddenly I have
a classical record that&#39;s kind of
Russian based and Chris sings on it in
Russian and the dishwasher&#39;s on the ship
sing on it and it&#39;s just this crazy
thing that I can&#39;t even ever imagine
would have happened to my life musically
and so I&#39;ll play a song for me this is
the first song I wrote do it a little
quiet version I wish that you could hear
all the strings and stuff but you just
have to imagine it okay so um every day
we would go on these adventures we&#39;d be
in choppers and zodiacs and then as we
head back we&#39;d see the club in the
coffin I just fell in love with it was
it with home and and it was you know
it&#39;s a rough environment so it was nice
to see it again you&#39;d be like okay we&#39;re
back we&#39;re back we made it and then we&#39;d
sit in the lounge and Chris and me would
sing songs and we&#39;d have Russian soup
and and this was the first song I wrote
and I thought it&#39;s got a sound Russian
[Music]
we were all back in for dodging icebergs
changing cars along the broken fjord
everything screwed to the floor it&#39;s the
end of the line there&#39;s nothing left and
in the sled-dogs frozen breath the Sun
burns the moon away
the constellations hide their face back
to kaletnik our four hot super vodka
shots I sing songs with cosmonauts
aboard collab Nicole and the icebergs
roll in the broken night the humpback
blows a kiss goodnight with harpoons
scars and lonely eyes my heart breaks
open wide and the faint smell of
cigarettes the Sun here it never says
the black sea the silver sky the
constellations liquefied back to
kaletnik are for hot soup and vodka
shots we dance to rakhmaninov aboard
kaletnik oh you know what I just thought
of a way that I could show you what it
sounds like
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
anyways it goes on and on like rats you
kill in the car for hot soup and vodka
shots I sing songs with astronauts
aboard Colette Nicole
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so never in my life did I think I&#39;d
write a song like that and never in my
life did I think oh I&#39;ll be playing that
next week with Chris Hadfield with the
Vancouver Symphony I&#39;m like if you said
to me last year Danny I bet next year
you&#39;ll be singing a Russian classical
record with an astronaut in the symphony
I would just lay on the ground and I
would laugh and laugh and laugh but
these are the things that happen if you
take a chance and and and get out of
your comfort zone and dare yourself to
do something that is bigger than you and
and so I kind of this is my thing I
challenge you all to to do that same
thing to to do it to bite off more than
you can chew if it doesn&#39;t you know it
doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s fun learning right you
learn something from it
I think when you&#39;re doing something
creative the best thing to do is to go
into the water just a little too deep
and when your feet can&#39;t touch the
ground that&#39;s right when you&#39;re about to
do something cool so I&#39;m gonna leave you
is one more song that hopefully can
inspire that to another tune of mine and
I wrote the song individually and
personally for each one of you
personally for you

want are there sing if you wanna sing
