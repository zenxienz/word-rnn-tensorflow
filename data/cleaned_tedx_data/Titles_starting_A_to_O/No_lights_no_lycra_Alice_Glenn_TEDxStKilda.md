hi my name is Ellis and I love dancing
public speaking not so much but I love
dancing my parents talk about me as that
kind of kid that had ants in their pants
I was always twirling and cartwheeling
and jumping around the house and driving
everybody crazy like many kids I did
weekly classes in ballet and jazz and
contemporary and then I went on to
pursue that love at university but after
years and years of dancing in front of a
mirror trying to move my body the way
the teacher was moving there&#39;s I felt
like I was constantly comparing myself
to the best student in the class when I
danced for myself I felt great but when
I compared myself to others I felt like
I didn&#39;t fit the mold I became so
self-conscious and self-critical I just
started to lose the love for dance it
was when I was studying contemporary
dance at Deakin University that I met a
like-minded soul Heidi like me had had
the same frustrations and joys and
dissatisfaction with the dance world how
could something we love so much make us
feel so self-critical and so
uncomfortable in ourselves how could
really transform this thing that we love
so much put it back into a joyful
environment where we weren&#39;t criticizing
ourselves and we enjoyed dancing again
the antrum turn out the lights so we
gave it a go we booked out a Hall in
Fitzroy and invited five of our friends
to come and join us for what we called a
real dance there were no mirrors there
were no lights there were no steps to
learn there was no teacher there was no
one watching it was just a place for us
to enjoy dancing for ourselves again
because dancing feels really good and
it&#39;s a perfectly human thing to do we
played really fun music silly music that
made us laugh and we covered every
of the dance floor the following week
there were 20 people in the room with us
the week after that there were 40 and
before we knew it it had taken on a life
of its own we called it no lights no
lycra now eight years later there are
seven nights running across Melbourne
packed with people of all ages dancing
to music from all genres there&#39;s at
least one though lights no locker in
every major city in Australia and
there&#39;s about 75 communities around the
world
anyone can start up a no lights no lycra
you just go to our website and sign up
we also now have a free phone app that
takes over your phone once a day
interrupt you whatever you&#39;re doing and
forces you to take a dance break for
five minutes
stop what you&#39;re doing and let it out so
what is it about dancing in the dark
that is so powerful it&#39;s a safe place in
the dark to be spontaneous and to be
silly and to dance in whatever way feels
comfortable for you at that time it&#39;s a
place to switch off from the very busy
world that we have and to switch off our
very busy minds as well it&#39;s a great
place to stretch and loosen up when
you&#39;ve been sitting in the audience for
a while and it&#39;s a great thing to do
with a roomful of strangers so I&#39;d like
to invite you all to join me in a dance
break right now if you don&#39;t like to
stand where you are you&#39;re welcome to
spread out into the aisles and if you&#39;re
feeling really stiff you can head to the
back of the room where there&#39;s heaps of
room be mindful of each other obviously
keep your limbs a little bit contained
we&#39;re gonna switch off the lights and
we&#39;re gonna have a dance right now
