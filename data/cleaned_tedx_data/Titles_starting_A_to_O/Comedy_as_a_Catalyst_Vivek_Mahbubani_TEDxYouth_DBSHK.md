all right hey how&#39;s everyone doing
tonight it is an absolute pleasure to be
back in DBS the first time after that
I&#39;m here after school hours and it&#39;s not
for punishment so it&#39;s a big occasion
for me at Camden I&#39;m still here so um as
a comedian I find it&#39;s very strange
because it this kind of a career people
have a lot of sumption they always think
like oh you&#39;re always either always
funny or they can&#39;t take me seriously
which means that let&#39;s say one day I get
stabbed on the streets right I&#39;m dying
I&#39;m bleeding I go to the hospital I walk
in people like oh is it Halloween is it
April Fool&#39;s and I&#39;m like it&#39;s an
emergency guys come on
somebody help right nobody has a
calendar but I&#39;m really here to talk
about you know as a comedian or like the
comedy life what makes me a comedian
versus somebody else like why is it that
I can see a world maybe you could say
differently do I think faster than you
do I have a something that helps me
think better not really as a comedian
all I&#39;m really doing is I&#39;m telling you
things that you may not have realized or
seeing it from a new angle and that
angle hopefully will make you think
differently and then laugh about it and
another thing I do as a comedian is I
take what we normally just say is normal
to us that we just say yep that&#39;s how it
is we normalize things and I ask why
like a kid you know like the young kids
that annoy you like why why why that&#39;s
what I do but I&#39;m 34 that&#39;s I I just
never grew up right so think of it this
way a lot of things we do in life we
just do it repeatedly and we accept it
as the way we go for it so this the
other day I was taking a Tran and you
know that&#39;s lining up and Sonny this guy
just cut in he was like oh I&#39;m in a rush
up size filler you get on you rushes
onto the tram cause easier than rush
number one if you&#39;re in a rush why take
a tram like do you not understand you
could run you could take a taxi take a
bus to track okay and number two you
realized by cutting in front of me you
still have to wait for me to get on that
tram so now I could be like you know
what I&#39;m gonna take my time
I&#39;m on the moon
right I could do that so as a comic what
I&#39;m constantly doing is why why why and
the second thing I do after asking why
is that try to find my own explanation I
try to explain the situation with no
research basically I&#39;m doing what I used
to do in school we just write a bunch of
rubbish and pray to God somebody gives
me a grade all right so thank you DBS
for all those years of practice that
with a teacher like bad and I guess that
can&#39;t be in one year right now what I
find though is that the more I think
this way the more my world changes in
the sense I&#39;m living in the exact same
world as you guys however how come I can
find that angle because I&#39;m constantly
trying to find a new angle of explaining
the situation rather than saying why is
this what is the logical reasoning tell
me why let me research let me use my
brain let me look at history I&#39;m simply
using ignorant to try to explain a
situation like I guess it&#39;s because of
this and that&#39;s in a way creativity
right the catalyst for me is constantly
asking people who are cept reality why
why is it so why is this okay why do we
do that let me give you an example we do
a lot of things in our daily lives and
after a while we don&#39;t even question it
but why is it that somebody from
overseas comes to Hong Kong and they&#39;re
like um people are very weird why do you
do this I&#39;m confused because it&#39;s so
abnormal to them now for me the fun part
is that my job is to find the
abnormalities of life and tell it to you
and then make you laugh I am not finding
a funny thing in life I&#39;m simply finding
what is interesting in life and I
encourage you to make it a game for
yourself what is interesting in life not
what is funny because we do not live in
a funny world we live in a very
interesting world and my job as a
comedian is not to find funny not to
live funny not to say funny but to look
at interesting and tell it to you in a
funny way where you never thought of it
that way
prime example we&#39;ve all taken the MTR
trains here in Hong Kong right we&#39;ve all
done it and I find I can use that to
explain life a lot of people asked me
viv do you believe in equality in the
world you know you&#39;re an ethnic minority
in Hong Kong do you feel discrimination
bla bla bla bla bla right and I always
say number one I
do not believe in equality no one was
born equal someone has long arms or
shorter arms it&#39;s an equal that&#39;s how it
is that&#39;s how the world is the thing
though is that even in our daily lives
we are not fair to everything for
example you get on the MTR train right
you see those six empty seats they are
completely equal seats with the same
function but we don&#39;t treat them equally
we look at them and the first priority
is the seats on the sides right and so
we all do nobody taught you this you
just naturally feel that&#39;s the best seat
they&#39;re not more comfortable the only
reason you picked those seats is number
one because in Hong Kong we do not like
having people on both sides of our
shoulders right it minimizes the chance
of someone falling asleep on us because
one side is human the other side is
plastic wall even if somebody&#39;s butt is
squeezed against the wall you&#39;re like
you know what it&#39;s warm I&#39;ll take it
I&#39;ll take it it&#39;s warm yes oh it will
never fall asleep on me yes right then
let&#39;s say those side two seats are taken
what are the other options we got four
more seats right what do we do we go for
the middle two seats right why cuz
there&#39;s the pillar in the middle that&#39;s
a symbol I don&#39;t know you you don&#39;t know
me don&#39;t you dare cross the line don&#39;t
fall asleep
okay right you continue now those two
seats in the middle I&#39;ve taken two seats
on the sides are taken what do we do we
look at those two empty seats there but
we don&#39;t just sit there we judge who&#39;s
sitting next to those seats who&#39;s on
that side who&#39;s in the middle because if
you find there&#39;s a fat guy and a
sleeping guy you&#39;re like you know what I
will stand it&#39;s okay
right cuz god forbid I&#39;m sitting there
guy gets fatter guy falls asleep I&#39;m
like I cannot go anywhere oh god what am
i doing now let&#39;s take a step back what
did I just tell you just now I told you
literally nothing knowledgeable I simply
just told you about reality something we
all do we all know I do not live a
funnier life than you but I looked at it
in a different way I did
it&#39;s you in a funny way so has a comic
I&#39;m not really looking for the funny I&#39;m
not trying to think faster than you I&#39;m
simply trying to use things to inspire
me to find a new angle and I encourage
you play a game with yourself how can
you make something interesting you know
what is the interesting in life why do
we do this in Hong Kong there&#39;s so many
habits we do in Hong Kong we don&#39;t
realise take the minibus it&#39;s another
prime example we do the exact same thing
taking the minibus step number one you
go to the minibus line what do we do we
count how many people are in front of me
one two three four five now let&#39;s say
you&#39;re number four you do not care how
many million people are next to you
right you&#39;re number four you carry your
five minute irrelevant
I don&#39;t care doesn&#39;t matter you are
insignificant to me so let&#39;s say you&#39;re
lining up now you know you&#39;re number
four what do you do immediately you
start pre God you know you like please
next bus four seats just gonna be four
sisters no for me four she&#39;ll be quick
minibus arrives what do we all do we&#39;re
all right right of course never not
everybody scooby-doo we&#39;re all like I
don&#39;t care right but we&#39;re all right so
now we&#39;re counting the minibus has four
seats you&#39;re number four but the true
joy is not in getting on the minibus it
is in knowing that you are number four
and there are only four seats right
because you know because you existed
number five over here has to wait for
the next bus all right and you start to
sing in your head you start seeing the
I&#39;m number four you&#39;re number five five
in Chinese is mmm means no right
[Applause]
and let&#39;s be honest we all do that we
all think the same things but some of us
wear ties when we&#39;re doing it
some of us wear high heels some of us
wear these shoes you know we all do the
same thing so it&#39;s not that I&#39;m living
in a funnier world than you it&#39;s not
that I&#39;m sunny so much smarter than you
I&#39;m simply asking why do we do this a
lot of things that are normal to us
we just take it for granted that&#39;s how
it is you know that&#39;s Hong Kong what are
you gonna do right you know you see the
yellow line you stand behind the yellow
line that&#39;s it that&#39;s the rule right so
I ask why as a comic that&#39;s all I&#39;m
really doing every day my job is to
simply challenge reality and say why why
why and why in itself inspires me to see
the world in a new way and by doing that
I&#39;m sunny seeing gaps in a lot of
reality a lot of things we do that are
boring to you now is funny to me I can
guarantee you from today onwards every
time you take the mini bus if you find
yourself lining up and you happen to be
number 4 you will be like your friend is
like are you crazy or like you won&#39;t get
it you won&#39;t get it
mm using number 5 I&#39;m number 4 mmm you
won&#39;t get it right no okay another thing
I always tell people is that what I try
to do and I encourage you try is out
game and fie your life turn your life
into a game like for me every day my job
is to constantly find funny stuff that I
can tell people right but I&#39;m not
looking for funny I said I&#39;m looking for
interesting so my game is how many
interesting things today can that turn
into funny things tomorrow that&#39;s my
game I can tell you a lot of situations
could be very negative but because I saw
I quote unquote game of iris suddenly
it&#39;s a fun thing for me I&#39;ll give you a
prime example I have done many shows
where let&#39;s say the audience is not
interested in watching a comedy show
it&#39;s a private event
that&#39;s a dinner party they booked me to
entertain them but people don&#39;t care
right I walked into this room one time I
saw the audience they were clearly not
interested in any performance now a
normal human being with a logical brain
will say wow this is failure you know
this is a this is recipe for failure but
in my head I&#39;m thinking this is a game
this is like like one of those game
shows at night you know ladies and
gentlemen let&#39;s play will they laugh
right so now in my head I&#39;m thinking all
right guard contestant number one
through the back my blue bonnie here&#39;s
the background as comedy will they
laughter that let&#39;s check it out tonight
right
so this is the way I turn the situation
from a very like oh my god I&#39;m gonna die
these people don&#39;t care to woo I wonder
if anybody will giggle will someone
cough
will someone choke to death what will
happen right so that way I&#39;m sunny
turning a situation that had never
changed that the situation didn&#39;t change
I simply changed the way I saw it and
played with them so in a way is catalyst
by itself it&#39;s simply finding a way to
see something from a new angle we&#39;ve
talked about it earlier on like I said
like oh everyone first speaker even said
you want to do a character in a drama
piece and you you&#39;re worried someone
will be insulted just say he has a small
penis okay so that&#39;s the rule right so
that so now from now onwards anytime I
tell anybody I offend an audience I&#39;m so
sorry I wasn&#39;t talking about you I was
talking about a guy with a small penis
the audience like oh it&#39;s okay then I&#39;m
not offended I have a big one I can I&#39;ve
I can prove it to you trust me you know
that sort of thing so it&#39;s a lot of
these things that I could say as a comic
what I&#39;m really trying to do is that all
I play is that I try to see the world
and I forced myself to take away all the
things I learned in DBS and all is yours
I took everything that teachers taught
and lucky for me I stepped in most of my
classes which is why I&#39;m able to do what
I do today we just take nothing I
learned in school and see the world in a
way that most people forget to see
anymore basically I&#39;m encouraging you
turn your day into a game how many
things can you find interesting and ask
yourself why and the thing is that that
is inspiration right asking yourself why
why why is inspiration and a very simple
tactic to find motivation every day is
when people say why not write so when
you ask yourself why and she&#39;s something
and you&#39;re like why why why many times
if you don&#39;t know how to explain it just
say you know what why not so it&#39;s in a
way you inspire yourself to be motivated
right so what I&#39;m trying to say the last
thing before I go is that think of it
this way
every day the world would not be funny
the world is not funny but it is your
choice how you see it and it has a
comedian my job is to not only see it
funny but to make it funny so I see it
interesting but to make it funny and
then charge you to hear me tell you
something you already know and then go
home laughing all the way to the bank
all right thank you much that is my time
it&#39;s been a pleasure thank you
[Applause]
