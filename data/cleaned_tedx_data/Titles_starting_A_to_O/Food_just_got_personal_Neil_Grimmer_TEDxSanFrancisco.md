not your mom not your milk these are
words that I live by for 12 years as a
teenage punk rock animal rights activist
you could have characterized me at the
time as a mildly militant vegan where
every squishy bite of tofu is an act of
defiance every plate a mini protest in
mealtime well that was my soapbox to
speak truth to power you see at that
time food was political 12 years of
vegan and it couldn&#39;t keep up with my
Ironman aspirations so I had to shift
gears and food became purely functional
I weighed my food I measured my food
every mealtime was a math calculation a
formula to get to single digit body fat
percentages and endurance that could go
the distance and I saw results so I
doubled down 6% body fat and folks
that&#39;s when things went horribly wrong
as you can see see my wife and I were
actually trying to have a baby at that
time and it wasn&#39;t going so well a trip
to the doctor revealed that actually my
body was shutting down on me I had what
was called athlete&#39;s heart where you&#39;re
actually metabolizing your heart muscle
for fuel I was anemic I had fatty liver
and my hypothalamus literally stopped
working which regulates among other
things your fertility so after a long
break from racing and a slow recovery
two years later I&#39;m pleased to report
that my wife and I had our first child
and that&#39;s when food became love small
group of parents and I got together to
change the way the kids eat from
bringing the very best food to little
ones from the very first bite we were on
a mission and because of that we became
one of the fastest growing food
companies in America and while we were
all super focused on the health of kids
some of us through the process lost our
health along the way in my early 40s I
was overworked overfed and completely
stressed out food became my comfort it
became my reward and ultimately it
became my nemesis you see I was 65
pounds heavier than I was when I was
racing I was pre-diabetic and high risk
for a heart attack I knew I had to do
something but quite frankly after 30
years of hacking my food I was really
lost and one question loom large what
foods are right for me well it turns out
we&#39;ve been asking this question since
the dawn of time one wrong food choice
from one wrong tree sent the world in
disarray just imagine just imagine if
Eve actually knew what foods were right
for her from that time the answer the
question what foods were right for me
was based on what we could hunt and what
we could gather in the first
Agricultural Revolution it was based on
what we could grow what we could raise
and what we could harvest and for the
last two centuries we&#39;ve literally tried
thousands of ways to answer that
question we&#39;ve tried the grapefruit diet
we&#39;ve tried the fast food diet we tried
the cabbage soup diet from high carb to
low carb from low fat to high fat and
everything in between
where one day eggs are bad the next day
they&#39;re good it&#39;s no wonder we&#39;re all so
confused to what foods are right for us
and while there&#39;s been a lot of wisdom
and nutrition wisdom amongst the ages
the one thing we&#39;ve always gotten wrong
is we&#39;ve always taken a
one-size-fits-all approach to food
I believe in 2017 it&#39;s going to be the
era of you the era of personalization
the era where we look inside of
ourselves to the answer the question
what foods are right for us powered by
big data and computational biology for
the first time ever
actually able to tap into the
nutritional insights that live inside of
our DNA our blood work our gut
microbiome and even our metabolism now I
personally benefited from this approach
as a guy who&#39;s pre-diabetic and high
risk for a heart attack I literally got
every test I could imagine done I
gathered up all of that biology sat down
with some specialists to help me craft a
food plan that would find and unlock the
healthiest version of myself and after
some work I got the plan and I was off
to the races after one month I felt
amazing after six months I had lost 25
pounds and I had more energy than I had
in years and all of my blood work came
back to healthy levels you see I had a
new lease on life but this time for the
first time I actually let my body do the
talking so at this point in this
conversation you may be wondering can
you actually really personalize food is
this legit and so to answer that
question we took one of the most
notorious and arguably one of the most
delicious foods and put it to the test
bacon is it good or is it bad is it
friend Rousset foe and further answer
that question we looked at 1,400
people&#39;s response to a triglyceride a
macronutrient challenge beverage where
we looked at their triglyceride response
over a two-hour window and what we found
was that everybody processes fats
differently for those on the left-hand
side of the screen
they actually processed fats really well
it&#39;s really productive for them and they
can have a wider range of saturated and
unsaturated fats those on the right-hand
side of the screen actually have a much
harder time processing fats and as such
they really should stick to plant and
fish based fats said another way on the
left bacon is good but of course now
don&#39;t go crazy don&#39;t go whole hog on the
bacon here folks literally eat
responsibly but on the right hand side
we&#39;d recommend you swap the piece of
bacon for a slice of avocado toast now
for those on the extreme left or you
would say the far left
I actually recommend you sandwich those
two together in a BLT with avocado I
mean literally what could be better than
that now we do know that some folks on
the the far left are actually militant
vegans so we&#39;re gonna personalize this
one step further we&#39;re we&#39;re gonna swap
out the bacon for some tofurkey what do
you think guys so the second question
that we wanted to answer was can we
actually help people achieve their food
goals with a personalized nutrition plan
and to do that we actually created an
eight-week pilot study where we had 20
active participants and they had two
self-described goals the first one is
they wanted to lose weight but they
didn&#39;t want to go on a diet the second
one is they wanted to increase their
eating confidence and so with that
everyone went through first thing was a
at-home test kit were looked at 60
unique biomarkers from the DNA their
blood and their metabolism second thing
they got a personalized nutrition plan
that they could refer back to often on
their phone and on their desktop and
that all received one-on-one and group
coaching and we actually had some pretty
incredible findings the first was that
74% of people lost weight in an
eight-week period the second one
individual actually lost 18 pounds which
happens to be the rough equivalent of a
tire so he literally and figuratively
lost a spare tire around his waist very
proud of him and the third is that the
total group lost 78 pounds so now we&#39;ve
lost all four tires off the car now the
next set of learnings we got had to do
with change and eating behavior 56% said
they increased their non starchy
vegetable consumption 43% said they
decrease the sugary beverage consumption
and this one is quite remarkable
26% decrease their alcohol consumption
and given how crazy the world is right
now I think this one is absolutely
miraculous we should give them a hand
let&#39;s do it come on
these are actually amazing in all
seriousness these are amazing results
but the one I think that I&#39;m most proud
of is that 83% of folks
increase her eating confidence in social
and emotional eating situations folks
eating confidence is a very powerful
thing
take Kaitlyn she&#39;s a wife she&#39;s a mother
she&#39;s a cancer survivor for Kaitlyn
every food choice was like carrying the
weight of the world on her shoulders she
read she studied she asked every diet
nutrition book she could get her hands
on but after she got a personalized
nutrition plan she actually pulled all
of those books off the shelf laid him on
the floor snapped this photo posted it
and said no more she took all of those
boxed them up and shipped him to
Goodwill because you see for Kaitlyn it
was the first time she had confidence to
know what foods were actually right for
her imagine if you had Kaitlyn&#39;s
confidence navigating the thousands of
food choices in the grocery store
imagine being able to know what foods
are right for you on menus across the
country imagine being able to know that
every food you ate was nutrient dense
data rich and just right for you
so the next time you flip over a product
to see if it&#39;s something you should eat
I hope you moved past a
one-size-fits-all approach to one that&#39;s
highly personalized where you look
inside of yourself for the answer to the
question what foods are right for me
thank you
you
