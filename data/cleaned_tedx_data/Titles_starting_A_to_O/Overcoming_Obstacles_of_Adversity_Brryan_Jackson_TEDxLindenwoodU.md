what do you do when you&#39;re five years
old and sent home from the hospital with
only five months left to live what do
you do when you wake from a nightmare in
the middle of the night screaming please
don&#39;t let me die what do you do when the
man who gave you life tries to take it
away from you and not in a quick way
either tedx purpose is to share ideas
were spreading some of the those ideas
may see me but I&#39;ve came to realize that
there&#39;s nothing new Under the Sun those
old ideas can be a catalyst to propel us
towards a future a brighter future our
theme tonight is rise when I think of
rising I see this image of a mystical
creature known as a phoenix rising from
the ashes in life we&#39;re going to get
burned but all outcomes have the ability
to lead to renewal and joy I want to
talk to you about my perspective of
rising I want to talk about persevering
in 1995 I was that boy who woke up from
the hospital with the nightmares that
echoed screams into the next room the
doctors gave me five months to live
after diagnosing me with full-blown AIDS
sending me home with no hope the way I
became infected was heinous in itself my
own father intentionally injected me
with the HIV virus hoping I would die
off and he would never have to pay
tragically he is still saving the
license in prison but I was left to deal
with the virus that it restrains me
mentally emotionally physically and
socially what was meant to be my first
day of school I wasn&#39;t allowed to go to
school but finally my district caved
I was welcome to have an education but
with restrictions I couldn&#39;t drink from
the Rada fan
I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t use the restroom
and I could only come for half a day my
peers would run away from me in the
hallways like I had again call me names
like aids boy free they would quickly
remind me that I was wasted space and I
didn&#39;t belong there when I was in
seventh grade I suffered from physical
abuse at home and school this year even
got more devastating when I almost lost
my mother to a car accident what do you
do when the whole world is screaming
you&#39;re worthless and the one person
who&#39;s always believed in you can&#39;t be
there for you anymore in my moment of
desperation I wanted to escape one night
I had three knives in front of me I ask
myself what one can cut the deepest I
was ready to stop all the pain I was
tired of being wasted space and I just
wanted peace in my lowest moment I was
called to my Bible and I read the psalm
of David why so downcast O my soul puts
you a help and guide the word help begin
to waste curiosity it felt good to say
hope say with me 1 2 3 hope do I dare to
rise when life seems hopeless I found
out this that in life we come into this
world to be carried taking baby steps -
one step at a time and before you know
we&#39;re running and we have to take leaps
of faith but what guarantees us that
can make those leaves off we fast joy we
can get right back at the answer is hope
and who is vital hope is what reminds us
that in life that everything is going to
be okay a13 I realized when uh when bad
things happen to me I always asked why
is this happening to me I should do some
deep searching I realized I&#39;m asking the
wrong questions the question I need to
ask is why not me
you see life is full of suffering but
suffering produces perseverance of
perseverance produces character and
character produces hope and hope does
not fail everything we go through in
life has the ability to make us and
break us where we suffer we have the
ability to create the best person we can
be the grass isn&#39;t greener on the other
side of the fence it&#39;s greener where you
water we just have to ask you we want to
be part of the problem when you&#39;ve hide
the solution in other words do you want
to play the victim in your sale what do
you want victory the choice is eyes our
choice needs to be to rise because there
is hope the funny thing about choices
that we don&#39;t always get to choose
things a night like where we&#39;re from
where we grow up but some people don&#39;t
get the choice of what to wear or live
however we do get to choose the outcome
I begin to choose victory I chose to
trade my ashes for beauty I chose to
live a life because there is a plan and
a paper I chose to dare myself to become
something I chose to rise and make a
difference and I didn&#39;t stop there
a 16 I show his forgiveness I needed
elector the baggage and put it at God&#39;s
feet I forgave all those people in the
past you&#39;ve hit me I even forgave my
father my hell is completely strange in
this moment as I stand before you I&#39;m a
26 year old man who&#39;s happy and healthy
he was no longer battling HIV because it
is undetectable I&#39;ve been given hope to
have kids someday because I can&#39;t pass
on the value rising didn&#39;t stop there
it&#39;s just not a one-day decision after
years of going through physical or
mental tragedy I suffered from
depression to this day every day is a
batter to get up out of bed but there&#39;s
so much joy when I choose to push
through the struggle a man I was made to
rise every day we have the opportunity
to rise I don&#39;t believe in extraordinary
people I only believe in or ordinary
people who do extraordinary things and
I&#39;m going to show that to the world
daily more importantly I believe that
you can too after the duck stomach
stormy day comes a bright sunny day and
what do we get to do rise say it with me
storms aren&#39;t the problem it&#39;s a lack of
perception and I don&#39;t know about you
but when storms hit I often feel like
I&#39;m going to drag but then I realize I&#39;m
just too lazy to get up and white am I
on guiding can I get real with you
idea that that life can suck but it
doesn&#39;t have to suck a joy out of s
failure does not have to be fatal
our failure can have function if we are
willing to pay severe there&#39;s going to
be times a knife when you feel like
you&#39;ve been brought to your knees but
what you need to realize in this moment
is you only have one direction again and
that&#39;s their ass thank you
