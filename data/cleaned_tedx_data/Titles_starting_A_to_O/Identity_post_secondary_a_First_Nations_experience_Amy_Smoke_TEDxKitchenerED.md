say go so go go
I need tons e hello everybody
ladies Craig said my name is Amy spoke
Mohawk nation turtle clan and I&#39;m from
the Six Nations of the Grand River but I
grew up right here in Kitchener I was
born and raised right here in Kitchener
so I never lived on my reserve my
grandfather was Hyuga and he attended
the Mohawk Institute residential school
and my grandmother was mohawk and her
family lived in Hamilton and they had a
job and they went to church so it was
probably thought at the time that they
were already assimilated into mainstream
society so she and her siblings weren&#39;t
taking a residential school but both my
grandparents never really spoke the
language and didn&#39;t teach my mom and her
siblings my grandparents traveled back
and forth between six nations in the
United States because they were
following the work my grandfather was an
iron worker and they avoided those big
luxury cars pulling into the
neighborhoods for fear it was the social
service workers coming to take the
children away to residential school so
my mom was actually born in Detroit but
grew up here in six nations and she met
my father who&#39;s non-indigenous in
Brantford where he was born and they
moved to Kitchener Waterloo and where I
and my younger brother were born so I&#39;ve
never actually lived in six nations but
when I was growing up I you know mostly
around non-indigenous classmates and
neighbors I was very aware of how
different I look you know I have darker
skin different eyes and cheekbones and
as a result I was bullied quite a bit
when I was younger people would always
tell me to go back to where I came from
and I thought I was really weird because
I&#39;m from here and even my dad like my
dad would make comments about my mom and
ask kids about being Indians that we
were Indians and I was about five when I
asked him then what he was and he told
me he was a cowboy and I believed him I
actually told people that that&#39;s what my
dad was he was a cowboy so not being
around like any ceremonies or traditions
also not going to church or being
involved in any organized religion I
never had a chance to to learn any of
this you know my grandparents didn&#39;t
teach my mom and she never taught me so
I struggled I never really felt like I
fit in and by the time I was 11 I was
having suicidal thoughts by the time I
was 12 I was running away from home on a
regular basis it always seemed better to
me to live with someone else&#39;s family
than my own but my family made a nice
living in the computer industry we had a
big home and cars and summer vacations
so I wanted for nothing really
materially again I just I didn&#39;t feel
like I fit in so I started to use drugs
and I partied my way through high school
and eventually dropped out but I applied
to college as a mature student because
like that&#39;s what you do after high
school right you go to college but the
soft drugs turned to harsher ones and
two days after my 22nd birthday I found
myself at a healing lodge in Toronto and
it was for indigenous people only and it
was a four-month live in treatment and I
remember walking through those doors and
I I smelled that sage the smudge and I
heard the drums and I started listening
to the teachings and I thought wow like
how did I not know any of this before
why weren&#39;t people talking about this
cuz like it was so logical for me like
it was just you know made sense so I
knew that this was the spirituality the
identity that I had been searching for I
knew that I had come home but I was kind
of young and kind of silly and I broke
the biggest rule in treatment never get
involved with somebody while you&#39;re
working on yourself especially somebody
in the same treatment program and once
we graduated I moved out with this
beautiful young Cree man and we
attempted to live a sober life in
Toronto but we struggled and it all came
to a head one night
drugs and alcohol ended in this big
bloody mess and I moved back home to
Kitchener unfortunately I didn&#39;t seek
out any indigenous organizations in my
area you know like I thought what I
learned in the lodge was I&#39;m hoping
enough and I rekindled an old
high-school romance and I got pregnant
with my first daughter and I for nearly
five years was
Super Mom right I read every parenting
book and magazine that there was because
I was determined to do this one thing
right but again I started to slip I was
struggling and I started sending my
daughter to my parents house for
overnights visits and and weekend visits
and one day she just didn&#39;t come home I
was also working at the stag shop at the
time so it was a very adult life which
came with very adult drugs without my
daughter like to be responsible for and
get up in the morning for and take care
of I lost it I completely set out slid
out of control within three months I had
found another unhealthy partner lost my
daughter lost my job lost my apartment
and this started the next five years of
how I entered the world of IV drugs
opiates and heroin My partner and I
would steal from stores all day long and
then we would sell it and buy drugs get
a hotel room party all night never
saving anything for the morning right
when we would be like in severe
withdrawal I found myself getting in
trouble with the law
and every few months I was in and out of
jail we couch surfed I slept in crack
houses we broke into cars to sleep I
spent a summer in a tent at Bingaman
Park and again I did things I never
thought I would do I exploited myself
and other women this was not anything I
had ever grown up around nothing I
imagined possible
well eventually applied for social
assistance and one of the requirements
to stay eligible for the benefits is you
have to take these courses one of them
was called focus for change and I knew
like two three weeks into the program
why it was named so because I was tired
I was tired of running and going to jail
and sticking needles in myself I was
tired of the abusive relationships so I
called a woman shelter and I made the
plan to flee and I checked into a
methadone clinic I applied for a
subsidized housing I got my apartment
and the fog started to lift and I was
able to get up every morning and not
need the drugs
and I knew I was gonna need some more
education because not only did I finish
that program but I then I read I did my
GED as well but I knew I was gonna need
more I reapplied to that program I had
started like 15 years prior and I got to
the campus and I walked into the
aboriginal services office which was new
at the time and I met the most wonderful
man
wonderful teacher I&#39;d ever known and I
explained I&#39;d missed some deadlines for
funding and he said he just stood up and
he walked me down to the OSAP office and
he said let&#39;s just get you here now and
we&#39;ll worry about paying it back later
and like the fact that he used the term
we and like complete unconditional
acceptance from this total stranger
reminded me of that that healing Lodge
and the people that I had been around so
I knew that I had once again found my
home so I jumped in to college I started
talking in classes about like smudging
and what it was like to be a First
Nation student and a mature student and
the coordinator of my program suggested
that I go out for a photo shoot for the
marketing campaign you know what you do
here counts out there I found myself on
one of those like life-size banners I
was in like a website and on a
commercial and proShares and like the
drug addict in me like didn&#39;t think that
that was even remotely possible so I
began to feel really comfortable and
accepted but I knew I was gonna need
more education right I wanted more
education so I applied to university and
I got to campus and I thought where all
the indigenous students like it just
come from a college where we had
ceremonies and powers and traditional
teachings sweat lodges and I was really
disappointed to find out that there were
like five First Nations in 18 Inuit
students that used their aboriginal
services I thought what am I going to do
here so they took another deep breath
and I jumped right in again i
reactivated the indigenous Student
Association and I applied for funds for
some marketing materials started making
our presence known on campus today our
Center sees like two dozen regularily
indigenous students using the services
we feed like over a hundred of the
campus community during our weekly Supan
frybread lunches
and when I finished my first degree
actually I was given the president of
the term award so I finished it I just
actually finished my second degree in
June my convocation is actually next
month so why did I share all that with
you like I spent more than half my time
with you just introducing myself um
not only as a mohawk person I am a
talker I&#39;m a storyteller but as an
indigenous person this is a huge
cultural value for us we explain who we
are where we come from in our social
location and our history that&#39;s
important to us and I need people to
know when I walk through those doors
especially a classroom that I come with
that history the beauty the pain the
intergenerational trauma and healing I
come with all of it the collective
history and blood memory of the
indigenous people of Turtle Island and
as a stronger and healthier First
Nations person it&#39;s my job now to help
you find their culture and and know
their history and understand their
identity you know cuz I walked into
those spaces of healing and learning I
was home and I felt such balance and
belonging and it&#39;s like such an honor to
be able to help others find that same
pride and acceptance within themselves
like there&#39;s just no greater job so how
do we indigenized academic spaces or
better yet to colonize them I found as a
student you know I&#39;m an indigenous
person we like circles we do everything
in circles
we like to face each other on an even
level we&#39;re all teachers and learners
but I find it really troubling that
nobody wanted to move the desks and rows
into into a circle and I found this
really unsettling and I start to
question what I was learning like as to
its cultural relevance how does this
work for indigenous people how can I use
this with indigenous people and I was
met with rolling eyes and size of like
what see me gonna say now I think we
always can talk about being Native Amy
needs to calm down a little bit and in a
school of social work in particular
subjects like anti-oppressive theory and
in did
knowledge queer and feminist theory were
like the last subjects to be taught I
really thought that was weird like who
did we think that we would be out there
in the world with once we had our little
degrees in our hands and a teacher once
asked me to share my story so she asked
me to share a little bit of my story a
First Nations perspective a little bit
of the history and colonization but
while I was a student in the class and
the systemic racism and discrimination
felt by First Nations may teen Inuit
students is current it&#39;s not historical
this is like our everyday lived reality
so having me explain colonization while
I currently experience it was not really
an okay place for me to be I know it
wasn&#39;t intended to harm me I&#39;m a talker
but I realize now that that&#39;s not a safe
space so how do we make safer spaces
it&#39;s like for indigenous students too I
mean it&#39;s already impossible to fully
prepare an indigenous student for
university considering the inequities of
funding for on-reserve schools versus
provincial schools but we also need to
prepare the universities for for
indigenous students we need to look at
other ways of learning and teaching and
knowing and being in the world because
we are the fastest growing population in
Canada right forty-seven percent of us
are under the age of 25 you&#39;re gonna see
us you&#39;re gonna work with us you&#39;re
gonna educate us so I think we need to
create some space for the not only the
knowledge that they can bring to the
classroom but maybe not that they won&#39;t
bring to the classroom invite indigenous
elders and knowledge keepers into your
spaces academics professionals doctors
lawyers scientists we have them all and
I really think it&#39;s time we started
speaking for ourselves right nothing
about us without us one of my favorite
phrases so again these are big scary
words right decolonization and in
digitization and reconciliation my
advice is as an indigenous person I&#39;m
tired you know I&#39;m tired I&#39;m healing
myself and my family and
communities and our nation&#39;s but we&#39;re
also expected to educate everybody about
us at the same time so we need you to to
like meet us halfway do the research
help educate yourself but come to our
spaces come share our spaces with us and
invite us into yours we are all about
interconnectedness right so make some
meaningful connections engage with us I
care I&#39;m gonna tell you you won&#39;t regret
it
we&#39;re awesome people we&#39;re hilarious
we&#39;re funny people were generous we&#39;re
giving and you just will not regret it
but again make those meaningful
connections we&#39;re all about the
interconnectedness we&#39;re all about the
relationships we&#39;re all about story time
so thank you share your stories with us
like I&#39;ve shared mine here with you guys
all tonight
thank you so much yeah I&#39;ll go ten
minutes go with it now
