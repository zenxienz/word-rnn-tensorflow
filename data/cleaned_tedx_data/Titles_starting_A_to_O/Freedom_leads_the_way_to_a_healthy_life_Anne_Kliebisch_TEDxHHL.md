welcome to the journey of freedom and a
healthy life before we start let me ask
you a question if you take a scale from
one to ten like one being the lowest ten
being the highest how stressed are you
today or this week
and in your life in general
and how do you feel with this number
when I talk to people about this usually
they say like an eight or higher and
when I ask them what it&#39;s all about they
usually say well I feel like I&#39;m not
good enough they tend to want to be
faster and better and even perfect and
every since and what we notice is stress
is one of the most risky disease
symptoms or causes for diseases that
means we can have physical diseases from
that heart attacks we even age faster or
we can have psychological diseases and
depression of is one of this the World
Health Organization told us that 300
million people are affected by
depression 300 million people is the
whole population of the United States
this is enormous when I started my first
job I noticed that I was stressed and
when I talked to people they just said
yeah well me too
and it was like a status here&#39;s my job
my car and my stress level and I
wondered why is that and at some point I
realized for myself my stress came from
my current situation where I am right
now
and where I wanted to be because I had
so many dreams that I didn&#39;t and I
didn&#39;t know how to follow them and when
I pictured myself in this job that I had
taken and I was where I just got
promoted and thought the next three
years the next five years or the neck
ten years it just didn&#39;t feel right to
stay and at the same time they promised
all the right things a good salary an
excellent career security all for the
future everything your parents want from
you once for you and it&#39;s a really tough
decision go for the safety or do I go
for the hundred percent scientists at
the Max Planck Institute found out that
we are empathetic beings that&#39;s pretty
cool so when I&#39;m stressed and you watch
me you have the same stress symptoms as
me and the same stress hormones but the
good news about it is that if we infect
each other with stress we can also
infect each other with happiness and
freedom and I wanted to get to the root
cause of this happiness and freedom and
I found a solution in a really
unexpected area this is Mark he has a
chronicle disease mobos corn as a
stomach disease his blood inflammation
rate was 20 times higher than normal I
don&#39;t know if you know what it feels
like he can&#39;t eat a lot of stuff anymore
he feels weak sometimes it even hurts I
mean food that&#39;s supposed to be good for
your body and vitalize now destroys your
intestines
in 2014 he participated in an experiment
and he won basic income that is 1000
euros for 12 months and at the time he
realized he had won this money and there
were no strings attached he didn&#39;t owe
anyone
anything he could watch his body heal
and from week to week within seven weeks
his blood inflammation read dropped to a
normal level and it&#39;s not just about the
money the money didn&#39;t heal him but we
what he experienced was dropping his
existential fear and experiencing
existential relaxation mine Gordon come
or my basic income is this experiment we
collect from almost half a million
people money and then as long we collect
from half a million people money until
we have 12,000 euros and then we just
give it out to someone with that we have
distributed or raffled out money to over
100 people so far and we learned a lot
about these stories this young man of
nine years is Robin and he won a basic
income as well and I don&#39;t know if you
can imagine what happened but this boy
what became from one day to another a
major earner in his family and it
changed the whole dynamic the family
said they didn&#39;t fight this much they
spend more time they made a lot of trips
even though Robin just wanted one book
every month from this money and what his
mom said well what changed for us is not
what we did it&#39;s how we did it we just
spent our time more consciously we see
how basic income or this feeling of
freedom can ripple out to a lot more
people for example our family
and Robin footed just think like well
basic income just makes us better
feelings when he&#39;s in the third story is
justa she is a self-employed woman with
a kid and the worst nightmare she could
experience as if her kid got sick
because if she doesn&#39;t work she doesn&#39;t
earn money and if the kid is sick she
can&#39;t work and can&#39;t earn money and she
came back to this existential fear and
she suffered from giving her child the
impression that sick is like doing
something wrong when she wasn&#39;t one
basic income she not only could stay at
home
she also rippled it out to a lot of
other people because she thought they
should experience the same thing and she
decided to make pay what you want
concept with her clients because she
wanted everyone to realize what it&#39;s
worth what they&#39;re doing based on
quality and sympathy and not on a price
tag and we&#39;re so known and so it&#39;s so
common for us to be worth what we earn
and to work really hard to be worth
something
and she wanted to destroy this cycle and
make it to something bigger what we
learned from the stories and like all
the different other stories is this
ripple from me to my close surrounding
like a family to even an ecosystem of
trust and we&#39;ve been doing this for the
past three years I said we have already
ruffled out to over a hundred people
this basic income and what is not the
same in every
is that they say they feel a lot more
self-esteem when they go back to work
they feel a lot less stressed in their
overall life and what we didn&#39;t
experience is that people would leave
their jobs usually if you ask someone
would you continue working and the
majority of people says yeah well I
would and for us in our experiment only
four people quit their jobs three
because they didn&#39;t like it and they
wanted to change what they did and want
to go and study and we can learn from
the stories with winners of basic income
we have detected like three phases which
I even went through when I was thinking
of quitting my job and the first is
acknowledge dependency when you first
win this money they all say the same I&#39;m
so pressured I have to do something for
the crowd I mean they gave me this money
for free I owe them something when I
thought of quitting my job my first
thought was I can&#39;t take unemployment
benefits I want to give something to the
community and not take something out of
it but the truth is we are dependent and
this will not change this is effect and
it&#39;s it&#39;s strengthening us which leads
directly to the next one tolerate your
freedom we noticed that a lot of times
friends would tell the winners why don&#39;t
you just take the money and do what&#39;s
good for you right now what is it that
you really really want to do and when I
first experienced this freedom of taking
unemployment benefits
I noticed I had a lot more ideas and I
didn&#39;t consume as much as if I didn&#39;t
have to compensate for anything and it&#39;s
a common story around all of our winners
as well the third phase is self
responsible freedom our society tends to
skip the first two phases and jump right
into this one and this is nonsense
because because of this credit of trust
that you have been given something
bigger can grow and we noticed that I
had more ideas I did them I was asking
myself so how can it make this freedom
than I experience and bring it into my
work life and bring it into other
people&#39;s work life this is how basic
income my basic income this experiment
has started because of this phase this
is what made just I think how can I grow
and give other people this freedom as
well because we&#39;re so we still think we
can earn and purchase freedom but we can
only live it so if you take nothing but
one thing then I would say it&#39;s this
basic income feeling this deep inner
freedom can start with you and can start
with you asking yourself and your
friends what would you do if your income
was taken care of and imagine what kind
of society would look we would live in
if we could go for the freedom and the
things that are right for us right now
and it can start with you
I wish us all the best of luck for that
