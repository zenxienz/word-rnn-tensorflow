[Music]
little boy don&#39;t act like home don&#39;t put
your hands on your hips like why you
gotta be sensitive you gotta man up
better show you&#39;re not
good boy it doesn&#39;t dance around like
don&#39;t be sweet cuz they&#39;ll treat you
like how will we ever learn to treat a
woman with all due respect he is not at
all as rough as his beard as tight as
the muscles on his bones when he was a
little boy he was soft like those
whispers he danced light-footed on the
surface of mother earth like he was
giving her butterfly kisses on her cheek
but those whispers always made the boy
lose the groove in his steps cuz he
internalized those whispers as loud
screams screaming a halt every time his
steps were to light his arms means to
free when he couldn&#39;t get rid of that
damn dip in his left hip when his tone
was too sweet
he wondered why there was no bass to his
feet we&#39;ll see the bass always felt like
it was more of a man that he thought he
could never find in himself and since
those whispers never sang along to that
slightly feminine song the boy lost
in the melody watching Walter Booker
play the bass takes me back in time two
bass players I knew in my precocious
prime the mahogany shaman is strumming
his stuff each one in a erogenous zone
straight ahead momentum building that
cat is on a roll I must look a way to
listen if the volume II can&#39;t ignore a
nature in history when it&#39;s transpiring
before my eyes that bass has been around
the world to tell the tale with her
stately back proud patina so toss the
cliches aside envision manner is
timeless photograph of Lee Miller with
the tracings of a violin along her torso
Booker is smoking cocaine full speed
ahead
a cat&#39;s on a roll he seizes his views
brutally tenderly as if the vibrations
worked enough the band keeps play but
Booker&#39;s struck a chord he makes me feel
like a girl pretty well he makes me feel
something
Lord do I give him that part of me I&#39;m
not like Eve when I offered him
chocolate
[Music]
heart is like an island to the sea and
the Sun comes up the morning dew smiling
in the garden
[Music]
my heart&#39;s an open record so without a
pain task without don&#39;t it&#39;s not over
you have been looking for
[Music]
feminine what is female intuition heal
your way to knowing the privilege to
grow older to know that you&#39;re feeling
led you along this path to your heart
slip and slide without a guide guess
what you are your best mentor guided in
your dreams the only task you have is to
awaken
I opened Facebook and it said hashtag me
too hashtag me too and hashtag me too we
speak our minds and I wonder what it
might lead to I tell my girlfriend and
my friends you I see you yelling we need
to make the change and I agree too
yet I wonder if it matters if I retweet
you every warrior bleeds juice like a
beat boot but my sister kind of publicly
acknowledged that she pleads to let me
ask you when you&#39;re walking down the
street do you see a bathroom what if my
sister needs to be too because yo I see
better people struggle with things I can
use through and it&#39;s because of their
behavior
we teach dude so next time you&#39;re in
traffic and a Brady girl passes by I
would ask you kindly not to comment on
her ass and steer clear of any form of
harassment even if your t-shirt is
see-through made it be noted and
repeated that sex is not an achievement
especially if it ain&#39;t something she
agreed to though I appreciate you
listening to me
you should check out sometimes these
they put their stories to a beep - I&#39;m
encouraging my girls and my boys to take
up the pieces children of Allah or of
Jesus to bribe patriarchy by the penis
be it with physical force or with
telekinesis we can only be pissed if we
believe that it can be defeated by
helping each other smash it to pieces we
may begin to build the bond that is
needed to overcome so man woman and
everyone in between can finally get a
taste of this freedom
don&#39;t I know you there she is again
right in front of me when I brush my
teeth looking in the mirror I recognize
her green eyes tell no lies
this face ever-changing the comfort of
another day sometime I will go through
the looking-glass brave like Alice when
this image self is gone and my soul free
your shame and blame diatribe with an
attempt to set me in flames
except that I&#39;m fire proof enough of the
combustible criticism flama Tory
commentary I&#39;m immune to all of your
magics and Zippo lighter pyrotechnics
because I&#39;m fire proof invulnerable to
being a set aflame on your pyre of guilt
in infamy don&#39;t you get it I need your
Joan of Arc as a granddaughter of the
60s feminist movement my vanity was
slayed with scorn self-love and
femininity nipped in the bud mothers and
grandmothers freed themselves from the
burden of womanhood leaving me with one
example will be a man if you want to
make it in this world
[Music]
little boy donut lag I&#39;m the girl that
avoids her reflection in shame counts
the dimples in her flesh knows all her
imperfections by name 2017 while gender
equality and sexual harassment demand
our attention again we all obliviously
embrace a new mistake the ideal image of
a woman is no longer in the hands of
male domination we set our own standards
now and all desperately strive to meet
them get that killer body trained that
ass lip fillers at 20 you are worth it
girl let&#39;s seal the taboo of aging
forever and break the taboo of Botox
instead brave are the girls that in
YouTube tutorials share their makeup
knowledge with the world exposing their
suffocated skin like a scarred and
eroded canvas be a man
[Music]
and in the white in the rain
be a witness
[Music]
our mothers balancing ambition and
family with the needs of a perfect
[Music]
redirected nurturer snails holding space
for world potential eager for change we
wonder who our robots are and if we
close our eyes and listen we can hear
the goddess waking up from her beauty
sleep and enlighten our souls with
memories of our pre gender bodies
[Applause]
