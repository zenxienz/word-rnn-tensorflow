hello my name is Luke Montauban and
today I&#39;m gonna talk to you about how
mosquitoes can save the world
okay so mosquitoes they&#39;re extremely
annoying raise your hand if you&#39;ve ever
felt that annoying sensation of the
mosquito bite yeah pretty much everyone
in here so what if I told you I found
out a way to combat that so to be able
to do this first I need to get you a bit
of background about mosquito bites in
general so the salivary glands inside
the mosquito decreed their saliva that
goes into the bloodstream and causes the
blood to clot and when this is done the
the area and the skin gets very swollen
red and itchy so basically it&#39;s cause
and effect with the salivary glands and
the mosquito you get the red Ichi well
without them you get no well at all
so that brings me to my next topic how
to get rid of diseases so here are a few
diseases that might I do that I&#39;ll tell
you later
we&#39;ll get rid of pretty much malaria
zika dengue yellow fever and many other
diseases so here&#39;s a bit of proof of
concept about my idea so my idea is
mosquito forms and there are already
some mosquito farms in the world and
China Japan in a few other countries in
Asia so but we&#39;re I will Accord them is
in a few different areas but let me
bring you to an interesting topic about
mosquitoes they get infected with the
virus because it&#39;s airborne infects them
and then they somehow are able to live
with that disease
long enough to affect a rodent and
animal or human and if we figure out how
they do this we can find out how humans
ourselves can do it and that in turn
will give us immunity to the disease so
let me tell you again what I&#39;m going to
do I&#39;m going to raise the mosquitoes in
captivity from birth then I will keep
raising them but I&#39;ll add a disease to
them or a virus or something that will
get them immune from getting that virus
at all so then they won&#39;t even have the
just virus to begin with but once you do
that they will not be able to infect
humans with this virus and it will be
amazing but also we only have to do this
to the females because the females are
the only type of sub mosquitoes that
bite this is an evolutionary behavior
because the mosquitoes need their blood
meal to raise their infants and babies
okay so this is where we will put the
mosquito farms one area in Paraguay
right below Brazil Brazil rainforest
area if you have ever camped out in a
rainforest or gone hiking in one you
will know how annoying mosquitoes are
you&#39;re always picking up on you and just
being extremely obnoxious so if we put
one in Paraguay they&#39;ll allow the
workers to release the mosquitoes into
Brazil and then once they do this
hopefully we can save lots of lives
there the next area the biggest hitter
this is like an amazing area to put it
Libya okay everyone knows what continent
Libya is on Africa so Africa huge area
for tons of mosquito borne viruses so if
we put one in Libya we will be able to
save millions of lives so if you look at
the chart
in the red areas it&#39;s over a million
confirmed cases of malaria and there is
quite a few countries in Africa that are
fully red so once again if we put them
in Libya we can save more than a million
lives in fact more than a million lives
people that is crazy
and in another area Nepal directly above
India if you have ever visited India
mosquitoes are knowing they&#39;re once
again always picking up on you and being
obnoxious and it&#39;s also over a million
confirmed cases of malaria are in India
so if we put one in Nepal we can once
again save a million lives that is
amazing and in conclusion after all the
research I have done I believe this idea
will work and as humans we are able to
incorporate this into every day life to
the fact where the next generations
after us may even not know what malaria
for Zika are that would be amazing
thank you
