my talk actually from space and not just
close to the earth in space but actually
four billion miles away from the earth
in space and this particular image that
I&#39;m showing you was taken by the Voyager
1 spacecraft looking back at the earth
although it&#39;s a very coarse resolution
image I&#39;m starting with it because I
think it&#39;s amazing to think that we have
these images the and it&#39;s called the
blue dot because as you can see and you
should be able to see it up there the
earth looks like a blue dot four million
miles away and and so this is my my
starting point but most of the data I
deal with is actually from much closer
to the earth and so we&#39;re now gonna very
much zoom in to the type of images I
look at every day and I have to say I&#39;m
very privileged to look at these images
because I think they&#39;re absolutely
stunning and this couple of images I&#39;m
showing you now are from a series called
the Blue Marble and the most recent
images are collected from a satellite
called Vyas their is orbiting just above
the earth and as the Earth rotates Fears
comes around in a polar orbit and so
it&#39;s taking scans of imagery and what
NASA done in these particular examples
is stitched all those images together to
create you a full global view and this
view is at one kilometer resolution
which is why you can see so much detail
in it and they&#39;re pre big to download
from the internet I have to say but
they&#39;re all freely available and out
there so you can go on NASA&#39;s website
and pick these up and what you can see
from these images is what we sort of
expect from from the Blue Marble view
and we see the clouds in white we see
the oceans
in blue and we see the land in a mixture
of brown and green depending on how much
vegetation is growing and is active and
you might also see some vertical stripes
on these images and that&#39;s actually Sun
glint so that&#39;s where the Sun is hitting
the surface of the ocean and bouncing
off so I&#39;m going to start now with the
participants questions and we&#39;ll see how
this works so I&#39;m going to ask you what
you think you can see from space so I&#39;m
gonna take the example of a satellite
called Sentinel 2 and this is from a
recent set of satellites there are
European satellites and have have been
launched over the last few years it&#39;s at
an altitude of almost 800 kilometers and
it has a pixel size of 15 meters and so
what do you think you could see from
that could you see the Great Wall of
China could you see a house could you
see anything that&#39;s bigger than that
pixel size or does it not actually
matter what size the object is as to
whether you can see it so this is I
think where you should now all be using
your mobile phones and giving me some
sort of poll about oh that&#39;s good
so I think the audience has got the
answer right I think so the answer is
you can see all these things from space
it really depends on the the pixel
resolution but actually it also doesn&#39;t
because what I where I&#39;m gonna spend
most this talk talking about is plankton
and actually they&#39;re microscopic and we
can see them from space which i think is
an amazing thing so I&#39;m gonna carry on
though so what I&#39;m doing now is I&#39;m
unfurling my globe so if you think of
your globe it&#39;s this 3d structure but to
see a map what we need is it&#39;s like
peeling an orange you need to take the
peel off and flatten it so that you can
lay it flat on the tape
and traditionally this is how we&#39;ve
looked at imagery although although it
is changing to more 3d views and that&#39;s
because we we tended to have in the past
flat TV screens or flat maps and this is
in a particular projection called a
Mercator map projection and it has
artifacts within it because we&#39;ve
unfurled that 3d structure and put it
flat and so your countries like Africa
appear much smaller in proportion to
countries further north or sense so
often you compare Africa and Greenland
which you don&#39;t get a true
representation of on on this particular
map projection but it&#39;s a nice way to
start because what I&#39;m gonna do next is
I&#39;m now gonna peel the atmosphere away
and the reason why the ocean looks blue
is primarily the atmosphere 90% of the
signal is actually coming from
scattering in the atmosphere rather than
the signal from the oceans itself and so
when I start to peel that their
atmosphere away what we start to see is
the color of the ocean and I&#39;m taking
the land away as well because that&#39;s
relatively bright compared to the ocean
and you can now see shades of colors so
in the deep ocean which we call the
ocean gyres you&#39;re seeing the blue but
to the north and south you&#39;re seeing
this green coloration and this is our
phytoplankton are microscopic plants
living in the ocean and this is a color
composite so we&#39;re using bands
approximately red green and blue to show
you what it would be like to have
something like a color photo taken from
space what I&#39;m next gonna change to is a
chlorophyll map so what what we do with
that is we actually then apply some
mathematics and we calculate the
concentration of the the green pigment
the chlorophyll in the plankton and then
we can show that as about and I&#39;m going
to show you the annual time series and
so this is gonna run as a slow animation
so you can see it
what I will point out at the start is
you&#39;ll see the northern and southern
extents moving and this is because we&#39;re
moving through the seasons so as you
move into the winter in the northern
hemisphere it gets darker earlier in the
day and so the satellite can see less
imagery when it when it goes over
there&#39;s not so much light for it to get
a signal back form I&#39;ll in the southern
hemisphere you&#39;ll be getting brighter
but as we move from the winter and we&#39;re
now it December with through the spring
then you&#39;ll start to see the green
increasing and this is the spring bloom
so the the plankton in the ocean are
like the plants on earth as the light
starts to increase in the spring they
start growing and multiplying and
blooming and you get more activity going
on in the oceans and so we&#39;ve stopped on
April and so you can see if you look
between the UK and America you can see
it&#39;s quite green and this is our North
Atlantic spring bloom in action if I
start to to zoom in then we can see a
bit closer what&#39;s going on around the UK
and the coastline and what you should be
able to see is that around the coast
we&#39;re also greener than we are in the
open ocean and this is again because we
tend to get an upwelling of nutrients at
the coastline and particularly near the
UK you&#39;ll see this strong line around
the UK and that is called the
continental shelf and that&#39;s where we go
from the deep ocean to the much
shallower ocean and the plankton
particularly liked to live there because
there&#39;s a lot of whaling and turbulence
in the water and what you&#39;re seeing over
Africa is not some strange artifact but
is actually a plankton this is a
phytoplankton Sealand or a microscope so
what I&#39;m showing you here is these two
views you&#39;ve got the view of the
phytoplankton 800 kilometers away in
space and in parallel you&#39;ve got the
view of the plankton under a microscope
what it looks like and I think both look
wonderful and show you just how amazing
these creatures are and they&#39;re really
important for life on Earth so a third
of known species live in the ocean and
these phytoplankton are the basis of
that food chain so the plants the
phytoplankton are eaten by the animals
the zooplankton who in turn were beaten
by the fish and then by us and other
animals also because they&#39;re plants they
take in carbon dioxide and so a third of
the carbon dioxide is also taken up by
the ocean and then put back out as
oxygen so they&#39;re controlling the amount
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the
atmosphere as well and as the amount of
carbon dioxide increases you can also
get problems in the ocean because it
becomes more obsidian
due to the absorption of carbon dioxide
so this is a really important ecosystem
that we often don&#39;t know about because
if we were on a boat we just see this
this blue ocean and so I am now going to
zoom in a bit further and start to look
at some further detail so so far I&#39;ve
been using global imagery and they are
also composite so I&#39;m taking ten years
of data and adding it together so you
didn&#39;t see any clouds but we also have
much higher resolution imagery and this
is from the satellite Sentinel too
so whereas before the data I was showing
you was a four kilometer pixel size so
four by four kilometer for each point
this is now 15 meter pixel size and what
you can see again I&#39;ve I&#39;ve stripped
away the atmosphere is there again we
can see the wonder of what&#39;s going on
within the ocean so I very much had to
saturate the land because it&#39;s very much
brighter so you can see this but you can
now see this wonderful
combination of physics and biology
creating these amazing patterns and this
is just off Scotland the Outer Hebrides
this is where this is occurring you
might also see some some artifacts in
the imagery as well and that&#39;s because
Sentinel 2 is not really designed for
looking at the oceans it&#39;s more designed
for looking at the land so there are
some diagonal stripes like this which is
effect of the scanner and you might also
see some lines like this and if you look
carefully you&#39;ll see some white lines
and it if you&#39;re very careful and if it
shows up well on this screen you might
see a shadow and that&#39;s contrails in the
atmosphere so I&#39;ve not managed to move
everything of the atmosphere here
because if we have a cloud we actually
can&#39;t see underneath it so we&#39;re gonna
zoom back out again because I don&#39;t want
to only show you optical data but I also
want to show you another another form of
remote sensing and this is an image from
the Sentinel one satellite and so this
is a sister satellite you could call it
a sentinel 2 there are all part of a
european program called Copernicus and
the Sentinel one satellite is also of a
similar spatial resolution 20 meters so
we&#39;re looking now at the Dutch coast and
you can see the land because again it&#39;s
very much brighter and you can see
fields and other infrastructure on the
land but hopefully you should also be
able to see things going on in the ocean
as well and so up above my head if you
look very carefully you will see some
clusters are very small quite faint dots
and there are actually two sets of wind
farms and you can actually really zoom
in on this imagery and start to almost
see the blades on those wind farms and
the bigger dots going across the screen
our boat so vessels at sea so what what
the satellite imagery allows us to do is
not only look
the plankton which are the basis of the
food chain but also to look at human
activities as well the blue economy we
can see what&#39;s going on on the surface
of the ocean and one of the impressive
things about microwave data is it sees
through clouds so for this data we can
look at any weather conditions because
we&#39;re not blocked by our plant so this
is a wonderful resource but I have to
say we can&#39;t use it on its own we can&#39;t
say we only do satellite remote sensing
you also have to do modelling and
measurements from boats as well and so
for my example of ground-based
measurements I&#39;m going to show you a
citizen science program and this is the
the sekki disk project that has been
running since 2003
the NOFA key disc is a white disk that&#39;s
lowered into the ocean until it
disappears and you just measure how deep
that that measurement is and then that
tells you how turbid the water is and by
doing that we start to get a view also
from the ground about what&#39;s happening
in the ocean and then I&#39;m going to
finish off with something that&#39;s very
much in the news at the minute and
that&#39;s microplastics
because I&#39;m sure many of you don&#39;t own
boats and they&#39;re not going to go out
into the ocean and take measurements but
we all have an impact on the ocean
whether it is positive or negative and
this is very much something where we&#39;re
all putting plastics into the ocean
either because we&#39;re using Makeup or
other things that contain the little
balls that go down the sink and out the
sewers or we&#39;re leaving rubbish on the
beach and that&#39;s ending up in the ocean
and ultimately being eaten by fish and
other animals and potentially coming
back to us as well as that as the food
we eat
so alongside seeing the ocean is a
wonderful thing we also have to look
after it and that that&#39;s a
responsibility of everyone so I&#39;d like
to thank you very much for for listening
to this
and if I hope you very much enjoyed the
presentation
[Applause]
