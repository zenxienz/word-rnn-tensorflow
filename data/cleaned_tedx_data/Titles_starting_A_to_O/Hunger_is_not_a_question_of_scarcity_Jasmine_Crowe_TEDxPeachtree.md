I want to take you back to a hot summer
day in July of 2015 and tell you about
the day that I saw the light my college
roommate
Savannah who had worked as a successful
celebrity makeup artist traveling the
world with the likes of Alicia Keys
Paula Abdul and zendaya decided with her
husband that they would relocate from
New York City to Atlanta and chase the
American dream they wanted to own a home
and give their children a life they
never knew growing up like being able to
play in a backyard
and write a school bus to school so they
moved to the peach day and one day I
visited their home and as she and I said
in her kitchen catching up about all the
good times we had in college and
laughing at pictures are the many wrong
outfit choices we selected she offered
me a glass of water and when she opened
her refrigerator door I could
immediately see from the front to the
back as she turned around she now saw
the shocked look in my eyes and she
stood there pregnant with her second
child and burst into tears telling me
that she knew what I was thinking and
that while she always tried to keep
meals and snacks in the house for her
two-year-old son often they didn&#39;t have
the money to and what I remember most
about that day was this bright light
shining in my eyes from this empty
refrigerator this is the day that hunger
became deeply personal to me I was
shocked at one of my friends someone who
had to fight all the odds was a face of
hunger Savannah was college educated
well-traveled had led a successful
career and married the love of her life
she simply fell on hard times which
could happen to anyone
perhaps what hurt worst is that she was
too embarrassed to tell me that she
didn&#39;t have food for her unborn child in
her young son her plight is not uncommon
in this country nationwide tonight
one out of seven people will go to bed
hungry we have 42 million people living
in food insecure households and what&#39;s
worse is that every month like my friend
they have to make a critical decision
having to choose between paying for
bills and paying for food this is a
problem no one should ever have to
decide if food is a necessity in their
household yet they do and it&#39;s happening
every day in fact I believe that just
like me each of you knows someone who is
or has experienced hunger at some point
in their life whether you know it or not
fighting hunger has always been an
important cause to me
I&#39;ve been invested in the fight since
2013 when I first moved to Atlanta while
driving through downtown I stumbled
across an area of hundreds of people
outside I noticed that many of them were
sitting on the sidewalk eating something
shook me to my core in that moment and I
was moved to do something so I created
an event called Sunday soul an
opportunity for members of our homeless
community to enjoy a delicious Sunday
dinner paired with some good old school
R&amp;B music Mike I read the Franklin the
Jackson 5 Marvin Gaye Patti LaBelle
James Brown you know the music made
perfect for a Sunday afternoon Mike al
Green&#39;s loving happiness and I remember
my first feeding like it was yesterday
Sunday October 20th 2013 we served a
spaghetti dinner simple with corn garlic
bread and a salad and we sang and we
danced and for that moment in time
people forgot about their current
circumstances on that day we fed just a
hundred people but over the years that
number would grow to well over 400 and
while I was proud of the work that we
were doing I wanted more for those that
we served so I created the Sunday soul
pop-up restaurant and I&#39;m ready tables
and chairs and linens and I brought out
fresh flowers and allowed our guests to
sit down
and dine with dignity as they enjoyed
of course meal that they ordered from a
menu and I took this initiative all
across the country to cities like
Washington DC New Orleans in Baltimore
and it was when a video from one of
these events went viral that I had my
aha moment as I scrolled through the
thousands of comments on Facebook
amongst the praise there was one
reoccurring question which restaurants
donated the food sadly that answer was
not reflecting on my own time working as
a waitress and a bartender throughout
undergrad and graduate school to pay for
college I know that restaurants indeed
had food so where was it as I started to
research food waste I was blown away at
the amount of perfectly good food that
we throw away in this country while
millions of people go hungry every year
in the u.s. we waste 72 billion pounds
of good food this is enough food waste
to fill a 90,000 seat football stadium
to the brim at least once a day every
single day let me put it to you another
way we waste approximately one pound of
food per person per day I want you all
to think about that waste for a moment
and now think about all the people that
are going hungry now my eyes were open
and I started to see food waste
everywhere that I went and we&#39;ve all
seen it we&#39;ve been at a restaurant
attending a dinner party or good we all
know a conference at a hotel and we see
all this extra food have you ever
wondered what they were going to do with
there my hypothesis was that it was
ending up in a dumpster so I started to
ask a question everywhere I went what do
you do with your extra food at the end
of the night in restaurant after
restaurant the answer was always the
same we throw it away one night after
leaving a restaurant for dinner I
witnessed a man digging through their
dumpster trying to find a meal can you
imagine being that hungry our food
insecure living on the streets have
become so desperate
then in lieu of seeking out soup
kitchens with limited hours they now
know that they can head to the dumpsters
of our favorite restaurants hunger is a
three-fold problem its social its
economic and its environmental on a
social level we have 42 million people
going hungry including 1 out of every 5
children and this is affecting their
ability to learn in school we have
seniors receiving just 16 dollars a
month in food stamp benefits struggling
to keep food on the table and did you
know that hunger affects crimes -
studies have shown that people turn to
crimes like shoplifting in order to
provide food there for their families on
an economic level we spend two hundred
and eighteen billion dollars a year to
produce transport and dispose of food
that we never eat and it&#39;s a legitimate
environmental issue according to the EPA
food waste has increased 50 percent
since the 1970s now encompassing 27
percent of everything in our landfills
this is this food since it gradually
rots and produces harmful methane gas
leading to global climate change
so we&#39;re wasting all of this food it&#39;s
costing us billions of dollars and it&#39;s
bad on the environment yet people are
still going hungry we literally have two
problems that can solve each other what
if we use all of this good food going to
waste to solve hunger there are tons of
resources out there from our food banks
to our soup kitchens to the ongoing
efforts that we see in the grocery store
yet the fact remains that 72 billion
pounds of food are going to waste in
millions of people are going hungry
how can we tap into this good supply of
food and support these efforts I started
to ask businesses another important
question why don&#39;t you donate your
surplus food and what I found is that
they were afraid they were afraid of
being sued but more so they were unaware
unaware of the federal protection
already offered to them under
Good Samaritan Act passed by President
Bill Clinton in 1996 which offered these
businesses protection for willfully
donating their food and good faith we
have to lose the fear in the hunger
fight because in the u.s. not only is it
legal it&#39;s profitable in an effort to
combat food waste two years ago a new
tax law was introduced it&#39;s called the
path back it allows businesses to
write-off up to thirty percent of their
annual income for their food donations
so what this means now is not only can
these businesses improve our communities
they can improve their bottom line so
now that we&#39;re past the fear of
liability and we know that donating this
food makes good business sense if hunger
isn&#39;t a problem that is caused by
scarcity or the unwillingness of
businesses to donate food why are people
still starving I have come to see now
that hunger is actually a logistics
issue and that in order to solve it we
must first eliminate the access barriers
that are preventing people from getting
food how can we feed people as we have
fed land fields for the past century
that answer is technology with
technology we could do some amazing
things right with our phones from the
palm of our hands we can watch our
favorite TV shows listen to music get a
ride order groceries surely if we can
use technology to meet our future
husband or wife we could use it to fight
hunger we can use it to help get excess
food from businesses to establish
distribution points like food banks
faith-based organizations even directly
to families in need tech innovation in
the food waste space can alleviate
hunger and global warming at the same
time in France in New Zealand wasting
food is illegal businesses are actually
fine for not donating their edible
surplus food to cause organizations and
when they do donate it they&#39;re using
technology to track it I believe so
strongly in this approach that
technology will solve hunger that I&#39;ve
started a company to do just that so
that we could solve the food logistics
problem
a company dedicated to developing the
technology necessary to automate and
manage the surplus food supply chain
process that ensures the delivery of
this food from businesses that have it
to organizations and people that need it
all while allowing businesses to track
and account for their donations so that
people like my friend Savannah and the
millions just like her family always
have access to food by working with
nonprofit organizations we match them
with businesses with surplus food to
donate and we deliver it directly to
them so that they now can distribute it
right in their community it&#39;s that
simple and my favorite part of the
process is that everybody eats if we can
reduce food waste by just 15% we would
save enough food to feed 25 million
people every day three meals a day in a
country as rich as America no one should
go to bed hungry what&#39;s been done has
been proven not to be enough with
technology we could change this we can
help businesses save money by
redirecting their surplus food to
communities in need by eliminating the
transportation barriers and handling the
logistics of getting food from
businesses to people if we can focus on
food waste as the next big revolution
then perhaps we can solve one of our
greatest world issues nationwide tonight
one out of seven people will go to bed
hungry and while many of us will leave
here and go and grab something to eat
the reality is that tomorrow morning 42
million people are going to wake up
hungry and not knowing where their next
meal is coming from including 13 million
children and 7 million seniors this food
that is going to waste is so much more
than just waste it is power it is
changed it is treasure it is the ability
to feed a hungry child which could be
the difference to that child learning in
school in passing that test it&#39;s
allowing our seniors to never have to
make a decision between paying for their
prescriptions and
paying for food it&#39;s seeing a reduction
in crimes commit it to feed one&#39;s family
it&#39;s lifting the financial burden off of
people that are already living on the
marginal poverty line I believe that
this food will give people hope in their
darkest hour because this food is social
change we have the abilities we have the
resources the know-how and the
technology the time to eradicate hunger
is now and I&#39;m inviting you all to join
me in this fight if you are a restaurant
owner
are you working the food service
industry do not be afraid to give and if
you&#39;re a private citizen just like me
don&#39;t be afraid to ask the question the
next time you&#39;re dining out or attending
that hotel conference what do you do
with your extra food at the end of the
night and if you find that they throw it
away or that they are looking for a
solution please connect them to me
together we can solve this problem
because with technology hunger has met
its match
thank you
