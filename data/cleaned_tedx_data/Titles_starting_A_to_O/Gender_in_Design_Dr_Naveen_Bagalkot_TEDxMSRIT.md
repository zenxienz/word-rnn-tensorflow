I&#39;m a researcher and a faculty member at
sixteen stood of our design and
technology in your Lanka and I do lead a
program called as human centered design
for masters which is exploring
interaction design and design of digital
tools and technologies but today I will
be talking about how design limits the
limits of design through the case of you
know self quantification and sexual and
reproductive health because that&#39;s one
of my areas of work so design is
basically a Herbert Simon defined design
as as a tool or an error as a method
that you can use to move from current
state to a preferred State right as a
means to an end and these days Design
Thinking is everywhere you have a
complex problem through design thinking
at it or through some designers at it
it&#39;ll be solved like that so that seems
to be that seems to be the ideal
everywhere that I see and when I say
design I I mean engineering design
technology design creative design all of
it together you know I mixed them all in
one packet but let&#39;s see let&#39;s try to
unpack how design limits so the idea the
central idea that are going to talk
about is it that design creates more
problem that it can solve ever you know
design is considered to be a creative
problem-solving methodology but it
creates more problem in most cases what
are the problems it creates that that
designers never think about is that
design disciplines right it excludes and
it usually in most cases perpetuates
status quo harmful status goes right so
you all have fitbit&#39;s right I don&#39;t use
one but I&#39;m sure many quite a few of you
use Fitbit so know what is a Fitbit
these are these devices that you wear
and it has a pedometer and you can track
how fast or how many calories you&#39;re
burning and stuff like that
this is an advertisement for one one
such devices I can&#39;t read the name I
think it&#39;s my fitness tracker or
something but you wear and then it
measures your calories burnt and and all
that all that healthy it makes you be
fit right it supports you to be fit and
healthy so what&#39;s wrong with this what&#39;s
wrong with this image right do you know
this image this ad was put in London
Metro and it was banned because of the
harmful body images that it portrays for
teenage young girls because they were
forced to have a beach ready body which
means that they have to have tie gaps
and whatnot and whatnot right so isn&#39;t
it the same no don&#39;t just look at the
replacement at what it is telling you
when you&#39;re using that device it&#39;s
telling you and Fitbit I think has a
tagline if I&#39;m not right it says that
this will be the better you be a better
you or something of that or a fitter you
so it&#39;s telling you that there&#39;s only
one body type allowed to live right if
there&#39;s only one kind of fitness there&#39;s
only one kind of you know being a life
and that&#39;s probably right so this is
what design does when design is not
thought through right so design
disciplines design disciplines bodies
and design disciplines lives what are
the limits of such thinking is you have
this this is not a joke
it&#39;s an actual product you can buy it&#39;s
illegal in India because sex toys are
illegal in India but you could if you&#39;re
in the UK you can buy this it&#39;s a
pedometer for your penis right great
right so you know you want to measure
your sexual performance talking about it
wear a pedometer have fun but most
likely it&#39;ll be just you not your
partner
so now I wonder you know I I move about
and we all have seen this and this is an
image taken from Hindu and there&#39;s an
article about this about how in urban
India and rural India that these lot of
these unhealthy practices about sexual
health
swapna dose which is you know night
falls is considered to be a bad thing
for you and then come to me pay me and
I&#39;ll give you some herbs and you can get
rid of it which is a natural phenomena
right so do you see any difference
between this and this no they both
perpetuate harmful myths about sex and
sexual performance and sexual health
right so design again disciplines but
it&#39;s also excludes because this is
obviously design by men for men right
reducing sexual performance to
parameters or thirsts and that&#39;s just
just the main conceptualization of what
sexual pleasure is and only for men
right so this is designed by men for men
now let&#39;s look at what happens when
design men design products for women
it&#39;s going to be a disaster
so again taking so and that to menstrual
and reparatory of health products right
apps for tracking periods and forget
about so the first and this is a great
article in Atlantic about how self
tracking apps exclude them and it should
take a look at this
but it&#39;s amazing so right from the
layers of visual design pink women
listen in something let&#39;s throw in some
flowers you know make it appealing to
them right but but if you dig a big
layer deeper it&#39;s amazing so they are
they are helping women to track these
and sending messages to their husbands
or their partners right why why are they
enabling a female body you know which is
kind of bound and owned by a female
access to him men about it right again
design in this way disciplines gives the
control to more powerful people than the
marginalized and it excludes right
women have been tracking menstrual
cycles over the decades and ages before
apps came right have these designers to
read these studies these practices I
don&#39;t think so so design in that sense
also excludes you know so let&#39;s look at
what would happen if a woman is part of
a team that or leads a team that designs
you know something about reproductive
health product so this is a very
interesting product in the Silicon
Valley called as my dot flow and the
website is track my flow so this is a
product in in the u.s. they use tampons
right
how many men you know what&#39;s a tampon
super do you know why Indian women don&#39;t
wear tampon and prefer the pads
no because virginity a you have to be
virgin because if you insert a time time
moon your hymen will be most likely be
broken right so this is a product in in
the US and it has a smart sensor that
this woman scientists developed
she&#39;s now productizing it which detects
when the tampon is filled up so that you
can change it it sends an alarm to your
smartphone if there&#39;s an app and you can
it gives you details about when to
change it&#39;s like time to change or you
have to change in the next 15 minutes so
women can change the tampons it&#39;s great
also because they have done a lot of
research there talked to women and have
you know kind of worked with them and
produced this because thank one should
not be left for longer inside the vagina
because it creates infection right but
one of the key things they all talk
about in the video especially and when
you look at the research is that one of
the key fears that they&#39;re trying to
address is the fear of the stain sub the
gotcha
menstruation get out bill Cullen eh-eh
and not to be seen there bad right so
despite great care despite human
centered approaches despite working with
women despite led by a woman design also
perpetuates status quo right
they don&#39;t inquire into why is that
stain so bad why is it so stressful for
women it&#39;s not the mistake of women mind
you but it&#39;s a society how many you know
women here have been terrified by the
teasing in schools when your skirt got
red right so this is something that you
know design as a product as a system
never never engages and that is why I
believe that design actually perpetuates
status quo right let&#39;s take a look at
what happens when design is done
differently so I call it as designing
with the stress on ing
which means that design is never
complete you know and it doesn&#39;t matter
who designs who&#39;s the designer it&#39;s
never complete it&#39;s a continuous process
when you look at that let&#39;s see what
happens okay so this is a phenomenal
work by an organization in the airport
called as Jensen sand or talk it was
started by a very good friend who has
now become a very good friend
called as Lakshmi Murthy who is a design
graduate from NID and she has been
working in rural with a poor for 25
years Counting and her main focus has
been to develop tools and training to
empower a descent goals and boys in
rural with a poor around sexual and
reproductive health rights
so those baseless that you see are
basically self quantifying bracelets but
the way that it is made and borne is a
group of adolescent girls are all made
sit around you know and they have these
beads yellow and red beads each one
confesses how many days do they
menstruate and what are the gaps between
those days right so they discuss about
openly about that menstrual cycle and
they pick up the red beads for the
number of days they menstruate and the
yellow beads for the periods in between
and make their own bands and bare it
now the making of the band is just one
more excuse to talk about this openly
and mind you these are the communities
where women are girls are married and
girls and boys are married at the age of
four five eight ten ten marriages
rampant right these are tribal
communities marginalized communities in
the hills of around oh they both
recently they&#39;re also lakshmi has
started making what is called as a gear
baits or pads who care in in in my body
is rising okay so these are cotton patch
because what has happened is that the
sanitary napkins have been invading the
villages and these are very harmful for
many reasons especially in rural parts
because these girls don&#39;t have money to
buy this or they&#39;re very very shy to ask
for money so they buy one pad and they
use it for long which is very harmful
because it has harmful chemicals this is
what I bought when I was there I just
came from with I put by the way two
weeks I&#39;ll tell you what I did there so
this is the newest form of the pad
so this is how you insert and these are
for these are towels for heavy flows
this is the one for regular flows okay
so these are the ones for heavy flows
now guess why this inner lining is white
because as with any excretion of
throttle-body you need to be aware of
what color is it you need to see it so
that you know if it is an infection or
not when my daughter who is now three
years old was you know about you know
just born
there&#39;s a beautiful database beautiful
if you think it&#39;s beautiful where people
have contributed their children&#39;s
diapers with poop inside that is color
coded which tells you if this is a color
of the poop then it means that your baby
has this like diarrhea cold fever or
healthy it&#39;s all based on color of poop
similarly the color of menstrual
discharge has to be seen so it has to be
white right now
Lakshmi and Gail foundation have had
multiple pushback from corporates who
buy these for their CSR to make this
color dark and she says no way you don&#39;t
buy it from me but I&#39;m not making this
dark in any way because it&#39;s not just
about make you know kind of packing and
observing but it&#39;s also about you have
to wash these and dry it in the Sun so
when you do that it becomes an object
that is out there
visible challenging the status quo about
not talking about menstruation in all
our homes not just in the villages
villages they talk more openly urban
homes we don&#39;t talk about it so this is
this has evolved over 25 years of work
with organizations and people right this
is not common like that so this is what
I call as designing now let&#39;s I&#39;ll just
show you a couple of examples of what we
did every year I take my students there
for two weeks the project course is
called as future of interaction design
and I do believe that the feature of
design has to be in such spaces
rather than in you know creating
conceptual products that nobody would
ever use right so this time I took a
group of 15 students and we worked with
rural adolescent you know coming from
the villages of around with a pool for
five days and five nights and one of the
things that we did is we stitch these
patch by hand
you know both boys and girls but there&#39;s
an image where I have mostly boys but
one girl that&#39;s my daughter so I took
her to I usually do and we stitched
these bats right
so all these three boys are married and
they&#39;re 16 years old 17 years old and
one is 19 years old they are married
they were engaged when they were two of
four years old and they got married now
about a couple of years back and they
had to fail because they they married so
they had to drop a year they had to fail
so education you know and and career it
doesn&#39;t matter so much as getting
married early now they were here sitting
with my students sitting and whatever
the discussions that happened
what is menstruation why it has to be
white who will you give this for so all
the boys who says their question was I
also got one nice just one I got it to
my wife the question was who will you
give this wives girlfriend sisters and
how will you talk about this so the
activity of making a menstrual pad
reusable
through that we could break down
barriers and talk about menstruation you
could talk about ecology we could talk
about difference between cotton pads and
the cotton linings and sanitary napkins
which are plastic we could all do this
by making a pad which is what
essentially is design so design is all
about making so if you can look at
design as a method that can bring in
people and have a conversation rather
then it is it gets more interesting
let&#39;s watch the video person and I&#39;ll
say what happened terrible the to a
Gami bulu son suna some nodoz who i
arizona you to be la Sapna heya cabron
he hit Katina Hakim Koba tiny Orca hey
cow bolta to a cameo you phone the
ku-ku-ku-ku rui Seca
Cuchillo Akira camomile ah Loretta Leto
Berta Baja Nakata Chadi tequila vodka
hey so this entire zone those those are
my student students so we along with the
students wrote this sound together then
the punchline was mine by the way where
I&#39;m a huge fan of 90s music so one of
the key things in villages and in urban
is something called as nightfall
and Swapna - it&#39;s called us of mothers
witches it&#39;s not a Doge it&#39;s not a
mistake so we were also the what we&#39;re
exploring is how do we go back to our
communities and make these you know
something that can use something that
can be so we can talk to them you know
so this is something that Emmer&#39;s but it
has to work in a larger ecosystem of the
organizations and we are working on how
to take this forward but when things
come together when people different kind
of people come together and you are
facilitating it in the right way you
know something emerges so back to my
premise this is what design thinking is
as a means to an end but I would rather
say that designing is more more fruitful
more important for the kind of complex
problems that we are encountering it&#39;s a
process that never ends and it&#39;s
something that you have to constantly
explore collaboratively you can&#39;t say
that I&#39;ll design something and everybody
will use you have to go back to the
community work to the community like
Lakshmi date for 25 years and Delap
something over time so my argument for
designing is that it has to be located
as in with the community and
collaborative and it has to undersell
it has to include and it has to
challenge status quo right so we you
know a couple of years back I came
across this article I think it was in
Wired magazine that somebody is arguing
that variables need to get under the
skin right now my kind of leaving
message is if you don&#39;t consider design
as designing then you will be stuck with
this thank you
[Applause]
