my name is Tala Rossi I am an
iranian-american swimwear designer if I
really think about it
my designing destiny began with Barbies
when I was a little girl I became
fascinated with threads fabrics colors
shapes but most of all were the
beautiful models and clothes in my
mother&#39;s illegal fashion magazines after
the 1979 revolution in Iran many
restrictions were imposed on women and
by law they had to cover themselves my
mother owned the stunning long black
mink coat that she always kept in the
storage room she chose not to wear it
just because she didn&#39;t want to draw too
much attention in public so I thought
why couldn&#39;t Barbie win at eight years
old I cut about eight inches off the
bottom of this cone to make my blonde
Malibu Barbie that came with a pink
ruffled - ensued a fur coat I didn&#39;t
know what the value of fur was at this
point in my life I guess you could say I
had good taste as you may imagine my
mother did not find his creation as
fascinating as I did I was punished by
my parents simply because what I had
done was wrong I think my parents wanted
to discipline me not to become reckless
what I took from their punishment was of
course I shouldn&#39;t be cutting my
mother&#39;s expensive clothing I should
look for these material elsewhere
perhaps somewhere my parents wouldn&#39;t
find out
so a few months later I cut a piece from
my father&#39;s leather chair to make this
to make the same Barbie a leather skirt
I had seen a striking leather skirt in
one of those magazines and I wanted one
to my defense the cut was fairly small
and from the sight bottom of the chair
so I didn&#39;t think anyone was going to
find out unfortunately they did and this
time around my punishment more intense
and I think my parents thought that I
was pretty much insane dreaming up and
making this fur coat and the leather
skirt truly sparked my desire to create
I didn&#39;t know what a fashion designer
was at this young age and growing up in
Iran after the Revolution I didn&#39;t get
to watch fashion shows and TV mainstream
designer boutiques didn&#39;t exist back
then woman in the streets were always
covered schools only prepare you for
traditional careers and of course
culturally my parents wanted me to
become a doctor lawyer perhaps a rocket
scientist fashion was never really an
option for me and when you&#39;re born and
raised in a place where being different
independence and individuality earned
really options your dreams may become
limited I started experimenting with
fashion even more as I got older being
creative and freedom hungry in Iran as a
teenager was a recipe for disaster I was
constantly clashing with the values of
others for most of my childhood and
teenage years it felt like the majority
of the things that I wore was offensive
to someone well there was my school
officials extended family friends or the
government and eventually me wanted to
showcase my personality and sense of
style
through what I wore and seek for more
freedom got me in trouble with the
government I was put in jail and
brutally punished for attending a co-ed
party dancing to Western music wearing
indecent clothing
but ultimately for seeking freedom but
you see bad things don&#39;t happen to you
so that you can give up with a broken
soul they happen so that you can learn
and rebuilt yourself with even more
strength to find purpose to become the
person you were intended to be when I
moved to the US I quickly realized that
freedom was not about the amount of
clothing I put on or take off it was
about having the choice to do so I now
could become whoever I wanted to be and
I kind of could start making money from
doing what I actually loved navigating
these two dramatically different worlds
from growing up in Iran under many
restrictions to moving to the land of
the free where dreams come true gave me
the desire to create more opportunities
for myself I quickly learned that I
needed to take my options seriously
because I had seen a place where people
didn&#39;t have options I couldn&#39;t take my
freedom for granted because some people
could only hope for it I quickly
realized that my dreams were not only
valid but important because some people
don&#39;t get to dream the way that we do
and I realized that the only difference
between me and those people was that I
held the US passport and was now given
opportunities that most people would
fight for but I also realized that when
I got to the dream country my dreams
weren&#39;t handed to me on a silver platter
I had to create them and work really
really hard to achieve them I now knew
what it was that I wanted to do fashion
and I had found this purpose to fuel
that dream I wanted to build a clothing
label that celebrated the beauty of
woman an empowered woman all around the
world to follow their dreams without the
fear of punishment or judgment doesn&#39;t
that sound amazing it did to me I just
didn&#39;t know how I was going to do that
the unknown is intimidating and it is
human nature to focus on the possibility
of failure it&#39;s a fact of life the many
of the risks
we take don&#39;t pay off the way we want
them to but if you&#39;re open to the
unexpected life will always shed light
on an area of an opportunity you will
have to then define that opportunity and
realize why it&#39;s there to serve you and
once you identify this open door you
will have to plan a course of action
towards that light to manifest the
destiny that you crave so I didn&#39;t waste
any time I got to work quickly
I took chances over chances I started a
t-shirt line when I was 21 years old
which completely failed due to my lack
of knowledge in the fashion industry
I was scared sad depressed devastated
embarrassed but what I didn&#39;t realize at
the time was that this wasn&#39;t a failure
I got to learn some of the most
important aspects of the industry that I
was trying to break into just by doing
so just by experiencing manufacturing
production distribution pattern making
no failures forever there is always more
and more chances plus who sets up the
bar for failure anyways after this I
decided that I was going to open a
boutique I had this gut feeling that
this was a genius idea and then it was
going to get me so much closer to my
dream my father once told me if partners
were good God would have won
[Laughter]
[Applause]
yeah he said this to me
after a really bad business partnership
and of course at the time it didn&#39;t
really mean anything to me I just found
it funny it wasn&#39;t funny anymore when I
found myself in a wrong business
partnership and my store opened right in
the middle of 2008 when the economy
crashed
I felt again and this time around much
bigger and much harder but when I went
back to an ordinary job I really got the
meaning of what it is it is better to be
at the bottom of the staircase you want
to climb than to be on the top of the
one that you don&#39;t want to be at my
swimwear line it&#39;s my third company and
it&#39;s my third attempt in making my dream
a reality
and a very messy attempt when you try to
achieve anything in this life it can
also create a mess the best thing to do
is to clean up that mess once you start
picking up the shattered pieces you will
discover all the magical reasons that
got you turn I have failed many many
times from businesses relationships
promises the list of failures is long
perhaps is long enough that I was able
to write a book about all my failures
imagine that you have to cross a body of
water and in front of you are stepping
stones some of these stones are close
together which makes it effortless you
jump to the next step you keep jumping
and moving forward and then you look
down and the next stepping stone is
further away and there is no going back
so your options are to stand still
paralyzed with fear or to challenge your
capabilities and remember the fear only
has power over you when you doubt
yourself growing up in Iran I never
thought I would become a swimwear
designer but I did I never thought that
one day I would be featured in the same
pages of those illegal fashion magazines
I used to dream about so much but I did
I never thought that one day I would
write and publish a book in English when
I spoke no English until I moved to
u.s. but I did we aren&#39;t own anything in
this life we are born and the rest is up
to us so if you want something bad
enough you have to go and get it because
some people aren&#39;t lucky enough to feel
that kind of fire thank you
[Applause]
