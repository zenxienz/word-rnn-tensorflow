have you ever had a dream sort of like a
premonition at the age of 15 I
experienced one of the worst dreams ever
in this dream many people including my
family and friends were sick and dying
and no one knew why this was happening
this dream stayed with me for over
thirty four years and it wasn&#39;t until I
experienced some devastating moments in
my life when I realized the dream was
real after graduating from high school I
decided to aim high by joining the
United States Air Force I enjoyed being
in the military and the opportunities
that it provided one of the main
requirements for me was to stay
physically fit and being the tomboy that
I am that was never a problem many years
after leaving the military I found
myself on a battlefield totally
unrelated to the Air Force and like
others I too had fallen victim to
obesity prior to gaining weight I was
very comfortable in my size 10 weighing
160 pounds over the course of time I
painfully witnessed my weight and size
increase from a 10 to a 12 of 14 a 16
and 18 no longer weighing in at a
hundred and sixty pounds but now 236
pounds and if that wasn&#39;t bad enough I
struggled I struggled with high blood
pressure high cholesterol I was
pre-diabetic the dream of people being
sick and dying slowly began to emerge
into my reality but I wasn&#39;t going out
without a fight instead of going to the
gym two and three days
a week I continuously increased my gym
visit to a point in which I was going
four to five days a week twice a day I
would go in the morning before work and
in the evening after work food for me
was of no concern because I was a
healthy eater I prepare most of all of
my meals I very seldom ate out at
restaurants to give you an example
dinner for me would be corn bread red
beans and rice fried chicken slice of
pie with ice cream and then I will wash
all that down with my homemade sweet
teeth despite my efforts I could not get
the weight off and keep it off so I
secretly join multiple weight-loss
centers and I use many products still I
couldn&#39;t get the weight off and keep it
off so I decided to do something totally
out of the norm and during the Lent I
decided to give up meat and animal
by-products eggs milk and cheese for 40
days only after the 40 days oh I had
lost 33 pounds I was feeling so good and
to celebrate to celebrate I treated
myself to one of those meals that I was
accustomed to and as soon as I took a
bite of fish oh my stomach began to hurt
and I felt dizzy not understanding what
that was about I decided to try it again
and as soon as I took a bite of that
meat I immediately became sick to my
stomach and dizzy I mentioned this to my
brother and I told him what I was going
through and what I was dealing with and
it was my brother&#39;s who said hmm seem
like your body has given up that meat
that doesn&#39;t want it anymore and you&#39;re
becoming one of those vegan people
feeling good about the weight loss but
totally confused about what I was doing
this led me to do my own research and
what I found out is that food could be a
weapon for my body or a weapon against
my body so me a vegan you mean to tell
me that for the rest of my life I will
have to eat some fruits vegetables
grains nuts and legumes really who does
that
I know I did it for 40 days only only
but you know what I felt good the weight
was coming off and staying off and my
health began to improve
so I decided maybe I should check out
those vegan people and find out exactly
what are they eating who are they and
where are they getting that protein so I
decided to sign up for this vegan
cooking class and while I let this class
the host comes out and she says today
I&#39;m going to show you all how to prepare
cornbread greens macaroni and cheese
wait did she say macaroni and cheese I
already know how to make macaroni and
cheese and there is nothing vegan about
macaroni and cheese so I raised my hand
excuse me yes did you say that we were
going to make macaroni and cheese she
said yes I said oh wait wait excuse me
is this a vegan cooking class she said
yes
I put my hand down and i sat there and I
was amazed at what I was learning and
finding out after that cooking class I
realized that I was going to be still
able to eat some of the foods that I
loved I learned a whole new way on how
to prepare kale and other delicious
recipes
the standard American diet is the
traditional diet of a majority of
Americans which is high in meat dairy
fats and sugar this diet is known to
cause high blood pressure high
cholesterol and even diabetes for the
african-american community the standard
American diet is contributing to many
preventable diet-related illnesses which
is plaguing our community at an alarming
rate the vegan diet on the other hand
consists solely of plant-based foods it
is totally devoid of animals and animal
by-products this diet is also known to
lower blood pressure cholesterol no form
of diabetes ladies and gentlemen I
confess I am a vegan and it&#39;s been over
five years since I made the lifestyle
change
I no longer struggle with high blood
pressure high cholesterol I am NOT
pre-diabetic excessive weight and
illnesses a cripple in our society
the gym was never a problem the problem
was in the foods that I was eating that
was causing my health issues the dream
that I had when I was only 15 years old
is in fact today&#39;s reality many people
are sick and dying and through my work
and passion for healthy eating and
exercise I I answered that call and I
became a certified health coach it is my
goal to encourage inspire motivate
others to lead the charge
and healthy eating and exercise I will
always allow food to be my medicine and
never ever again my poison and you can
too thank you
