I&#39;d like everyone to take a minute and
think about their day if you&#39;re anything
like me you wake up in the morning take
a shower get dressed eat breakfast drive
to work work eat lunch work some more
drive home eat dinner and go to sleep
what if you got into a car accident and
your car was totaled you&#39;d Oberer right
you&#39;d use lifts you use a bus I&#39;d still
make it into work no problem okay so all
the money that you&#39;re now using on uber
causes you not to be able to pay for
your water bill you can&#39;t take a shower
so are you gonna be the stinky guy who
shows up at lyft to go to work oh oh one
more thing you don&#39;t have clean clothes
now you&#39;re gonna be the stinky guy who&#39;s
in dirty clothes who shows up on uber
you don&#39;t have money you don&#39;t have food
anymore could you even go to work
I want to talk to you about the
invisible population you&#39;ve seen them
they are visible believe it or not
you&#39;ve seen them in the park
you&#39;ve seen them downtown you&#39;ve seen
them on the off ramps to the freeway and
now you all know exactly who I&#39;m talking
about it&#39;s the homeless but this is why
they&#39;re invisible take a second and
think about the last person that you saw
that was homeless do you remember what
they look like
what color was her hair now what you
remember unfortunately is that they were
gross but their clothing was dirty that
they were doing weird things that were
they were huddled up in a group in a
park you didn&#39;t remember that they were
a person they became invisible to you
well I want to introduce you to
Charlotte when you watch this video
you&#39;re gonna say this that she&#39;s an
actor she&#39;s not an actor in order for
Charlotte to allow me to film her to
show you all Charlotte used the last
bottle of water that she had to wash her
face she had to get the cleanest dirty
shirt that she had and oh by the way
since she washed her face she couldn&#39;t
wash her hair so she had to find a hat
then she had to ask her friend she could
borrow a necklace so that she&#39;d be
pretty for the video this is Charlotte
it&#39;s just hard to get out once you hear
I&#39;m having running water all the things
I used to take forgot it you know I had
it nice in Orange County I had a job for
20 years I had a brain aneurysm I didn&#39;t
have that planned you know the results
can trickle down I got addicted to pain
pills after that for a while so I have
my addiction battles too but there&#39;s you
know it&#39;s just hard to find food it&#39;s
hard to get a job without an address
without a shower to be clean to have
clean clothes you know have a mailing
address it&#39;s just what do you put in an
application I just wanted out of here
the pilot stuff I get out of a dumpster
yeah I think a job I don&#39;t know if
everybody out there wants to work I know
me personally I prefer to work it self
worth that you get you know cause your
self-esteem gets real low out here you
feel like you&#39;re nothing nobody you
don&#39;t matter
you know people walk around you like
you&#39;re good day just on the sidewalk and
pull their kids away we&#39;re not some
people we&#39;re not good people out here
but there&#39;s a lot of people who are good
people I think I&#39;m one of em you know my
heart&#39;s in the right place that was
Charlotte she had a brain aneurysm
and now she&#39;s homeless there&#39;s three
types of homelessness transitional
believe it or not it&#39;s you and me some
kind of medical catastrophe happens to
us all the sudden we can&#39;t pay our bills
something happens to our car now we have
to start using money in other ways it
could be any one of us
episodic these are individuals that go
in and out of homelessness more often
than not they have behavioral health
issues that need to be taken care of
which causes that eventually these
individuals become chronically homeless
these are the individuals that really
need programs that need help the problem
is growing significantly I&#39;m going to
put a number up on the screen and it&#39;s
kind of devastating
really it&#39;s the increase of our homeless
population within this city in one year
but there&#39;s government programs right
there&#39;s cities that are taking care of
this our city is taking care of this
right what can you do because obviously
cities states the nation they&#39;re doing
what they can but they&#39;re not taking
care of it what&#39;s the answer what&#39;s the
solution community-based problem-solving
in times of crisis human beings come
together look at Harvey look at 911 you
had people from different states and
Harvey coming in and helping out because
mankind was in trouble
guess what mankind is in trouble a
friend of mine came and visited me and
he was from a foreign country and he saw
this individual who was homeless and it
blew my mind to think about this because
he gunned the invisible population you
know we don&#39;t see him and he said how in
America can you have someone that&#39;s
living on the streets I I couldn&#39;t
understand it I said what do you mean
just look in LA rows and sections of
people that are homeless community-based
problem solving communities coming
together to solve the issue you have
organizations within each of your
communities that do specialize in
homelessness they do outreach they
provide food sometimes they provide
shelter the problem is is that they&#39;re
taking on the problem as a whole and
they&#39;re solving the problem okay they&#39;re
not doing a great job they&#39;re doing what
they can community based problem solving
is the community coming together it&#39;s
the church that decides to provide
transportation to a group of people that
need transportation to job interviews
the need transportation to their
doctor&#39;s appointments
it&#39;s a synagogue that decides that
they&#39;re gonna every Thursday give some
clean clothing to somebody so that they
can go to that job interview so that
they don&#39;t have to sit in filth it&#39;s the
individual who remembers in December how
cold it gets even in the desert man my
hands are cold I bet you his hands are
cold he doesn&#39;t even have a house to go
to what am I gonna do I&#39;m gonna get them
gloves that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do to help
and that&#39;s all you need to do
organization people coming together and
solving the problem that&#39;s all it is
coming together but what&#39;s being done or
rather what&#39;s going on right now I&#39;m
gonna leave you with a story that I want
to give you about
we&#39;ll call him Jay I do outreach
sometimes with the local police
department Jay is 19 years old I found
him in a ditch he was sleeping he wasn&#39;t
dead or you know horrible but he&#39;s in a
ditch he was kicked out of his house he
was addicted to methamphetamines I was
able with PD to call an individual
that&#39;s in this city who runs a
rehabilitation program the next day Jay
was off the streets and he was in the
rehabilitation program five months later
today he hasn&#39;t touched any drugs he&#39;s
no longer homeless he lives up north and
he works on a farm that was me and one
other person that did that you can do it
too
we can solve this crisis we can solve
this problem we just have to come
together
