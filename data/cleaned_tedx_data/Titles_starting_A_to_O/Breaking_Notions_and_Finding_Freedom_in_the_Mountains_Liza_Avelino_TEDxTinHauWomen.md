this is difficult
I&#39;d rather be doing ironing I&#39;m a
mountain climber and a domestic worker
I&#39;m not a speaker when I climb on things
I have a support team well not really
it&#39;s my feet that walk standing here
today
he said afraid mounting for me to climb
and I asked you to join me and support
me let me now take you to my recent
mountain to Kilimanjaro the highest
mountain in Africa climbin djaro is five
thousand eight hundred and ninety five
metres above sea level the put in
perspective is like glamping ICC the
tallest building in Hong Kong twelve
times
plus another three hundred meters will
one encounter numerous steps while
climbing ICC in Kilimanjaro the terrain
is vastly different as well as difficult
it was day seven or summit day here I
come at four thousand six hundred and
forty four metres we got up at midnight
for a summit bit
despite being geared up I could still
feel the cold my toes and I feel
numbness on my fingertips my breathing
became heavy and every step it was
pitch-black and nothing to see aside
from the contour of the giant mountain
towering above us and I look up the
trail of headlamps zigzagging on the
slope of the mountain blending in with
the stars in the sky at each step
I could hear my crunching through rocks
and scream the tick-tock sound of my
trekking pole hitting the ground
I had the recollection of how many hours
had
passed and when we reached a milestone
and sort I thought we were almost there
only to see the headlamps from other
climbers who were ahead of me my heart
sank
I feel the wave of nausea and my legs
were getting very tired my guide told me
don&#39;t look up don&#39;t look back focus on
your foot step one foot after the other
to think of a happy place beer made me
smile in my time of struggles the only
person I could talk to and make me happy
is myself myself talk veered me from the
discomfort of what I am going through at
that moment telling myself this is what
I want no matter how difficult I won&#39;t
give up because I can feel the summit
it&#39;s almost there then I heard someone
said stella point it&#39;s the crater rim it
means six hours of uphill struggle has
come to an end
one hour to go towards the summit the
last few meters took me 45 minutes but
it seems like eternity my legs buckled
and I felt like falling backwards in my
head I wanted to run the final stretch
yet my legs were walking in slow motion
drawing the last ounce of strength I had
and told my legs to keep going then I
saw the signpost touch it to make sure
I&#39;m not hallucinating and yes it was
real wood
finally I made it to the summit of
Kilimanjaro I reached my goal I saw
shamelessly and hug my guide tears
welling in my eyes from both happiness
and extortion for a few minutes I forgot
what I had been true
I had the savor my moment of elation a
realization of a long dream
standing at the summit of Kilimanjaro
made me reflect for a moment looking
back made me realize how far I have come
from my roots in the Philippines I was
born in Davao City in the southern
Philippines my family was very poor my
working as day laborers my parents
constant battle was the focus on how we
survive its day we don&#39;t have money to
buy clothes there were days I went to
sleep hungry we don&#39;t have a permanent
home as my parents move us around from
one town to another to find work but
environment was the same poverty
followed us like a shadow wherever we
went even sending with the school was
impossible I was forced to drop out of
school at the age of 13 I was
heartbroken for I had big dreams I
wanted to travel and see the world
someday and in my young mind education
was a tool to achieve those dreams I
feel hopeless disappointed and full of
self-pity the only thing that comforted
me was that tiny old globe I pick up one
day strewn over the side of a garbage
bin it became my prized position
I would spend my time looking and
turning it round and round
to see all the countries and continents
of the world my favourite continent was
Africa
I found that place exotic a dark and
mysterious I told myself I will go there
someday then the reality hit me and I
thought that dream away at the back of
my heart as a means to ease the family&#39;s
burden
I was married off and became a mother of
twin boys at the age of 21 I felt
helpless
to my situation and part of me became
resigned to the role of being married to
an irresponsible man I had to find ways
to work as a laundry woman to support my
family&#39;s daily needs the side of my
hands getting rashes and infected from
the detergents harsh chemicals made me
cringe and pain and gust disgust for
everything that I am going through
disgust for a woman&#39;s role in a
patriarchal society my childhood is
repeating in my children it felt like
I&#39;m stuck in a quicksand being pulled
slowly to death by powerful forces of
hopelessness one day a friend told me
there&#39;s a job offered the word in Hong
Kong as a domestic helper I didn&#39;t
hesitate a moment except it I was
desperate to get away to escape the only
hard thing to do was the thought of
leaving my children but I knew leaving
them meant I could provide a better
future for all of us
I arrived in Hong Kong in November 1996
while I found my feet in this very new
world my life at home was falling apart
and I eventually separated from my
husband I made everyone and happy with
my decision and I must admit this part
of my life felt like a failure but I
never let life&#39;s experiences failure and
disappointment kill my spirit instead I
used them to fuel my desire in giving
myself permission to live life on my own
terms the way I want being a domestic
worker in Hong Kong I get a day off a
week and I used to spend the day sitting
and hanging out with my friends at the
square or along two walkways in central
I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed
when passers-by stared and sometimes
people to follow the photos of us I felt
degraded so I told myself to go and find
something else worthwhile to do my
belief and the strong desire believe
life on my own terms became the
motivation to change my routine so on
one Sunday in the summer of 2006 I went
to the library to read books while
browsing the shelves I stumbled into a
book about great hikes in Hong Kong my
next day off I set out to follow one of
the hikes the warm night room gap the
trail leads up to a hill overlooking the
city and from that vantage point I pose
for a moment to enjoy the spectacular
view Hong Kong is so beautiful when
viewed from above
and aside from the scenery I also love
the mountain breeze and how it hurts my
cheeks I found it peaceful and relaxing
to stand on top of a mountain I was in
my element that day the mountain clamber
in me was born from then on hiking
became my favorite hobby I hiked alone
for few months and to limit the Hongkong
trampers an informal group who explore
the countryside on weekends people were
friendly and I feel comfortable so I
joined the hikes every Sunday after
three months the elders suggested I
become a hike leader I felt happy and
honored to be given a chance to lead I
got promoted
those Sunday said I led hikes became my
special place I felt empowered one day
as a hike leader my sense of empowerment
was challenged a Western woman was very
surprised to know that the hide leader
is a Filipino domestic worker she said a
domestic worker can lead hikes how
feeling a bit insulted I look her in the
eyes and told her that it was my day off
and I can do what I want and yes
I too can lead hikes despite feeling
insulted I put on a brave face and
stayed where I should be at the front
everyone followed me and we&#39;ve managed
to finish a great hike successful hike
I&#39;m at the end she said thank you for
leading a hike and she bought me beer
I have this belief that no one should
let their situation or their job define
them
no one should let others define their
value I don&#39;t and I want nor should any
of you sitting here today and watching
today through hiking and mountain
climbing I discovered that I am making a
small steps in taking over the driver&#39;s
seat of my life by supporting my
decision to change course and not
letting life&#39;s challenges hold me back I
have been able to reshape my life the
way I want it to be I also inspire other
fellow domestic workers to hike
volunteer in community events and join a
monthly clean up trail campaigns and
participate in dragon boat racing seeing
my own transformation and fall before my
eyes has given me an undeniable
satisfaction and a great sense of
freedom and to see that my action have a
positive impact on others to follow the
same has added even more meaning to my
life journey when I chose to start
hiking in 2006 it was my first step to
see the world on my terms now that I am
in my 40s I have reached my dream of
going to Africa I also achieved things
and never imagined my past ten years
have transformed my life because I
choose to do something differently than
what I was thought possible for someone
like me
by the time I have 15 could I go back to
school and help others reach their
dreams why not now that I am fully aware
that I can leave my life on my own terms
not letting or defined by my job my
gender nationality role as a woman in
the society my wins or challenges or
others opinions my dreams dance with me
I am eternally stoked to continue
building and crossing more bridges and
continue to discover who I am every day
of my life I choose to live fully not
just survive today I am inviting each
one of you to do something meaningful
give yourself permission to live on your
own terms if you dare to do this
what would you want to achieve we all
have our own mountains to climb in this
lifetime
I am climbing mine will you climb yours
I will leave it to you to make that call
but if you do take up my invitation I
promise you you too will find freedom as
I did on your own mountain on top of
your Mount Kilimanjaro thank you
you
