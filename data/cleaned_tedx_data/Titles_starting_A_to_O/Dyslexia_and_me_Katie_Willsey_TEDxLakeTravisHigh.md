dyslexia this Lex II the I s l IX I a
now for those of you who don&#39;t know that
is not how you sound out the word
dyslexia and that is definitely not how
you spell it out it&#39;s actually Chubby&#39;s
sounded out like this which I believe
goes this leg II uh and it&#39;s felt dys le
x IA now when a dyslexic doesn&#39;t know
how to spell a word they are told that
you go and ask someone how do i spell
this word most of the time the response
is you should know this by now or just
go sound it out yourself now as you can
see that did not work at all and the
reason for that is that when the
dyslexic is learning their phonics
they&#39;re not taught the correct way the
way that this LexA is taught in school
is for the normal brain but the dyslexic
brain is not normal there all right so
it&#39;s so when the dyslexic goes out and
tries to do this it doesn&#39;t work and
there are some ways to try to fix this
which are in classes I&#39;ve taken two
classes myself one in eighth grade and
one a ninth grade the when I went into
eighth grade I had a lot of trouble
reading I could barely read an
elementary school level book at fifth
grade in 30 minutes I look at a page it
takes me about 30 minutes to read this
page and I still wouldn&#39;t understand
anything that was on it and when I got
out of this class in eighth grade
I was starting to be able to read middle
school level books which was a big
improvement for me
and then jump ahead to when I got out of
the class in tenth grade I was able to
read a high school level book it page
and I was able to read a high school
level page in a book in five minutes
which that is a big jump from being able
to read a fifth grade level book in 30
now this is what a dyslexic sometimes
sees when reading luckily this is not
what I see I see something more along
the lines of this as you can see the
word the words ha I&#39;m pointing outward
the word letters from one word will get
switched from the word it should be and
glued on to the end of another what I
also see is the spaces between like on a
page of a book I will follow the lines
down the page and not really focus on
what the book is but I&#39;ll just follow
like patterns and on the page of the
book and yeah gosh now the reason for
this might be because of the font that
it is reading and the font the reason
for this might be because of the font it
might be because a dyslexic brain just
messed up it&#39;s just part of being
dyslexic and I had a problem not that
long ago probably about a month ago when
I was standing in lunch in the lunch
line trying to get food and I was
walking along and this and then I see a
sign try our humans one dollar this I&#39;ve
stared at it why is this school selling
humans and why for one dollar
that seems underpriced so I continued
staring at the sign and then I realized
that the sign did not say try are humans
and in fact said try our hummus
very different things
two very different things yeah so some
of the thoughts that could help a
dyslexic include Ariel
cambree font and 20th century century
goth and I&#39;m sorry for all you font
fanatics out there but Comic Sans isn&#39;t
one of them sorry about that
and this guy&#39;s by the name of Christian
Bohr is dyslexic and so what he did he
decided that since he is having such a
hard time reading and reading forms and
filling him out that he was going to put
his graphic design skills to the test
and create dyslexia font this is what it
looks like I remember seeing the spot
and thinking wow this is so much easier
to read and the reason for that is the
the font adds on parts of the letter
that normally isn&#39;t there in a normal
font like with the L in a normal l and
the normal font it would look more like
an uppercase I so he adds on this little
part right here so you can tell it&#39;s an
L which is helpful with my last name
we&#39;ll see two L&#39;s but sometimes I&#39;d look
at it and see three that&#39;s helped with
that also with the V and the W sometimes
the dyslexic brain can just cut off part
of it and see the V see the W as of E or
the V a so W works either way
but with this font it clears up a lot of
things because of what the guy did he
cut he cut off corners on Sun and made
some of the bases thicker and made parts
of it thinner and this made it a lot
easier to read and the thing is some
people don&#39;t have access to the teachers
that can teach him how to teach them how
the phonics works or show them these
those fonts and a lot of those people
end up in prison because they don&#39;t know
their basic phonics and facts which
means a lot of people that you don&#39;t
learn what they&#39;re supposed to end up in
prison over 53% of inmates and this one
prison and ended up having dyslexia and
they didn&#39;t know their basic phonics
so a lot of those people be ended up in
prison because they ended they believed
that they could not an out to anything
because no one could teach them how to
learn they thought I can&#39;t amount to
anything but this is not true in fact
the dyslexic brain has abilities that
your normal that the normal brain does
not there&#39;s a wider peripheral view
meaning they can see farther on both
sides which I can do pretty cool there&#39;s
also some dyslexic can see 3d models
inside the head and turn an inside out
and backwards and they can also
recognize patterns a lot quicker than
others and be able to recognize the air
and patterns this means that the
dyslexic can&#39;t succeed but they have to
succeed in other ways so just because
you&#39;re dyslexic don&#39;t think that you
can&#39;t amount to anything don&#39;t think
that you can&#39;t succeed to anything
because you can succeed you&#39;re just
gonna have to find other ways to succeed
thank you
