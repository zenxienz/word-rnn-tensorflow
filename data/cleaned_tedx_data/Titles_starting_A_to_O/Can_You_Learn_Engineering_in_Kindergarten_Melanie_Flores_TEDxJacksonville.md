I&#39;m here to challenge you to think about
how we educate our children could they
learn engineering in kindergarten little
kids they can say and do things that
make you cringe I still remember the
time I dropped my son off at preschool
and as I was driving away I overheard
him ask a teacher why your teeth are so
yellow
they have no filter but that&#39;s also why
nothing stops them from believing
anything is possible and because of that
they are capable of far more than we
realize
and the time for them to start growing
and identifying as problem solvers is
today because they&#39;re gonna be looking
out for all of us tomorrow so you see
this shoe it was engineered by a five
year old girl I&#39;m about to take you on a
journey into the mind of a child
engineer I&#39;m the tour guide and it&#39;s a
job I never dreamed of but three moments
in my life brought me here to you today
the first moment was in my freshman year
at MIT my friend Scott was sitting in

the hallway outside my room at 3:00 a.m.
and he was working feverishly on
something he&#39;d made himself he was
taking MIT famous design and
manufacturing class where every student
gets a standard parts kit it&#39;s a box
with wires and motors and other hardware
and they have to make a robot to compete
in a contest now normally you can hear
Scott&#39;s laugh a mile away but that night
he was silent and he had this hunger in
his eyes that I will never forget the
second moment was when I was an engineer
in North Carolina I was tapped to join
the team in charge of starting up an
optical fiber factory from
scratch and it was grueling we ran into
challenge after challenge but one night
we hit the start button and finally saw
our first real sellable product come out
the other end and that felt like winning
the gold that&#39;s when I finally tasted
what Scott was after in that hallway the
experience of creating something from
nothing and seeing it work and the third
moment it was when I became a mom now if
there&#39;s one thing that makes you feel
like you&#39;re a newbie you don&#39;t know what
you&#39;re doing it&#39;s Parenthood but there
is something I did learn about myself
early on and it stemmed from all those
times I feel my kids tug on my shirt and
I&#39;d hear their voices say look mommy
look what I did that&#39;s when I discovered
something that no matter how fulfilling
it is to say I did it like when we
started up the plant from me it is a
million times sweeter to hear those
words from a child so when it was time
to go back to work
I didn&#39;t return to engineering I chose
education because I wanted children to
experience that I didn&#39;t moment for
themselves I made my way to Kingsley
Montessori School in Boston where my
peers and I created a child-friendly
version of that MIT class Scott took
every kindergartner got a standard parts
kit but instead of wires and motors they
got stuff from the junk drawer bubble
wrap duct tape cardboard and instead of
robots they made shoes now why shoes
first of all you can&#39;t make a working
robot out of duct tape and bubble wrap
not yet anyway second everyone
understands and uses
but we needed a map to guide their
thinking and that&#39;s where the Boston
Museum of Sciences engineering his
elementary diagram comes in this is a
blueprint it boils the engineering
design process down into five steps ask
imagine plan create and improve so this
map was our guide my peers and I
challenged every kindergartner to design
a functional shoe document their work
and deliver a formal presentation now
element even we thought you meant might
be a region but you know what with kids
it&#39;s all in the way you say it so this
is how we framed it guess what you&#39;re
gonna be an engineer for three weeks
and you&#39;re gonna make a real shoe all by
yourself and we&#39;re gonna take lots of
pictures and you&#39;re gonna get the
pictures and make a very special book
about how you made your shoe then we&#39;re
gonna take the pages and show them on a
big screen you&#39;ll be like the movie we
can watch with your parents and all your
friends see doesn&#39;t sound like work that
sounds like the chance to be a star so
that&#39;s how our workshop was born my
colleagues and I have said alright let&#39;s
do this and we all held hands and jumped
and this is what happened so ladies and
gentlemen the tour is now beginning
prepare to enter the mind of a child
engineer so first we talked in general
about what engineers do we find and
solve problems we help people by making
useful things like cars inhalers diapers
and afterwards one of the girl wrote
this in her journal Engineers solve many
problems by first figuring out what the
problem is then trying to solve it
how many adult struggle with figuring
out what the problem is
how many times do we solve the wrong
problem then we talked about what makes
a good shoe and the children came up
with two measurable design criteria the
shoe has to stay on your foot one when
you walk from one point to the other and
two when you jump ten times then we
passed out the standard parts kits
that&#39;s when the wheels started turning
like this boy he kept running back and
forth between the sink and his parts
pile and I finally said him what are you
doing and he said I&#39;m testing to see if
it&#39;s waterproof because he wanted to
make a waterproof shoe and then once all
the kids were done imagining the shoes
they were chomping at the bit to get
started but we said no cutting or gluing
without a plan so they all sat down and
they sketched the pictures that were
inside their heads and those plans look
like this
detailed and then once I signed off on
their plans then they could get to work
now making shoes is fun but that&#39;s not
where the real meat is engineers find
and solve problems now if you&#39;re a
teacher you know there&#39;s that one kid in
your class who thinks it&#39;s a race and
when that little boy or girl would run
up to me and say I&#39;m done my work on the
first try I&#39;d call them on it
I&#39;d say we&#39;re not done
you haven&#39;t engineered anything go put
that shoe back on your foot and listen
to what it&#39;s telling you because it
needs to be better tomorrow than it is
today
otherwise your story might be boring
ooh that&#39;s when their stories came to
life we said write down all your ideas
write down what worked so this boy wrote
down how he added felt because his shoe
was sticking to his foot and another one
added what he called a toe covered
because his toes kept sticking out and
then we said write down what was hard
that&#39;s the best part that&#39;s what makes
your story juicy so this girl discovered
her shoe is uncomfortable so she added
padding and another girl started over
because she realized she spent all day
making it beautiful but it didn&#39;t even
fit then they all practice their
presentations when their books and shoes
were done and then when the big day came
the kids were all giddy with excitement
these two showed up wearing Blazers
children were fighting to go first and
then every single child got up by
themselves and shared their work with
confidence pride
and joy and after their presentations
they each walked around the room slowly
with their prototypes letting everyone
get a close look it was like they were
showing off a baby
and those close-ups revealed just how
brilliant every shoe was but the
greatest accomplishment for these
children is none of those things it&#39;s
that they learned something about
themselves they discovered these four
words I can do it and their sense of
triumph shines through in countless
journal entries that my colleagues and I
stumbled on after the children handed
their journals in like this one I like
to make my shoes because I think it&#39;s
fun and I like to do it because it is
hard
I love making my shoe and I chased a
dream both of those entries is a child
saying look what I did our children are
our future someday they&#39;re gonna tackle
much bigger challenges then making a
shoe that stays on your foot so we need
to be giving them real opportunities now
to let them grow and identify as problem
solvers and to seek better ways of doing
things so join the conversation in your
community support programs that develop
these skills you can&#39;t find them start
them because every single child is on a
journey and every day is a fresh start a
chance to try bold ideas and to test
them even if it&#39;s
messy and to embrace struggle as the
best part of the adventure thank you
[Applause]
