you
you
hello and I&#39;m here to talk about
deception in advertising deception is is
when one person tries to trick another
person or in our case when analyzers try
to trick you into buying things there
are loads of deception and advertising
for example have you ever seen those
commercials with perfect food well it&#39;s
actually inedible things that look great
on TV did you know that those
commercials that delicious-looking roast
chicken actually just raw chicken stuff
to a newspaper and potato mash then they
spray-paint the golden brown look onto
it and put it on camera
look looks great on TV but not that
edible though mind-blowing isn&#39;t it
people in these kind of industries also
use promotions from those new movies and
films such as the second a new stores or
My Little Pony movies come out they put
it on chips bags and suit can drew names
like should I brunch or unicorn sparkle
chips I tell you this also do things
like buy this today for a chance to win
an awesome fries and put these extremely
cheap toys in cereal boxes to deceive
parents into thinking so when one pants
are deceived to thinking that not only
they get food for the child but also a
toy to play with
fast fast food places do similar things
though unlike the cereal boxes the toys
they put with their meals are completely
unrelated such fast food please PLEASE
Pokemon toys with their meals why do
they do that doesn&#39;t mean Pokemon made
it was made from Pokemon meat please
explain it to me and France replaces
also continuously repeat ads over and
over and over now time to talk now
that&#39;s over it&#39;s time to talk about
deception and toy advertising have
you ever seen those commercial would
have really catchy theme tune and kids
having so much fun that sends children
running to the palace screamin can I
have it please please pretty please well
that happens in commercials only and
rarely ever happens in real life
advertisers tend to animate the toys and
edit the video to make it look as cool
and attracting as possible talking about
that I also got achieved when I was
smaller I was watching TV when I saw
this really cool commercial
so naturally I rushed my parents to the
toy shop and bought it when I came home
to play with it I didn&#39;t do it did
nothing the commercial told me and work
really easily I was extremely
disappointed and upset and some toys
things like the hottest trends today
were rigidly made a long time ago such
as Pokemon colleges trading cards like
every other cause made advertisers also
tend to shape toys around popular things
like the new stores moving called the
Jedi blaster pilots rifle retract the
fence - right now in our conclusion I
say that we should always do our
research or read the small thing before
buying something because if you don&#39;t
you&#39;ll probably be deceived out of your
money thank you for listening
you
