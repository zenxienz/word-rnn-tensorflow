we had a really good rehearsal yesterday
everybody seemed to know what they were
doing
I had practiced and practiced and I got
up here and I mumbled two or three lines
of what I had prepared and then I went
blank so after thinking about it for a
minute I had this brainstorm
I&#39;ll just improvise and I got about five
sentences into that so I says well the
poor third choice is to read what I put
together
so here it is hi I&#39;d like to talk to you
today about gratitude my first 25 years
I thought anger and depression was as
natural as being cold or hungry my
strategy for avoiding anger was don&#39;t
drive during rush hour avoid my
mother-in-law and drink a lot of beer
around my 25th birthday I had the good
fortune to read Marcus Aurelius as
meditations
nothing happened well a lot of things
happen but it was very subtle
Marcus thought me that I might be able
to learn how to get stuck in traffic
without beating on a steering wheel and
making a lot of unpleasant noises living
mindfully is not a decision it&#39;s a
practice over the last 50 years I&#39;ve
developed some very supportive habits
just about every day I study meditate
read and act exercise also healthy food
and interesting activities or help but
far and away the most powerful tool I
found was gratitude we react to our
perception of things nothing is all dead
sort through whatever&#39;s going on and
find something to be grateful for my
grandfather had never had a tractor he
hauled milk into the creamery and
scanned Eva&#39;s with a horse and buggy a
horse and wagon and he didn&#39;t even have
lights till after 1939 when I was born
the world has changed more in my
lifetime than it did since the dawn of
Agriculture ten thousand years ago
we now live better than the kings in
royalties in all of history but still
over three billion people live in this
world on less than two dollars and fifty
cents a day
here we are indoor plumbing electricity
radios televisions computerized
telephones in every Park almost every
pocket in the last hundred years the
life expectancy in the America has gone
up by fifty percent that&#39;s for both men
and women by any by almost any measure
we have more to be grateful for than any
other generation in history it&#39;s been
the work of a lifetime training myself
to remember that the instant my thought
goes to poor me or why now or any other
disharmonious thought I try to remember
to look for a positive aspect of
whatever&#39;s going on turn on to it to
turn on to some kind of grata or turn on
to some kind of a gratitude grant thanks
for my wife my kids my dog your cat
extra money etc it&#39;s really helpful to
make this shift as quickly as possible
creating gratitude is a skill like any
skill practice brings improvement
another way to look at difficulties and
inconvenience is opportunity now I can
practice my gratitude skills right here
in this incident in this instant rough
seas make strong sailors I can practice
the piano whenever I have a keyboard but
the only time I can practice creating
gratitude under stress is when
everything is wrong nothing ain&#39;t right
it&#39;s a dynamic asset like running a
six-minute mile if you don&#39;t use it
pretty soon you&#39;re gonna lose it that&#39;s
why it&#39;s important to be involved with
others doing things that are sometimes
very unpleasant the key ingredient is
remembering this impatience or annoyance
is a signal another opportunity to
practice gratitude mild impatience can
be transformed into a
reflection on the brevity of life and
what a foolish waste of time it is to be
tense create the habit of recognizing
disturbance as opportunity not a
difficulty to get away from but a chance
to grow and get resilient start a
gratitude journal talk about it with
your friends and family put up be
grateful signs around your home and at
work and your workplace in addition to
gratitude I also try to reflect on how
it would how would have acted 40 years
ago last week I was almost late for a
meeting and I couldn&#39;t find my cell
phone I left out loud when I thought
about what a freak show that would have
been young Dean kicking chairs and
muttering about all his miseries which
was a typical way I handled unpleasant
situations was very unpleasant now I
find it amusing to reflect now I find it
amusing to reflect on Mahatma Gandhi
said your beliefs become your thoughts
your thoughts become your words your
words become your actions your actions
become your habits your habits become
your values and your values become your
destiny we can materially change our
biology our biology with our thoughts
it&#39;s easy to see that when you&#39;re
startled by a lion but when we create an
experience of impatience or annoyance we
set off the same alarm bell but not
quite as loud this low level stress
takes its toll on our health and our
happiness every single perception has an
Associated biological impact scared out
of my wits that gave me goosebumps the
hair on my neck bristle anger fear and
impatience wear us down and use up our
lifeforce joy happiness and delight
build us up and create energy
I would guess I would guess that
everyone in this room has been stressed
or impatient in the last week or two
that&#39;s a small thing right just being
just part of being human well it&#39;s a
very common thing but I&#39;m not so sure
it&#39;s small we are an accumulation of
thousands of small
decisions and reactions the key
ingredient is remembering this
impatience or annoyance as a signal one
more opportunity to practice gratitude
and preparing for this book I watched
some videos on mind over matter
Amy Cuddy&#39;s TED talk fake it till you
become it has a very powerful message
fake it until you become it practicing
may seem difficult at first but keep at
it eventually it will become easy being
grateful will become a way of life for
years Tony Robbins has been running
seminars that include walking barefoot
from 15 feet of red red-hot coals at one
seminar he psyched up a really skeptical
Oprah Winfrey and he was oh oh oh brah
Oh brah and she was looking like a
scared like a deer in the headlights and
then she started Oprah and then she
walked 15 feet through glowing coals I
mean he could see her feet stepping on
these rocks think about the implications
of that thousands of people have created
a mine state so powerful they can walk
barefoot through glowing embers without
getting burned and I get this really big
I get this really big attitude when I
come into the kitchen and the cat
sitting on the cutting board chewing
away at the chicken I&#39;m preparing for
dinner
it was my carelessness not - it was my
carelessness that allowed this situation
what should I do blame myself blame the
cat or give him a piece of chicken and
laugh about my latest but not less
stupidity in 2001
professor Irving curse hadn&#39;t had to
invoke the Freedom of Information Act to
get the Food and Drug Administration to
release the results of a group of drug
trials the data showed that in more than
half of the critical trials of the six
leading antidepressant drugs
did not outperform the placebos what an
incredible demonstration the power of
our thoughts to alter our biology we can
create or eliminate disease with our
minds many times I have read if you
really want to learn something teach it
over the last few months as I thought
about today&#39;s presentation I became a
lot more aware of how often I allowed
low level impatience and displeasure a
voice in my head said if you want to
teach about gratitude if you want to
preach about gratitude you better really
practice it and I have and I&#39;ve seen a
difference Napoleon Hill said every
adversity has within it the seeds of an
equal or greater advantage I&#39;d like to
encourage you to seek out the good in
every situation you find yourself and
practice being grateful it can really
enhance your life thank you so that was
the thing that took me two months and
change and change and we changed it over
change and everything else when I left
here after this rehearsal I can&#39;t even
call it that on the way home I was this
resolution gonna make up these cue cards
like bill had he did such a great job
all I have to do I had these cards and
it&#39;ll really go great and I wouldn&#39;t
have to think and I did that and I
worked on that and by about if there
were beard going to bed he got up early
and I was taking a shower
I just realized that&#39;s not gonna happen
wherever that blank was it&#39;s still there
so I figured well I got a couple hours
to kill alright something else
this is using gratitude skillfully this
is in some kind of starry-eyed panacea
that says everything is wonderful the
world&#39;s a messy place full of some full
of surprises but we can learn how to
skillfully navigate this unpredictable
river of time if we we find ourselves in
it doesn&#39;t take knowledge fitness or
wealth just be grateful
that&#39;s a really big just sort through
whatever&#39;s going on and find something
to be grateful for if you can&#39;t find
something else would be grateful for so
much of the unpleasantness we experience
is has its roots in attention take a
deep breath put this occurrence in a
realistic perspective it&#39;s not easy but
it&#39;s simple come into the present come
into the present moment and be grateful
most days over the past 50 years I have
read the few a few passages from markers
Marcus Aurelius meditations so I&#39;ve been
thinking about this for a long time we
have this five-month old cat that moved
in with us in June so about 6 o&#39;clock
this morning I&#39;m writing and he&#39;s laying
on my lap purring the room is warm the
coffee&#39;s hot
God&#39;s in his heaven all as well then he
rolls over and bites me I grit my teeth
grab his cute little head fully
intending to snap his neck and flip him
across the room and then I remember I
love him and he&#39;s only being playful
this whole little drama took place in a
microsecond it was way less than half a
second
gratitude is a skill a skillful a
skilful maneuver this is the opportunity
and the challenge of using gratitude as
a skillfully as a skillful Manute to
maneuver our way through this adventure
of life here we are now something will
happen next take the time and put any
effort to become resilient use gratitude
to skillfully manage the next thing life
is good
make the most of it thank you
[Applause]

here with Sarah Sarah Albert and soils
