I am a teacher and I&#39;m a practical girl
it is Who I am and it is what I do I
have taught in many countries around the
world and I have had many students the
youngest being about 18 months and the
oldest about 87 so I think that just
tells you there is always a time to be
learning in our lives I have also taught
a number of subjects though they have
been a common thread that has run
through them all and that is the thread
of fitness so I have taught voice which
needs a fit larynx in order to function
I&#39;ve taught languages which needs a very
agile tongue in order to function I have
taught physical fitness which requires
the entire body to be in shape but it&#39;s
the last subject that I came across that
I would like to talk to you about today
and that is the subject of money Fitness
it came to me as a complete surprise
totally unexpected I never thought I
would find myself in the space in my
life let me take you back World Cup
football a very exciting time lots of
money being spent in the country many
different people from from different
places using their currencies lots of
abundance and excitement happening
around World Cup football and I was part
of this I was working full time I also
had a little entrepreneurial project
going on on the side and at one of the
stadiums in South Africa and I was
working really really hard work work
work
in fact so hard that the ticket I bought
to watch Brazil playing North Korea
I couldn&#39;t even attend the match I just
had too much work but like all good
things there is some reward at the end
of it and I was rewarded with a lovely
fat bonus wonderful and I did what I
always do
when I got extra cash I quit my job and
put all the cash in my pocket and went
overseas now I wasn&#39;t in my country of
choice one hour when I had the whole lot
stolen from me gone boom in a flash gone
and I found myself with no job and with
no cash yes a little bit of a desperate
situation it still took me a little bit
of time to realize that actually having
all that money stolen was just a symptom
of a problem I had been having for quite
a long time in my life in my
relationship with money
and that is that I had no idea how to
keep it and how to build it
and I found myself like this perhaps you
have also found yourself in a desperate
state financially before and this is
when I started my business money fit and
when this little piggy named pound by
the way and I came to work together and
he became my mascot so I was in a
desperate State I was one of those
people that towards the end of the month
because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would be able
to pay my bills on time I did fun things
at the beginning of the month because
that&#39;s when I had money I even
embarrassingly was involved in an
investment which I thought was really
cool but it took me five years to
realize I was losing money every month
in that investment so I really needed to
wake up and I needed to get some new
thoughts I needed to get some new ideas
I really needed to retrain my cardiac
money muscles you know the ones that
work automatically without you thinking
the ones that were saying to me someday
a man will look after you don&#39;t worry
the ones that were saying to me you&#39;re
not very good at numbers so don&#39;t
confuse yourself with money the ones
that were saying to me but it&#39;s a man&#39;s
job to earn not yours
I had to retrain all that I was thinking
about myself and about money because I
had no future and I had no security so I
took out a faithful lovely bright red
lipstick and I started to write new
affirmations on my shower walls now I
shower every day so I got to see those
every day and I read them out loud every
day every day every day and the more I
exercise the more often I showered the
more often I read them it&#39;s a discipline
to do that now I know the word
discipline has kind of bad connotations
and we think of school and strict and
army and stress but let go of those
thoughts for a moment discipline just
comes from the Latin word disciplina
which means teach and I have to teach
myself now the cardiac muscles are not
enough I also have to train my core and
this is where the hard work really
happened training your core your core is
what keeps you upright your core is what
secures you not a partner okay
it&#39;s your core muscles that secure you
and my core was like jelly wobbling all
over the place no stability
no security maybe I could have retired
when I was a hundred my dreams they had
so many zeros on them I couldn&#39;t even
count there was no future in store with
me so I started to work and I started to
work with small change literally do you
believe that coins and silver can change
your future they can they did mine in my
first month I started to gather all my
all the coins like a honeybee I didn&#39;t
let anything get past me and I gathered
them all up and by the end of the month
I had a hundred and eighty Rand and
fifty cents which is about thirteen US
dollars doesn&#39;t seem like much but it
was enough it was enough for me to take
that money and go and buy a fraction of
a share on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange not even a full share just a
fraction and it was fun it was sheer
shopping hello I could make that a habit
that was fun and so I thought well let
me carry on doing this and at the sin of
my second month I had a hundred ninety
Rand about $13.50 and I went and bought
some more shares and as I did this my
eyes opened to the economy my eyes
opened to the South Africa around me I
started noticing companies I started
looking around and going I own a share
in that company even if it&#39;s only one
how empowering it was for me at the end
of my third month I had two hundred and
twenty year and about fifteen US dollars
eighty now you can imagine with all that
positive emotion going around with me it
wasn&#39;t difficult to move to the next
step and not only gather my coins would
start allocating a percentage of my
income towards buying shares this is
where it got super empowering because I
felt I was part of South Africa I was
part of the economy I was a spoke in a
wheel that was moving that was
progressing now the first time I
received my first financial documents in
the post I didn&#39;t go and collect them
for rather a long time because I thought
it was a speeding ticket so I didn&#39;t go
and collect and then when I eventually
did go and collect I was so excited to
have this booklet of financial documents
from my first share that I owned not
only was
paying tax now but I was actually
providing away for South Africa to move
as an economy and I was really excited
about that
so I took my 10% started making it 12%
currently I do fifteen percent of my
income into shares in South Africa and
now actually also around the world
because those things are available to us
so those old ideas I had about my mass
brain not working we&#39;re completely wrong
percentages are very cool when you&#39;re
looking at your future and I started to
get comfortable with those numbers I get
started to get comfortable playing
around and seeing what I could
potentially potentially do in the future
so before I knew it you might surprise I
was really part of something and I
realized they are not enough of us part
of that and my mission has only just
begun
because I&#39;m not happy just being fit
myself what fun is that I want everyone
to be fit I want to get every South
African on board spreaded across our
continent and across the globe because
there&#39;s absolutely no reason why each
and every one of us cannot be money fit
it&#39;s an action it&#39;s not a knowledge and
I invite you I implore you to let go of
any reasons or excuses you might have
and join me and join piggy pound on our
journey as it carries on and be one with
us in control empowered and confident
with your money thank you thank you
