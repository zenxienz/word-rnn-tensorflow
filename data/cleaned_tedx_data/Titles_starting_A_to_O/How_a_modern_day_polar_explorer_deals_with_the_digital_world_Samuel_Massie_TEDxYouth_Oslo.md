hello&#39;s people my name is Samuel Massey
I bet all of you guys in here own a
smartphone and I also bet that
smartphone is with you here today and
it&#39;s not in your backpack is either in
your pocket or it&#39;s in your hand
and in average all of you guys in here
spends more than four hours everyday all
of you guys and the rest of the Western
world&#39;s for hours every day on your
smartphones that&#39;s more than what you
spend with your friends or even your
family&#39;s the closest thing you have and
for me that raises the question when is
it that you are using the digital world
and when is it that you are misusing it
when was the last time for example you
guys thought that you would just leave
yourself on home for whole day turned
off and when I look back at my life I
would say that I was definitely misusing
it in a very high degree but when I was
17 years old I decided to turn off my
cell phone for one whole year because
when I looked back at my life when I was
young or when I was younger
I&#39;m now a grown man in the beginning of
my twenties but when I was when I was
sixteen years old I remember I was
living in a start-over everywhere
everybody owned a smartphone and a
computer and iPad and I remember I was
home studying and suddenly my phone
would go Bing and I read it and it&#39;s him
it&#39;s a message from Kristin wondering if
I want to join her for cinema tonight
and I write her back and I go back to my
studies and suddenly it&#39;s a new Bing
it&#39;s the notification Liverpool&#39;s
winning 2-1 against Manchester and I go
back again to my studies and it&#39;s a new
Bing it&#39;s a new Bing it&#39;s a new Bing and
the bottom line is that I love all of
these things but for every single Bing
it takes me out of my concentration out
of here in this very moment into
everywhere else and what&#39;s so dangerous
about it is that it creates a habit for
all of us it creates a habit of
not being able to concentrate on
anything for more than just a moment
always having this easy escape route
into this screen of the digital world
and for me I started leaning on it like
a like a crutch and that every single
moment where I just give didn&#39;t get
instantly stimuli store every moment
where we&#39;re just a little bit
uncomfortable I would dive into that
screen or at every moment where I just
met tying a bit of challenge I would
stop giving up and when you start giving
up but every single challenge in life
it&#39;s not going to take a long time
before your self-confidence just gets
blown away and for me with the lack of
focus I my my grades in school went
straight to hell and the doctors started
I ignore diagnosing me with
concentration all disorder dyslexia and
several other diagnoses and at home
instead of confronting these feelings I
would just paralyzing them trying to
dive into the screen of digital doping
but when I turned 17 I made a decision I
made a decision to set sail to the
world&#39;s most roughest and remote
continent in a whole world Antarctica to
spend one whole year without any
reception in solitude of the digital
world and I started sailing and for the
first two weeks I just panicked totally
panicked I remember you know it was a
digital detox and I was full of
abstinence it&#39;s just like running around
on the boat with my phone nope I try to
get any reception and when you&#39;re out in
the middle of fucking Antalya it&#39;s quite
limit of how much reception you&#39;re gonna
find and but it wasn&#39;t the lack of
reception which was the worst part it
was it was it was what it led to it
this was the worst sound I knew and that
was the sound of complete silence
it was the worst sound on you every day
the sound just got more and more intense
and the more quiet and was outside of me
the more of this storm was just brewing
inside of me and at some point I just
crack and I start crying and it&#39;s like
and all of these suppressed feelings
that I&#39;m feeling just hits me in the
face with a hammer and as a reflex I&#39;m
reaching for my phone without any
reception just clutching it hard to my
chest and for all of you guys who have
broken out of bad habits before you you
know it&#39;s a tough change and and there
in the silence you know it&#39;s just snot
and tears everywhere but it&#39;s nowhere to
hide I have to be there all along with
myself and I cry and I cry and when my
crying&#39;s done I I just feel this this
this this this calmness coming over me
it&#39;s this calmness of having able to
broken down these walls of uneasiness
try disconnecting with the world and
actually connecting with what really
matters which is myself and after that I
stuff after that moment I started
enjoying the silence I started enjoying
the sailing and and you know we&#39;re
sailing 3,000 kilometers away from near
civilization
we&#39;re in this where nature is wildest
and when you&#39;re all the way out there I
see it&#39;s this feeling of being
sufficient that hits you because you
know when you set sail from your last
port of call you know that when that
storm hits you you have to be sufficient
you have to be good enough because when
you&#39;re in the middle of that storm and
it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s you you cannot call call
somebody for help you cannot Google
you should do you have to stand there
and stand through it because that 35
meter high fucking wave it&#39;s a very
physical thing come straight against you
compared to all of that internet
bullshit was rounding us with and and
you have to be this efficient you have
to be good enough you have to take that
responsibility and that responsibility
is something I wish I would have taken a
lot earlier in my life and after that
storm and everything quiets down it&#39;s
this sort of boredom which hits me
because I remember at home I was bored
a lot but that every time I was bored I
would try to paralyze it dive into I
would binge watch sitcoms I would just
try to paralyze it with Facebook feed or
newsfeed and doing anything to not be
left alone without boredom but here you
know just just imagine and I&#39;m out
sailing and everybody is downstairs
sleeping it&#39;s in the middle of the night
and I know that I&#39;m gonna stand there
sailing that boat doing nothing else for
the next six hours before anybody comes
up and keeps me company and the only
thing that keeps me company is the sound
of the waves hitting the bow and stars
in the sky and for the old me that would
be an unbearable boredom but for the new
me now that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the ultimate
boredom it&#39;s it&#39;s in that boredom I
managed to just just relax my shoulders
and just disconnecting from the world
and focusing on on this very moment
focusing on myself and it&#39;s in that
moment I managed to reflect where I&#39;ve
been in life where I am and even where I
want to be it and it&#39;s in that very
moment I I managed to disconnect from
that autopilot which every one of us
have since Island set a course for the
future consciously and it wasn&#39;t that
ultimate boredom that I set set myself
the most hairiest goal a guy who&#39;s been
fully diagnosed with everything could
have had I set myself the goal that when
I get home to the digital world I&#39;m
going to write a book I&#39;m gonna write
the whole book and most of you guys are
probably wondering how can a guy who
flunk or everything of school and
couldn&#39;t concentrate for more than 20
seconds for just a year ago managed to
write a whole book and but you know what
I did I I found a solution I went home
and I took my phone and I found this
strange button on the side of it and
which is a button I used very often
today and I press it and turn it off and
I turn it off for six months and I
started writing and I wrote and I wrote
and I would write for days and night
without any stopping and I wrote 387
pages and I became an author I became a
best-selling author and I wrote that
book to prove for myself that if I want
to I am able to say that change is
possible because to first fix your
problems you have to understand them and
when you are logged on in your mind
every every day for several years it&#39;s
like a computer you know you have to
restart it you have to just turn it off
sometimes and I&#39;m not telling you guys
to to turn off your cell phones for six
months like I did but why don&#39;t try a
week why not try one day because it&#39;s
only up to you how you want this digital
world to affect your life thank you very
much
