so you will probably know that viruses
can make us sick but you might not know
that viruses also contribute to about 10
percent of all cancers so epsilon by
virus EBV that I work on infects the
majority of the world but most people
haven&#39;t heard of it so EBV is a
fascinating virus I obviously think so
but how does it contribute to cancer
well first of all I think we should
think a bit more about what cancer is so
cancer happens when cells in your body
become faulty and then those cells can
stop your body from functioning properly
at all so we&#39;re all made up of cells
every single part of you is made up of
cells we start life as a single cell and
by the time you&#39;re here now as an adult
you&#39;re made up of about 30 trillion off
of them so the average cell is about 25
micrometers across so if you put 30
trillion end-to-end they&#39;d wrap around
the world 19 times so why do we need
this vast number of cells and that is
basically to be everything that it is to
be human and to be able to do all the
things that we can do so you need
stretchy skin cells to cover your body
you need smooth blood cells it can flow
through your veins easily or long
spindly nerve cells and it can carry
feeling around your body and the reason
that we can become so incredibly complex
with all these cells is because of DNA
I&#39;ve completely forgotten my slides
there&#39;s some cells and here&#39;s some DNA
okay um so what is DNA and it&#39;s like an
instruction manual
it&#39;s an enormous set of codes that
describe all of the things that make up
your cells all those molecular machines
and how they work
and they also tell yourselves when those
cells should die and when they should
multiply so every single minute hundreds
of millions of your cells are dying and
hundreds of millions of new ones replace
them and that&#39;s just normal that&#39;s just
how your body functions but sometimes
this process can go wrong and the cells
can grow out of control so a cancer cell
is basically one that is become rogue
it&#39;s starting to grow out of control and
it&#39;s stopped listening to the signals
that would normally tell it to die so
this can happen because the DNA gets
damaged or the molecular machines that
the DNA encodes become damaged this can
happen for a variety of reasons like you
know we know about cigarette smoke and
UV light can damage DNA some problems
can be inherited in DNA or salts can
happen by accident but also viruses can
have a part to play
so EBV isn&#39;t like say a flu virus that
you pick up you feel a bit grotty for a
few days and then you can fight it off
it stays with us for life and this is
because of a property called latency
this means that the virus is essentially
silent in your cells so that it doesn&#39;t
really make you sick and your immune
system therefore doesn&#39;t try and fight
it off and usually this is fine because
the the virus is usually harmless and
but it&#39;s part of this process that can
contribute to cancer but this property
of latency has also meant that the the
road to working out what EBV is doing
has been fraught with difficulty so this
is Denis Burkitt who in the 1950s was
working as a surgeon in Uganda and he
made a startling observation so he
noticed that he and his colleagues were
treating a really large number of
children who had very fast-growing and
very rapidly fatal tumors in their faces
in their abdomens and he thought this
was so bizarre this common tumor that he
resolved to figuring out as much they
could about it and how the cancer that&#39;s
now called Burkitt lymphoma
much to his dismay and might be treated
so it was in 1961 when Berkut was in the
UK on leave giving a lecture and that
lecture happened to be attended by this
man uncie Epstein so Epstein at the time
was working on a virus that could cause
tumors in chickens so it&#39;s important
that you know that but then nobody
believed that viruses could cause cancer
in humans and actually virology was even
more of a niche market than it is today
so even Epstein himself remembers that
his discipline was considered deeply
unfashionable and even a bit eccentric
but when he heard Berkut he was sure
that a virus must be the cause of
Burkitt&#39;s lymphoma so he convinced
Berkut to send some samples over to the
UK for examination and so then over the
next three years Epstein and his then
PhD student Yvonne Barr tried everything
they could to examine the tumor samples
that were coming over but every
experiment they tried failed and because
biology was so poorly thought of this
was even at the the point that it was
threatening the futures of their careers
but then an unusual sample arrived this
sample had been on such a turbulent
flight that some of the tumor cells had
shaken free from the sample and so
instead of throwing away these cells von
Barr tried to grow them and she was
successful for the first time in history
to grow these lymphoma cells and then
that meant that Epstein could use a
powerful electron microscope to look
inside the cells and there he saw the
unmistakable image of a virus however
convincing the skeptics that this was a
newly identified virus and that this
virus could cause cancer would take
absolutely decades of work and
researchers all around the world so here
I feel that I need to tell you that
Birmingham has played a really
significant part in that we&#39;ve been
studying EBV in Birmingham for over 34
years
and we found out a lot in that time most
I&#39;m not most importantly but out of my
interest is that EBV can affect whether
cells die so it means that we know that
via the EBV infected cells can survive
better than ones without the virus so
cell death because it&#39;s such an
important process is a really carefully
regulated process and it happens in a
number of stages so in my research I was
interested to know how could I be v in
in Burkitt lymphoma effect this and what
we found is like I said EBV is latent in
Burkitt lymphoma cells and so that means
that only a really small number of what
turned out to be quite unusual virus
genes are active on their own these
virus genes didn&#39;t seem to do very much
but actually when you put them together
we found that they can synergize or
cooperate and through this cooperation
they can actually affect the function of
some of the most important cell survival
signals that control cell death so what
I&#39;ve done is just a really tiny part of
a much much bigger picture but in
Birmingham we are now comparing the
changes that we found in the molecular
machinery in EBV positive cancers
compared to non EBV associated cancers
and normal tissue and we&#39;re trying to
find ways to target the virus
specifically to enable us to make really
specific therapies that won&#39;t give side
effects to patients and we&#39;re doing this
in collaboration with all of our
colleagues around the world and together
we hope that we will be able to cure
some of the 200,000 BBV cancers that are
diagnosed every year so that&#39;s that but
I just want to spend the last minute
just talking to you a little bit about
kind of how science works so I became
fascinated by biology when I realized
that they have sort of a bit like
windows into what it is to be human okay
so
viruses have evolved with us for
millennia and that means that they&#39;ve
learned to navigate all of the things
that ourselves can do and actually when
we find out how that&#39;s happening more
often than not it&#39;s in such an unlikely
or surprising way and that means that
some of the pioneers of biology have
been the people with the most tenacity
that will take risks and stick to an
idea but also those people with the
biggest imagination and this fascination
really made me change the course of my
life so I thought if I have R ended up
up here it might be doing something like
this but instead of going to drama
school which is what I&#39;d lined up I
decided to come to Birmingham and be a
biochemist and and what I really want to
get across to you is that I thought back
then that I was going to lose all my
creativity but what I found is that
research and science is actually the
most creative things that we can do so
you can see this in the work of Berkut
who was so convinced he had to help his
patients and carried out his first
research project on a budget of 25
pounds or Epstein and Barr who suffered
disbelief and failure actually had to
create completely new ways of working in
order to introduce us to this cancer
virus but even with today&#39;s technology
is incredibly difficult to study all the
decades of EBV researchers in Birmingham
who have absolutely changed what we know
about viral adji and about cancer and so
finally I want to make a bit of a plea
that science at its best with all the
courage all the hard work and
determination and imagination is only
ever a reflection of the scientists that
are doing it because we&#39;re trying to
figure out what it is we don&#39;t know that
we don&#39;t know so what I&#39;d like to see is
more people who know that science is
truly a creative and imaginative
endeavor and see creative people come
together with scientists because I think
if you&#39;ve got all of the different
viewpoints of all of the different
people then together I hope there are
very few questions that would be unable
to
