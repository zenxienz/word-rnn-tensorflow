everyone so sometime last year I was
applying for the student award one
section of the application form was
titled community service so I wrote
about my work in helping to organize
this you summit that gathers young
people passionate about the environment
and empowers them to take on
environmental projects in their local
community three days later after I
handed in this application form I got a
call from the organization that
coordinates the award the lady on the
line told me that her organization was
looking for real community service
experiences I was confused wasn&#39;t that
what I wrote on my application form so I
asked for a clarification and she told
me we are looking for real instances of
helping people things like tutoring
children building houses or visiting
elderly homes have you done any of these
things I realized after this phone call
that some people believe charity work
means visiting a remote orphanage
halfway across the world and handing out
brand-new stationery in fact that was
what a few of my friends tried to do so
a few weeks back a few months back
actually some of my friends signed up
for the service trip to Nepal to work in
a local school when they came back I
asked him how they went and they told me
the most constructive thing they did in
Nepal was actually shopping in their
words it was stimulating the Nepalese
economy apparently their 7-days service
trip was actually a six-day scenic tour
across Nepal accompanied by half a day
of actually visiting a school so for the
first six days of their trip they dined
on buffalo meat and splurge on expensive
coffee on the last day of the trip when
they actually went to visit a local
school they discovered that the school
they were sent to was actually
frequently visited by volunteers and as
a result the chill
at school we&#39;re doing quite well and
they didn&#39;t need any help
not all trips end up like this and
sometimes volunteers think they can
actually bring on a positive change a
group of boarding school girls went to
Tanzania to help build a library now
they did their best at putting bricks
and cement together and two weeks later
voila the children had a new library
sounds great right well that&#39;s only part
of the story you see every night after
these girls went to bed
the local men would sneak out and they
would demolish whatever structure the
girls had built during the day because
it was about to collapse they would
rebuild it and in the morning the girls
would get up and believe what was in
front of them was actually their work so
what did these people contribute during
this two weeks not much they effectively
failed a single task they were there
they were there to do some times
volunteering doesn&#39;t just feel to bring
much good it actually brings more harm
than good
overwhelming international volunteering
has spurred whole new industries in
certain countries in Cambodia the number
of volunteering are the number of
orphanages increased by 75% over a
five-year period these orphanages are
there to cater for the number of
tourists who are just so
enthusiastically trying to vine a ball
to find an orphanage to village to visit
and the problem is there actually aren&#39;t
that many orphans in Cambodia to fodeez
orphanages so what the operators of
these orphanages do is that they go
visit parents and lure them to send
their own children into an orphanage by
promising that they will be better
educated better house better fed a study
by Columbia University showed that three
out of four children in Cambodian
orphanages actually have one or more
living parrot and if you think about it
the operators of these orphanages have
no incentive to treat these kids well
they are a profit-making firm
and how about forests donate money to
orphanages if they see that these
children are living happily
so they manufacture appalling living
conditions for these children just to
evoke sympathy in tourists this is not
to say that any act of altruism would
end up in a disaster but these
experiences invite the question why why
does it sometimes go wrong when people
simply try to help other people the
problem isn&#39;t with the work these people
were doing the work these volunteers and
millions across the world are doing was
great a lot of you in the audience can
probably teach English better than
someone qualified teachers in rural
China libraries if they are well built
give kids a refuge and a source for
knowledge orphanages are often short
staffed and having volunteers to visit
making these field children making these
children feel cared for it does do good
for them it wasn&#39;t the work that was bad
it wasn&#39;t the volunteering that was bad
it was a people being there look at me I
am NOT half a doctor or engineer or
teacher or any other profession that
would allow me to design and implement
long-term sustainable solutions tailored
to communities in developing countries I
am a person who isn&#39;t really good at
teaching English to a kid who doesn&#39;t
speak any of my languages I am NOT very
good at singing songs that are four
times as old as I am to people in
retirement homes I can&#39;t really build a
brick water doesn&#39;t collapse and neither
can I paint the wall of a school neatly
imagine if you could spend the money you
used on that five day English teaching
trip
to hire local qualified teachers whose
monthly salary is a third of the cost of
your trip these teachers could actually
implement structured curriculum that
allow these students to develop language
abilities as opposed to having them
learn how to
after 10 again every time a new
volunteering group arrives imagine that
these kind-hearted people use the money
they spent to flatter Tanzania to hire
experienced local contractors to build
that library they would do it so much
faster safer better and of course the
income of these workers would as my
friend said stimulate the economy
imagine if you gave monetary support to
organizations that supported struggling
families and in Cambodia who are
contemplating whether or not to send
their children to an orphanage the
parents of these children could take
care of their own kids so much more
better than a group of volunteers who
only come for three days ever could
people are qualified are different
things I a 16 year old girl I&#39;m gonna
have many things I can persuade an
audience how a story maybe even start a
social media sensation
I am insightful about my own community
as a student I understand how some
students in Hong Kong face the problem
that of a lack in educational tools I
would see that when they face a school
work problem they wouldn&#39;t seek out help
from the internet but they might just
give up instead I also see that whenever
I taught these people how a particular
online tool could help them clarify a
math concept they would use it the next
time they had a problem these
experiences made me realise that the
problem with educational inequality
isn&#39;t that there is a lack of resources
because there are so many of them free
and existing and high-quality online it
is that there is a lack of awareness and
sometimes even the ability to access
these resources which is why I a few
friends a few friends and I started this
organization called edge you class that
helps young people learn about how they
can use these free educational resources
online serving the community and
contributing to a better Road comes in
forms there are people who work at the
forefront but there are also people who
work behind the scenes service doesn&#39;t
mean that everyone needs to get it teach
a kid English or build a library do what
you&#39;re good at
because that is exactly when you will be
able to make the biggest and best impact
you can on your community thank you
you
