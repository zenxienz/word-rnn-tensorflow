my name is David Wright and I am the
observations okay what the heck&#39;s and
observations how did I become an
observation what is this thing well it
started many years ago when I used to
listen quite often to the American
comedian George Carlin who gave me a
love of language now George Carlin had a
unique and often very colorfully worded
way of observing the world and I really
thought about what he was saying and how
he was making us look at the uniqueness
the paradoxes the absurdities of our
world and what that gave me aside from
the entertainment value and excuse to
listen to that language it was a keen of
awareness of how people observe the
world around them and process
information now at about the same time
as with many adolescents I became
interested in that not the part game but
performing feats of illusion
you know the vanishing napkin a card I
learned all those tricks that all the
kids learn and I got really good at and
I started performing at birthday parties
and annoying friends and family and
while I was learning all these tricks
and performing and making people&#39;s no I
just see that what was really that I was
doing now is it hand is quicker than the
eye I&#39;m gonna tell you it&#39;s actually not
in fact the slower and effect is
performed the more powerful it is
so I&#39;m looking and seeing what people
are think
how people are processing information I
started looking at people and not so
much observing the things about people
but developing an awareness through
observation of people how people process
information how people are in patterns
and don&#39;t really notice the things that
are going on around they often say that
you want to hide something hide in plain
sight that people are not going to
notice it so I started really studying
and involving myself in the analysis of
people and through my performances and
demonstrations and demonstrations and
experiments that&#39;s where I was going of
magic mentalism and yeah even hypnosis I
started looking at how people were going
through life and operating and behaving
without actually thinking in fact people
start to pay less attention to more
things now my goal here is there&#39;s some
entertainment some education and after
some enlightenment talk to you about how
you&#39;re observing the world and give you
some of the traditional and alternative
views of the reality which is really
just your belief system on Society has
said to you the differences in the
cultures what you&#39;re going to do based
on different stimulus now a lot of
people think today we&#39;re all hyper
observant I mean we have the internet we
are constantly connected our computers
we are walking around with our heads
buried in our cell phones social media
everything going on and all the time in
reality we&#39;re actually less observant so
here&#39;s one of my one of my examples you
ever drive down the motorway and you
shake yourself back into awareness and
find yourself five
ten miles downwards how the heck did
that just happen
and you&#39;re not terrified about this
woman now you might think I was zoning
out what was going on I could have died
there in reality that&#39;s a term we have
it&#39;s it&#39;s actually a state called
highway hypnosis now more than likely
especially because it did happen to you
you&#39;re here you&#39;ve arrived safely you
were aware of everything that was going
on we&#39;re conscious of it but you were
avoiding other drivers you were
maintaining your speed you weren&#39;t
veering into other lanes so you are
actually aware of what was going on but
you weren&#39;t truly conscious of the you
actually observe an other now I&#39;m going
to ask you to do something I&#39;m gonna ask
you to stare at this screen for five
seconds ready alright yeah what was the
color of the text of the instructions
what was the title of the slide what was
the color of the lines of the rectangles
well you thought I was gonna ask you how
many rectangles there were all I did was
asked you to look at the screen your
brain is filled in the rest we are
conditioned to take one piece of
stimulus and just start filling in
everything else through all of our life
experiences there&#39;s another example I
tend to do this I&#39;m not going to
advocate that you do this I haven&#39;t
gotten in trouble yeah from it but in
the United States the ATMs often
dispense currency in $20 bills and
you&#39;re out with friends you&#39;re out at a
restaurant you need to leave a tip you
want to split the bill you need smaller
denominations so you might ask the
waitstaff the bartender if they can give
you something smaller for its weight and
it&#39;s a common verbal exchange and it
often goes like this excuse me can you
break a 20 for me sure how would you
like that to ten to the five please okay
I see I see a couple of people on Friday
okay you realize what I just did
I just told me to give me $25 you have
no idea how many people without thinking
hand over to tens in a five give me the
money and I could just walk out the door
I have never done it myself as I&#39;ve
never done it right but I could have and
the look on their faces when I say do
you realize what you just did now as I
was doing I just did it for fun all the
time just as an experiment of
observation and I said how many people
are really doing this and
unscientifically I found about a quarter
of the people actually gave me the money
about half the people will actually go
to the drawer take out the money come
over to me either hand it to me or stop
me right after a just before and
something they don&#39;t know what it is
right they know there&#39;s something not
right there&#39;s something that they&#39;re
telling you they are still not observant
they&#39;re not realizing what was just said
to me so the well the final 25 percent

of the people I asked them for to 10:05
they go yeah really and at which point
we have we have a good laugh there&#39;s a
term we use for this several people use
different terms friend of mine calls it
selective perception I call it sensory
acuity you are acutely aware of what&#39;s
going on because you are observing the
world around you so what I want to do
now is an interactive experiment with
seven people in the audience and I&#39;m
going to ask you to write some things on
some cards and through observing you I
am going to figure out what each of you
wrote on these cards Sherlock Holmes Ian
type experiment I figured out we&#39;re
doing this in the UK let&#39;s go for it so
I&#39;m going to hand out four cards and
four sharpies and what I&#39;m going to ask
is think about where you grew up now
where you were born not where you live
now but where your formative years were
what how we won&#39;t brought up all right
if you moved around every two years
military family don&#39;t do that one
because what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m
going to observe you and I&#39;m going to
pick out which of you comfort in which
things on which parts so oops would be a
good idea if I give you guys the
sharpness wouldn&#39;t it okay
no I don&#39;t want to now I don&#39;t want to
see what you&#39;re writing down I want you
to write it down big and bold so when I
hold up other people can see it but the
turn over as soon as you&#39;re right okay
so I&#39;m not going to look okay write it
down quickly otherwise we&#39;re just
standing there right when you turn it
over okay you&#39;re just turned over all
four do sentence I promise I&#39;m not going
to do anything that&#39;s gonna mix them up
so I don&#39;t know which one is it
okay you&#39;re gonna turn over okay
hmm now looking at how everyone is
standing looking higher on yourself
looking at the way you&#39;re dressed and on
the chair next
sherburn boys if I gotta pronounce
properly right that&#39;s 50/50 shot looking
at how you&#39;re holding your hands do me a
favor if you see somebody that you
haven&#39;t seen walked into a part of the
way and you see someone across the room
they&#39;ve never seen them now this is not
going to be terribly exciting if I just
turn over the card and say this is where
you know this is who you are not
terribly excited something&#39;s a little
more difficult by looking at you and
I&#39;ve been observing you the whole time
even though I&#39;ve been wait wait a minute
but if you&#39;re if you&#39;re standing in a
conversation with somebody&#39;s small
circle of people you know some people
will cross their arms and you put their
hands in their pockets
some people put their hands behind their
back show me how you might ordinarily
stand but if it&#39;s the way you want right
now just say that I thought perhaps I
might have made the longest trip here I
think you might if you&#39;re not from here
I know that and I haven&#39;t heard you
speak and that was one of the things I
wanted to make sure not here anybody
speak because if I hear a French accent
definitely
I&#39;m not true the distance I think I may
have become the furthest but you might
have been from Moscow so that is how I
became in observations when we go
through life going through patterns
going through life without thinking of
what&#39;s going on giving people money
without thinking about it we miss more
than we actually see so how can you
change things how can you become more of
an observation break those patterns that
you&#39;ve been going through how can you
break those patterns simple when we&#39;re
done here today take a different route
home just however you were going to go
change up go to a restaurant you never
went to before put yourself force
yourself into a situation where you have
to pay attention otherwise you&#39;re going
to be given 25 pounds to everyone asking
you to prep to break your 20 not going
to be terribly good now there&#39;s a
concept that everybody&#39;s talking about
these days of mindfulness just being
present they often say just showing up
is half the battle if you just show up
you&#39;re going to miss all the wonderful
things in the world you need to show up
and actively be present actively observe
what&#39;s going on what I want you to walk
away with today is not to be scared of
the world nuts scam artists that are
going to try and you know take your
money not to be afraid of things but
rather with an enhanced view of the
world my gift to you today is sensory
acuity you&#39;re going to remember that
term you&#39;re going to look around and
you&#39;re gonna say I&#39;m gonna stop that I&#39;m
going to look at those things and I&#39;m
going to really be aware of what&#39;s going
on around me what&#39;s being asked of me
with that enhanced view of the world
you&#39;re going to accomplish more you&#39;re
going to enjoy more and by and through
observation you&#39;re going to be a much
more effective
