not anymore and you scaring these two
parts and the enemy found at the end of
the war zone in sales and you walked
from the stream or the witless masters
house now one of the boats was probably
made and did but there was other part
which high cracking it was a crackpot
and the water would eventually leak and
we never walked from the stream up to
the Masters house and this mentor
thought it was real so after pointing
the crack board finally myself that
because I because I keep in my capacity
you are losing out on your efforts on
your left words so you want to bet
almost finished I wanna crank board so
this compassionate man he told the crab
pot that I never notice the path that we
take from the stream to the Masters
house there are flowers going all on
your side of the path amount of the
outside I knew about your cross and I
wanted to be everything that you walk
towards the Masters house I had planted
seeds raw seeds and over two years your
pod you used to think water through it
it planted in what are all these seeds
and now we have class so how do you not
be a crackpot I
in his class Oscars table my story is
not much different from this crackpot my
father being the water better in my life
he planted the seeds of sportsmanship in
me and very young age he realized he saw
something in me which I myself didn&#39;t
see he my disability was never limited
in his eyes I was introduced to cricket
at the age of six I was taking the coach
and the coach not this futile hope you
boys may be so coach give me a bag and
start when he wasn&#39;t me play cricket for
the first time my order to his grave all
of this history swinging my back and on
connecting one ball I failed at the age
of six hours facing failure then leaving
I went back home and my father tells me
to use what you have be with it so my
father died improvised as well of you so
bad and how to use my own crackpot we
need to my advantage so that&#39;s how I
started fighting them so I&#39;m using my
right now as a support mechanism to fell
straight drive or a cover drive of will
select the type of into the cover so
that&#39;s how I started
I start going to coach every week
trading practicing for ten years of
training here practicing finding one
there&#39;s something really wonderful
happened I got selected to represent my
people for the under-16 team it hasn&#39;t
been the only smaller of men and even
have talked to me to represent my school
for swimming basketball dance last year
also dry rot surfing skiing deep sled
you must be think I&#39;m crazy my father
remove all this I have nothing else to
do my life actually was crazy
this is bangle traffic on our wooden
this is crazy this is crazy and this is
the reason why I started cycling it
would take me on Muslims on a daily
basis to come here to work so because of
it should I give up on the traffic I was
being the traffic rather than being
stuck in traffic so I got out got a bite
and I started riding to work so cyclist
has to go through a scientist has to go
through around with resistance and to
move forward you have to push to a mass
of air in front of you which takes
energy so I realize that I think I have
two legs to pump in the energy I have
one less out to be my aerodynamic soul
and save a percent okay let me do this
white one so this my dear spot and then
I start cycling I subsequently got in
touch with the other kind of foundation
this foundation promotes and enables our
bodies differently abled civilians and
our personnel to take up sports and have
self-worth of all kind of sports
requirement so going to touch with them
send you my queries is my own questions
and asking for Association if I put I
with them and in no time they are
separated then I became a master for the
sale in five months time or started to
write I took up the challenge to go from
Manali to Keylong and I start doing heel
trainings in manhood self to see if I
can catch myself the whole reason of
doing this to us I will see how far
could I push myself how far can I move
and go beyond my limits to fight against
me I
is the weather please the highest water
will go to the world and so it happened
we went through Manali took our doula
and it makes you go through a lot of
pain and suffering let me tell you that
because heavy Clank burns your legs it
shoots your heart rates up to 180 and
Beyond and you know in those times of
complete utter despair is when I really
found my one you never consciousness
over the whole universe spent which I
didn&#39;t know I had and that&#39;s the reason
why we all like each other China system
we titled friends because they might be
scary they might look like an enemy but
they all our friends in disguise they
help us grow it help us become stronger
away ever since childhood every spot
that I&#39;ve played I have always wanted to
represent the country it&#39;s crazy I
visualized it all like standing on the
podium with international international
going normally in flag diversity with
the many being put on the table - okay I
visualized it so clearly that I still
chase the dream to this very day
and earlier this year in fact I got a
call from the formation saying that the
Cycling Federation of India the CFI
is willing to send if you had the means
to bargain for the issue Palestine in
temperature right across the and I want
to assume it for me and in a week&#39;s time
we have a tryouts in Hyderabad eight
people who are shortlisted I was one of
them
then the contingent we defer by on the
great second or fell on the 25th of
February SOP I have to talk about
monetize to control the weather along
the track and while it is sitting at the
hotel reception be watching at the other
and engine is smoking and your skin they
complete the fitness levels realer than
us anything
yeah intermediate us were Beauty state
but all that I had remained on that
point was would would would would one
day at the for the base there was the
classification at the medical check-up
state where the mental focus SPO blood
samples and the test people classify you
in her so R Academy so when he in
contingent with the new happy needs
friend that there were already noticed
that there was a lot of argument going
on at the end officials who I think if
they concluded saying that we cannot win
this indefinitely participate but we
won&#39;t be allowed to win it even if
you&#39;re the best we still gonna get to
get on the scale for you it was before
the race that we cannot warn you we work
force only ones are efforts of money on
postman waiting so if you call to be
able to see a pioneer and we cleared it
out tonight with the organizers and
there was some miscommunication
so it turns out that were on one of
situation the poetical
the pneumatics of the independent
country to participate on a regular
basis and the world over it permitted to
win the medicine the next day was our
race is completely over the entire race
so the court said look I didn&#39;t mean he
was telling us a lot more about it than
those rats he was mentioned I was the
first one to start over and the whistle
or any was is gold gold gold that was
the only thing we have in mind it was a
very sunny day but oh very very windy
they invited that day where we had very
strong head winds and strong crosswinds
so I did start off pretty well with my
average speeds around 43 44 km/h but in
no time when the wind started hitting me
and pulling it only on one side we
hadn&#39;t they&#39;ll be meeting here on the
right and the left it gets a little
boring when it&#39;s a strong crosswind so

the speeds drop it 39:37
you know motivation is probably the
remotest of least of these method orders
some and then mine ain&#39;t no momentum
walk I started you steam and up on the
stands I saw this one gentleman standing
with one fly God say pain is temporary
Facebook posts up
[Music]
strategically placed placed mid-range
motivation loft of looking at this and I
start sprinting again finished my right
in 21 minutes and I don&#39;t know who start
an impactful hour for the next person is
so if I&#39;m always people not the next
person was a little more than winning so
I had recently I&#39;m pasting and then I
started to do it for the next and the
next rider I tell you this it&#39;s not
advisable to do math when your heart is
pumping and 180s
operator once all the Tigers came in we
were asked to move was affordable and
that&#39;s when the auction started off
Braun&#39;s position and wait from not bank
ain&#39;t medals at all not being permitted
to win we went on with all the three
medicines and then the part of my dream
style would unfold we asked around the
podium the pendants will be put on okay
was given and then this team on a
foreign land
we&#39;re going in national anthem being
somewhere in with the flags being
hoisted clean influx in hoisted and the
Shaykh standing close by this same price
[Applause]
raining we years ago my life took a turn
when I met with an accident
I was at my grandmother&#39;s place my
mother that was playing with her people
aeroplanes I was not playing that&#39;s all
it&#39;ll prove it I am other than my
cousins were inside the lift because of
collapse immediately free organic my
English ought to know and while they
were inside and what the doors are shut
both the gates were shut up American
wood and asking them to please make a
buoy no so please go ahead
I&#39;m not paying them and I had my moment
somebody from the ground floor press the
button so they went out and I work with
fellow Ramona&#39;s got all of the ways and
undercooking ended there was only like
the only iron I think the whole shock of
the event about the pain at that moment
I walked back and said my grandmother
saying that
what happened and then I fainted because
of blood loss the next moment I woke up
I was on the hospital bed with my with
the eyes I look at my almond eyes so
that is all vanity the few accidents
happen for a reason the pot wasn&#39;t crack
if they would have been able to take the
class roster and I thought was my arm I
would have still be stuck in traffic we
get back home right now it doesn&#39;t
matter what you don&#39;t have
what really matters is what you have and
what you can do with it I here as able
to support by including he said that
pains pain broken is broken but the only
thing which may be really disabled you
is fear conclude my talk and I can tell
you that something will grow from all
that you&#39;re going through and it will be
you
