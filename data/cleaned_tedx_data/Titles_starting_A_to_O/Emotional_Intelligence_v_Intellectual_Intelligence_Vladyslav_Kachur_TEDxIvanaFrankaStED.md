hello everyone are you ready I&#39;m the
last one thank you for your patience
let&#39;s applause ourselves we are great
so today Ted Ted no Todd tall told us
about six hours marathon I can conclude
congratulate you because we have already
overcome seven hours marathon so
educating your mind without educating
your heart is not education at all this
idea was expressed by one of the
greatest educators of all times
Aristotle I suppose that that man even
didn&#39;t imagine that he would become a
father of a so called holistic approach
to education the approach which
undermines us as educators to develop
the whole child that is he is emotional
and cognitive dimensions speaking with
the terminology of modern pedagogics we
are going to talk about EQ and IQ let&#39;s
revise some basics of these two concepts
so IQ is the ability to learn understand
and apply information to skills to world
formation to logical reasoning maths
skills abstract and spatial thinking if
we speak about in emotional intelligence
or EQ we speak about our ability to
identify to assess and to control the
emotions of oneself of others and of
groups and David Goldman identified four
main domains of EQ they are self
self-awareness self-management empathy
and social skills which of these
intelligences is more important
when I&#39;m thinking about it I throws me
back to my childhood which I call the
era of Tom and Jerry I really like that
cartoon and I couldn&#39;t understand one
thing why those cute animals were
constantly quarreling and that small and
impudent mouse Jerry tortured a big and
unlucky Tom one day when I came to the
kindergarten my friend told me you know
Jerry is so kind that kid that he can&#39;t
rid of Tom and Tommy so stupid that he
cannot catch Jerry the logics of
children is very very simple but when
when now when I&#39;m adult I can say that
Tom had a low IQ level and Jerry had a
low EQ level and if their levels of
intelligences were high they would they
would put up together quite great
personally I think that emotional
intelligence is initial and now we&#39;ll
make a kind of experiment I want you to
close your eyes and relax don&#39;t be
afraid I&#39;m not going to hypnotize you
yeah cause your eyes and relax
think about the brightest moments from
your childhood your parents care bluelab
eyes fairy tales your favorite toys can
you feel the taste of your very sweet
I hear somebody snoring wake up so thank
you I saw a lot of smiles on your faces
why our childhood is connected with
positive emotions we as children
perceived a lot of information through
our inner world our feelings let us
speak about our school teachers I hope
and I know exactly that all
you remember a couple of them and that&#39;s
not because of their knowledge they
shared with you it&#39;s because of the
feelings you experienced their lessons i
completely agree with Angela with Maya
Angelou who said people will forget what
you said people will forget what you did
but they will never forget how you made
them feel I have a very typical
situation for a teacher I have been
working as a teacher of English and
German for almost 10 years and when it
come to a new 5th graders class they
have already finished just primary
school I have a few students who are
afraid of learning my subject why maybe
I&#39;m a Frankenstein no I&#39;m not maybe they
are stupid
no I observe and I consider every every
pupil every student to be a talented
child the reason is in their previous
negative experience it really takes
place and stereotypes which were imposed
by previous teacher and I have a really
really hard task the task is to change
their attitude to my subject from
negative to positive it&#39;s really hard
you know I have am deeply convinced that
our IQ skills can be blocked by EQ
skills I mean by our emotional quote
quotient negative emotions they prevent
children from learning my subject so I
have to find the key to effective
learning what is that and ideas good job
thank you motivation how to motivate our
students there are two ways one of them
is well-known
teacher as a tamer with a whip who
hasn&#39;t learned my subject here I&#39;ll
teach you how to learn I was a victim of
such teacher yes I learned this object
but it was not learning it was cramming
with negative attitude towards it and I
hate that subject what are the other
ways today I see here the teachers of
21st century and all of you have your
own keys to a child as for me I think
that we have to remember to keep in mind
the needs of our children in 1991 Tom
Hutchinson and Alan waters presented a
six-fold conception of motivation and it
includes six needs which we have to
satisfy during our lessons the need for
exploration the need for manipulation
the need for mental and physical
activity the need for self expression
the need for knowledge and the need for
ego enhancement if I as a teacher
satisfy at least half of them be sure my
students will be motivated to come to my
lessons and to learn my subject to do
that in a proper way when I start when I
started my teaching career I&#39;m carried
out an experiment the matter is that I
have been learning a humanistic approach
for almost 10 years the main idea is we
should combine positive experience of
our students with learning process and
I&#39;ve developed the set of humanistic
tasks they are different because except
of learning goal I have an emotional go
effective goal which is directed at the
development of some EQ skills on my
students and I chose 13 14 year olds you
know they are known for their low
motivation teenagers are always like
that and I carried out
an experimental learning for one month
when I compared their pre experimental
and post experimental results the
average progress was by 15% isn&#39;t that
impressive
it was academic success which
demonstrated the level of EQ skills of
my students and their readiness to learn
and here you can see so-called scape
principle which I use at my lessons what
is mean scape sharing caring acceptance
positive thinking and evaluation at
first we have to create a special
environment for our students principle
number one we have to create what the
climate of acceptance and I to create
this safe and encouraging atmosphere I
use principle number one everyone has
the right to make the mistakes when I
enter the classroom and I say you are
welcome to make mistakes today the
expression it was then what what do you
mean crazy teacher making mistakes haha
we don&#39;t believe you the problem is that
they treat mistakes in the wrong way but
after a while when I changed their
attitude to mistake as something really
necessary to make progress and when they
are ready to be in this climate of
acceptance their places are like that
yeah it&#39;s cool I make mistake I make
progress the next principle is the
principle of a pink elephant I have the
question is it possible for an ordinary
human being to eat a big fat pink
elephant if you think it&#39;s possible
raise your hand nobody thinks it&#39;s
possible if you think is impossible
raise your hand
yeah the answers can differ but still it
is
piece by piece every day yum-yum-yum
yes you will do it maybe in two months
mainly in half a year
maybe in two years but you will do it I
have to set a clear goal and I have to
encourage my student climate of
acceptance is about setting the proper
psychological atmosphere in the
classroom how I do that I use any
charges warm-ups icebreakers I break
stereotypes now you will see one of the
examples of that I want you to give me
the reason I am often rapping at my
lessons I use military rap you know what
yeah something like that
and now I&#39;ll rap in a way as MC Jason
Levine das so just give me the rhythm
[Applause]
the microphone I take took taken you
shake shook shaken listen to the music
in the style I&#39;m creating Doody done
begin begin begun listen to the lesson
that they teach Tok Tok so we usually
stay in a circle and the matter is that
rhyme is not important in military up
you can you can rap about everything and
they encouraged they see each other
doing the same things the spirit of team
so next time sharing after I set the
climate of acceptance sharing takes
place what does it mean they share their
thoughts their experiences they share as
they are ideas and they take the biggest
risk for teenagers the risk of being
themselves it&#39;s not easy because you are
afraid that somebody in the class will
make fun of you but if you set a good
climate of acceptance that won&#39;t happen
at first the the level of their self
acceptance grows then their self-esteem
grows and delve then we have an a
wonderful magic happening their
self-confidence grows and they are not
afraid of speaking English and the last
pillar for providing of that environment
is caring caring is good thing and I
like it why because of one thing is
educational symbiosis I call it so what
does it mean I use peer teaching peer
education and peer tutoring at my
lessons they have to be ready for that
when they work for example when they do
some projects together I usually do it
in the way when the pupils of different
levels can work together they have their
tasks and when they feel the
responsibility for other person they are
ready to sacrifice their time
and they&#39;re ready to sacrifice some of
the most important thing for them for
example some of their hobby time as well
sports time it&#39;s set from and you can
see that at the bottom of that is
positive thinking and evaluation
positive thinking a very good thing what
can you see there at the screen in eight
years yeah I dropped a drop of mod Oh
anything else oh yeah good thing thank
you when I take a white sheet of paper
and show it to my students the answers
are the same but actually no one notices
the whiteness of the sheet and everyone
sees that muddy tiny dot in the center
of it thinking about positive thinking
yes we should remember that we have to
shift the focus and what I do I
emphasize the strengths of my students
if cooking lessons can do it I do that
if rapping and the lessons can do it I
do that if dancing and singing can do it
I do that one more important thing is
that we have to remember that
responsibility for good self confidence
is not only our school responsibility is
the responsibility of parents as well
I&#39;ve been a class leader for nine or
eight years and I observed one situation
a very tone man
daddy scolded at his child it was like
that you were good why why why have you
got the two in biology
the child was like Puss in Boots you
know I had a private talk with that dad
and I asked only three questions the
first one was who gives birth to cows he
looked at me who cows yeah man cows
who what animal gives birth to horses
and he started to suspect something
horses you think I&#39;m poor my knowledge
on oil geez poor I don&#39;t know anything
about reproduction horses
the third question was can you guess
what what animal gives birth to goats
and then the expression on his face
changed
he has already he has just called his
son a goat so thinking and the things we
taught tell our to our students are
really important and if you name them
goats at 200 times they will believe
that they&#39;re goats and they will act
according to the stereotype you&#39;ve put
on them so an evaluation at affiliation
I usually use this sandwich principle
giving feedback is very important for
them positive negative positive but
under negative I undermine constructive
feedback we do not say you made mistake
there there we usually give some pieces
of advice I would improve that or that
aspect and it works I usually do that
after public speaking my students they
usually prepare some public speeches and
we analyze them afterwards we strap
their progress we stress the things we
like and it&#39;s really motivating for them
to make the progress as well so speaking
about all the 21st century let us
remember that as Steinbach John
Steinbeck said that teaching is one of
the greatest arts in the world because
we deal with human soul let us remember
that and let us take this challenge to
preserve human soul with the best and
positive feelings with good
self-confidence in such cases
I usually remind myself the words of st.
Francis of Assisi which
start doing the things which are
necessary then do the things which are
possible and in the end all of a sudden
you discover that you do impossible
things
so keep calm and teach on and be super
teachers of the 21st century thank you
for your attention
[Applause]
