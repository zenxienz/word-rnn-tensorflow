I am a feminist I&#39;m a proud vocal
unashamed feminist so when you think
about feminism what comes to mind do you
think about de la Mina&#39;s women fighting
for reproductive rights or maybe about
women fighting for the vote or maybe
even bra-burning
which by the way didn&#39;t take place to me
feminism is about female empowerment
feminism is about having the same
opportunities and chances in life as men
have and not being held back by the mere
fact that we were born female to me
feminism looks like this and like this
and even like this that&#39;s a little
unexpected right romans novels and
feminism a lot of people would like us
to believe that these through on
opposite ends but what if I told you
that everything you think you know about
Romans novels is wrong I am a feminist
and until I was studying at university I
too believed the lie that there was
nothing as unfeminist of Romans novels
that was until I ran into this quote by
Mara maha Rodale Romans novels have been
and still are too dangerous books that
show women again and again that they&#39;re
worth it to me this changed the world
because really most people think of
things like this when they think of
Romans
novels and yeah that the covers with the
flowy hand women with bosoms nearly
falling out of too tight dresses and men
hawking over them grabbing them the two
things that come to mind generally
aren&#39;t feminism and strong female heroes
but would you be surprised if I told you
that actually these covers are a
marketing ploy these covers were created
for the store owners that would be
selling these books because Romans
publishers early on realized that if
they wanted their books in the hands of
as many women as possible they had to
sell them at grocery stores and at the
time the people running the grocery
stores were largely men so they did the
one thing that they thought would work
really well they appealed to the male
sexual fantasy and it worked it works so
well but right now
romance is a single largest fictional
fiction genres sold worldwide on Amazon
today at this moment
40% of all ebooks old Romans novels and
if you didn&#39;t know that I&#39;m not
surprised I didn&#39;t know it at first
either but for a book that is generally
thought of as inconsequential or fluff
that&#39;s quite a range 40% of all ebooks
and Romans novels are largely written by
women for women about women and their
lives lies that throughout history have
largely been ignored our stories our
footnotes in the stories of men if were
lucky but not in Romans novels Romans
novels talks to women in Romans novels
women are
heroes and this puts Rome&#39;s novels in
the unique position to talk about things
that really matter to women
Rome&#39;s novels were able to talk about
controversial topics like birth control
interracial relationships or simply the
right to marry who you want but Eva
closer to home things like leaving
abusive relationships overcoming mental
health issues or even sexual freedom and
I would like to make a note on this idea
of romance novels and sex because Romans
novels are often discarded as not as
good literature often because of the sex
in them explicit sex on the page but
really showing female positive
portrayals of female sexuality that have
nothing to do with the male gaze or a
virgin slut paradigm how can that be bad
in a world where we are constantly
bombarded by images of male sexuality in
celebrating that I refuse I refuse to be
shamed for reading positive portrayals
of female sexuality and Romans wouldn&#39;t
exist without women saying I refuse
because there&#39;s no story in a woman who
follows what Society of wants of her
Romans novels feature women with dreams
and aspirations that are beyond what her
family or society would like her to do
so she will go for that dream and along
the way she may find a partner male or
female who will not only love her for
her dreams but who will support her
every step of the way and she will sir
her partner every step of the way - and
this supportive system that Romans talks
about does not just take place inside
the books
Romans authors have for centuries been
able to be financially independent of
their husbands of their families and
even if their husbands were to gamble or
drink away the family funds she was able
to keep them off the streets she was
able to keep her family out of the poor
houses to financially support her family
and I&#39;m one of them I am a Roman soldier
I live this same dream the same lives as
so many women have before me and so many
women will after me we write I am a
feminist and I&#39;m a Roman soldier and I
do not believe that Romans novels are
oppressive or inconsequential
I believe that stories about women
taking life into their own hands taking
their destiny into their own hands I
believe that that is at its core
feminist even if romance does not use
words like feminism or female
empowerment their core ideas of women
who aspire to something and who will do
everything in their power to get there I
believe that is feminist I believe there
is nothing more feminist there&#39;s no
fictional genre more feminist than
Romans novels so if you need a little
pick-me-up or a little bit extra
encouragement or if you simply need
something comforting to read men
anyone who needs just a little extra
just a little extra love read a romance
novel thank you
