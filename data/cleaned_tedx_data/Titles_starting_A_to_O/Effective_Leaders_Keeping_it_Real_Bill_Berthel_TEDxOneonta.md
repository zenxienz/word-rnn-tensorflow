thank you
I was an over optimistic leader and what
I mean by that is that I over relied on
optimism in my leadership approach i
over relied on positive thinking and now
you might be saying to yourself how
could someone over rely on positive
thinking right we tell ourselves all the
time keep thinking positive an
interesting blind spot occurs in
emotional intelligence for some leaders
when they over utilize optimism we avoid
negativity and those people that present
it to us the effect is that we leave
those people behind and I have to admit
every once in a while I still slip back
especially when I want things to work
out really well I like optimism don&#39;t
get me wrong and I love positive
thinking but I think sometimes the
pendulum swings too far and what we
really want is balance in reality I&#39;m
reminded what Christopher Peterson and
Lisa Bozzio share in their book health
and optimism is that optimism is not an
exercise in fantasy but a reality based
belief system I like that a reality
based belief system as a leadership
coach I&#39;ve come to rely on a method or a
technique that allows me to suspend
judgment temporarily let me share a
little bit about that with you
we have the positive negative dichotomy
good bad right wrong
those are immediate judgments and that
circumvents the ability to fully process
emotional responses if we temporarily
replace the positive negative good bad
dichotomy with an anabolic catabolic
dichotomy it allows us time to fully
process
those terms are borrowed from biology
we&#39;re anabolic means building or
constructing an additive process
and catabolic means decoupling
deconstructing a subtractive process
neither is good or bad until we apply it
in context so it allows us when
considering emotional and psychological
energy to suspend judgment temporarily
digging deeper into those emotional
responses this simple concept really
helps us uncover some of our own blind
spots
you know what judgment is important
knowing if something&#39;s good or bad or
dangerous is very important evolutionary
science suggests that we are naturally
inclined to a negative bias and this
probably has rewarded our species as
we&#39;ve evolved imagine our prehistoric
predecessors walking through the jungle
or the forest or wherever they were in
their environment and they they come
across a brand new creature never before
seen and it&#39;s big and it&#39;s hairy and it
has teeth and it has claws and they
approach it with huh I bet he&#39;s friendly
I&#39;m going to see what that&#39;s all about
right only to find out that their first
encounter with a lion or a bear or
whatever that beast was would be their
last so having that negative bias really
does help us survive in the world but I
wonder as we continue to evolve how much
avoiding negativity is helping us or not
once you&#39;re a little personal story with
you in my early career I took a position
as a quality control technician and that
job is full of judgment pass/fail that
was ultimately my job was to say is the
product in spec and if I did my job
really well I didn&#39;t have to worry about
the customer doing that job finding out
if the product was in spec or not but
every once while that happened every
once in a while a customer complaint
would come in and so I got to be part of
that complaint department and I say that
now I got to be part of that there was
an opportunity but then I came to a
little fork in the
rode and thought about yogi Berra&#39;s
wisdom he shares when you come to a fork
in the road you should take it and I
think we usually think about that
statement as any action other than
inaction is good
I think Beres wisdom was suggesting that
when binary thinking presents itself we
have the ability to make a third choice
there&#39;s a great spectrum of gray between
black and white
so at that time I took the opportunity
to see those complaints as potential
gifts as indicators of what might be
wrong with our product and listened
fully to those complaints and those
became opportunities for product
improvements and absolutely satisfying
our customer it could have been easy to
avoid that negativity we often think
optimism is the answer that we just need
to think positive or keep thinking our
way to a positive success the Gallup
agency in their recent book first break
all the rules they were seeking to
understand what was the difference
between good leaders and excellent
leaders the overarching answer is that
they humanize the experience and make
their followers feel wanted and
important but digging a little deeper
into I think two decades of data almost
a billion data points from the Gallup
agency&#39;s polls and surveys on leadership
and employee engagement they learned
something very important excellent
leaders knew when to give up they knew
when to give up for themselves and for
their people and the key to that was
identifying real talents not positive
thinking their way to success at
something they weren&#39;t so good at they
would identify their real talents for
themselves and the people that were
following them
and optimize those talents on the team
they really had a realistic perspective
there Ken Robinson fellow TED talk
presenter educator and author shares
that there are two kinds of people in
the world those that split the world
into two kinds of people and those that
don&#39;t and well I think that&#39;s hilarious
I think there are three kinds of people
I think there are optimists pessimists
and realists EE or the donkey from we
need the Pooh has come to represent that
classic pessimist so he&#39;s got that great
cloud over him he kind of has that
attitude of nothing ever goes right
nothing ever will he tries and he&#39;s
pretty witty at times but as Tigger
shares and Tigger is a high optimist as
Tigger shares a or has a penchant for
gloomy ruminations and speaking of those
high optimists like Tigger often quite
full of themselves full of energy
bounding about with goals but missing
the cues of almost everyone around them
the good the bad the indifferent just
missing all of that I think Winnie the
Pooh represents the realist he has a
goal an obsession for honey and despite
that obsession
he always has time for any of the other
characters whether they&#39;re not feeling
well whether they have negativity or
whether they&#39;re optimistic I think the
real leader in the story is a little boy
named Christopher Robin he&#39;s imagining
this for his playthings perhaps
daydreaming
but providing a balanced community for
his playthings to thrive and live in you
know I have a little boy at home who was
only six years old and I think I&#39;ve
learned more about leadership from him
than any other experience of my life
so highly optimistic leaders have this
blind spot in emotional intelligence
emotional intelligence is the ability to
understand your own emotions process
them and know what to do them to be know
what to do with them to be effective
that expands out into social emotional
intelligence where we can read the cues
and the emotions of other people process
them and know what to do with them to
make the event or the situation as good
as it can be high optimistic leaders
often are unable to process the
negativity I&#39;m concerned with that not
for the Lions and the Bears in the world
but for the leaders and the people and
the teams that follow them the talents
of those individuals who might be
expressing some negativity through a
pessimistic view often get left out
neglected or avoided and I think that&#39;s
a shame I think their contribution being
missed is problematic James Stockdale
Admiral James Stockdale was the
highest-ranking military officer to be
taken captive and a prisoner of war camp
in Vietnam he noticed something pretty
quickly upon his imprisonment
considering pessimists optimists and
realists who do you think fared best and
most often survived these hellish camps
well Stockdale wanted to understand that
as he entered these camps he wanted to
know that for himself so he could
survive and if there was any opportunity
as a leader to help others survive he
noticed that the pessimists were
defeated immediately they had no hope
they had no strategy and their greatest
fears came to fruition and unfortunately
perished quickly he noticed the high
optimists were close behind they had
hope as a strategy and as beautiful as
hope is it&#39;s not a strategy
they would tell themselves things like
we&#39;ll be saved by Christmas and
Christmas would come and go and they&#39;d
still be captive and then they would
tell themselves things like we&#39;ll be
saved by Easter and Easter would come
and go and they would still be captive
and these cycles of high hopes and being
let down eventually went to their parish
as well sadly the realists however were
able to hold a paradox the paradox was
we are absolutely living in Hell there&#39;s
almost no human dignity and it&#39;s the
worst place in the world to be and yet
I&#39;m going to hold on to any shreds of
decency I have and my own mindset at the
same time I held that paradox and
survived more frequently by being real
with themselves
it&#39;s exactly what Stockdale did
Stockdale actually went to the place in
his own mind to say if and when I get
out of here I&#39;m going to make this the
most meaningful experience in my life so
I learn and grow from it not from hope
not from fear but by being real with
himself in my work as a leadership coach
I&#39;ve noticed some common traits of very
effective leaders and I&#39;d like to share
those with you today one they confront
their emotions they don&#39;t neglect their
emotions they&#39;re not avoiding their
emotions they&#39;re able to celebrate and
sit with a difficulty and pain of a
situation they allow that full process
by - suspending judgment at least
temporarily they know that an answer or
a solution may not be the immediate need
they understand that going right to a
judgment good bad right wrong let&#39;s do
this thing
let&#39;s not could circumvent the
opportunity to process more fully and to
include more people in the process if
necessary they&#39;re vulnerable
they talk about their emotional
responses
they listen fully and they share fully
whether that&#39;s difficult or whether it&#39;s
a celebration they&#39;re vulnerable and
they practice a more advanced skill set
called detached involvement and let me
explain that to you they go into very
difficult situations with the internal
mindset of saying I am going to be
involved but I&#39;m going to detach myself
from owning the other person&#39;s
difficulty negativity or pain that is a
form of emotional armor yet they still
stay involved they don&#39;t put the armor
on and go away they&#39;re willing to go
into the exchange and lead so now what
I&#39;d like to ask you as leaders in all
walks of life whether that be business
politics the arts religion in families
in parenting
be vulnerable share your authentic self
with everyone you can start small start
where the stakes are low and build on
that practice inter and intra empathy
start with yourself
empathize for yourself the emotions that
you&#39;re having are valid and worthy start
their process them and understand them
and then do that for others you know one
of my proudest moments as a leader was
having a particularly pessimistic
negative individual come to me and say
you know I never have a good thing to
say it you&#39;re always willing to listen
and you want to know what I&#39;m thinking
and the answer was well you have good
things to say once we get past the
initial message you share they had
contributions they had talents I didn&#39;t
want to miss
in closing negativity is a gift it tells
us that something is wrong it&#39;s a signal
that there&#39;s potential danger or perhaps
something that we should be thinking
about changing optimism and positivity
is a gift as well it motivates us it&#39;s
encouraging it boosts morale and it&#39;s
that energy that keeps us moving forward
however I think balance is the greatest
gift of all if we&#39;re able to have the
optimists and the realists come together
include the pessimists and the
negativity we get the full experience
that&#39;s possible so I simply ask you as
leaders and whatever walk of life you&#39;re
in please keep it real thank you
[Applause]
you
