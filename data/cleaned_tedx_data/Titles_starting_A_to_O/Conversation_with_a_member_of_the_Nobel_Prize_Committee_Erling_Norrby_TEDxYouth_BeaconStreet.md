thank you so much for joining us today
Earling Norby it did I see that right
that&#39;s okay okay so welcome to America
it&#39;s it&#39;s so you know what&#39;s the flight
across the Atlantic Lindbergh and the
spirit of st. Louis there was a prize
involved for that but that was an
incentive to try to create innovation
the legacy of the nobel prize like where
would society be today if there was no
nobel prize and this is not the peace or
economics the the physiology chemistry
the medicine go back in time revisionist
history where would we be do you think
so it&#39;s a remarkably old price the first
price boat delivered in 1901 and that
was a time you know of national
chauvinist tendency to come back in
history so the Swedish King was not very
happy when Alfred Nobel decided that
should be given to a scientist
disregarding whether he was canon avian
or not so it&#39;s one of the first
international prize and science by
definition is national knowledge knows
no borders and knowledge is something
that we&#39;re proud of in the human
civilization the way it grows and then
there was some important points made in
the India testimony namely that it
should be given for a discovery so you
have to think about what is a discovery
the first invention and then depends
upon the on the study but this that the
word discoveries is no process but in
physics is discovery or an invention in
chemistry discovery or an improvement
and in medicine it is in fact physiology
or medicine
so it&#39;s both biology and pathology the
way things not functioning well and but
again it was and in medicine it&#39;s only
for discoveries so we need to think
about it though so this beginner for
modern Hardy in fact mu this year the
hundred nine Nobel Prize in Physiology
or medicine and they cover of course the
whole field of medicine and recently I
gave
of course about the advance of medicine
using Nobel Prizes add add to a way
marks and it&#39;s fantastic how it
describes an incredible journey in
knowledge that we have taken in medicine
medicine 1900 and medicine 2017 two
completely different worlds think about
just the disease like polio myelitis
most of you have forgotten that there&#39;s
such a disease but before 1950s this was
a dominating disease and Aaron&#39;s worried
each autumn that maybe it&#39;s a lot of
lung young-shin it&#39;s going to be
paralyzed for life and today with
vaccines that we have we are very close
to completely eliminating this disease
from the world and think about it
infectious agents they don&#39;t care about
artificial human hongkong structs like
board spinning countries there are no
borders in this world we have just the
one world and infectious agents know
that they spread across this board so if
we are going to eradicate a disease it&#39;s
a global effort it&#39;s a joint effort and
if you want to make America great you&#39;re
going to make the world great because
that&#39;s how you can demonstrate this is a
time when I think we need more science
and than ever and it&#39;s interesting your
role in the Nobel Prizes just so the
audience knows you&#39;re a distinguished
virologist the smallest infectious agent
incredible journey but you know
accumulating knowledge new ways of
identifying effective stages new and
ways of introducing vaccines we taking
away childhood diseases in addition to
Paulie and so forth and also if there is
a flare-up on a new rather threatening
infection we have the tools there again
globally to identify it to take the
proper epidemiological measures and and
use the tool so let me ask you this too
you were in the room when a lot of the
discussions on who should get the prize
for the coming year and the way the
Nobel will was written and is a
gentleman who had many inventions one of
them dynamite and he left his money for
these prizes I read something that he
had seen in obituary for his brother who
they thought they were writing his
obituary and they said the merchant of
death and this was eight years earlier
before he died and maybe that helped him
to say wait a second
instead of I want to do good with the
money I&#39;ve made from dynamite so what&#39;s
it like in the room when people are
debating who should get the three prizes
and who do you think got it that in
retrospect you don&#39;t think should have
gotten it and who do you think didn&#39;t
get it who should have gotten it and am
i right that it&#39;s only for the last year
so if something was really profound that
people missed a decade earlier and it
wasn&#39;t discovered or invented in the
last twelve months is it off the table
so I asked you like eighteen questions
there but you&#39;re pretty smart I bet you
picked picked the the ones you think are
good there so Nobel was an idealist yes
he made a lot of money he didn&#39;t have a
family and he would buy this I could
make a difference but this money but his
idea originally was to identify that
person thirty five forty years old
giving this sizeable sum of money
equivalent to some twenty years salary
or so which is a good really concentrate
on this that however is not what came to
be a right it&#39;s in the 50s it there so
so it says in the will it should be
given for something that been discovered
the previous year but we need much
longer time to see what what has an
impact and what is a true discovery so
we kind of reformulated that and said
that that the previous year we have
understood the impact of this discovery
so yes I&#39;ve been privileged to be a part
of this and I became people stand up and
get really heated did furniture get
thrown but it&#39;s people sell videos and
videos so I became professor and
chairman in virology in 72 and the 73 I
became a member of the Nobel Committee
but in fact we have a committee that is
composed of five members and then ten
adjunct members so the 15 people working
this and then that correspond to the
decision is taking about what today is
called the Nobel assembly 50 people it&#39;s
a good combination the medical field is
very large very diverse so we need to
have these 15 people if I were a newer
one in those 15 yeah that&#39;s right for
for more than 20 years and if I would
did you speak the least about this
middle or the most you know well you can
speculate but I certainly was very
outspoken and and the field I was
representing I mean infectious diseases
and and also I quite familiar with
molecular biology and so these were feet
that were advanced with enormous
strength so I was I was involved in many
different ways in their very belief
about this built repetition is that this
is a very careful work and I won&#39;t be
laborat that but we have nominations to
the end of January we start the work
with the committee and if you make
in-depth analysis and reviews and at
that time was made by members of the
community and in in August we gather all
this review and it&#39;s a book about 400
pages with all these reviews and that is
the what we use resilient Swedish or
it&#39;s all in Swedish and that&#39;s a reason
when I write this book I have this
advantage of Swedish is my national
tongue yeah although United States my
second home country so I take that
English is my second time so I feel like
you&#39;re avoiding the question I asked who
who should have gotten the prize that
didn&#39;t okay and who got the prize and
you think well hmm maybe maybe it was
not the right choice okay so this these
reviews with very consensus they are
real-time evaluation of knowledge the
way we know it at that time and and that
is unique from Sparta my scientific
history and because this work be done so
constantly now think with the culture
that&#39;s characteristic of Scandinavia
objectivity
fair representation so forth the job has
been so well done and because the job is
well done the standard of the prizes are
uniquely high very few prices can be
contested you can always have an
argument that maybe one should have had
something and in a different field or so
buzzer so let me give you examples so
Bill Gates wrote a book the road ahead
and he didn&#39;t mention the word internet
once in that book okay and then he wrote
a revision of the book and he added the
word Internet so he missed that was
coming is there anything that you think
the committee that you were part of kind
of missed something that was right in
front of you and in kind of thinking
back oh we should have been on that and
so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re answering my
question of who did and didn&#39;t get it I
will go to another question I know
you&#39;re building a fancy Museum in Sweden
and do you think some people should be
given prizes after they they passed away
I mean it sounds like the prize was to
help jump-start people&#39;s career not a
pinnacle but kind of keep them going but
some people have passed away do you
think they should be honored
is it pasta me I&#39;m not sure the word so
there are two questions there I think
well did you miss anything okay and then
do you think you should honor dead
people so I should courageous to say no
I don&#39;t think we have missed any major
discoveries honestly there are think
about the growing science 1901 how many
scientists were there how many signs do
we have today probably tens of thousands
more amount of science we have 500
nominations for a year to work with at
the most and we distill that out to one
we can&#39;t give to everyone and and but
they do standard at the test of time the
price that we give and I could find one
or two prices that I regret that we have
given not more than that overall it&#39;s
done but by the way so you won&#39;t go on
the record telling us who you think you
regret but you will say there one or two
the their suspect that&#39;s right you heard
it here first we scooped him when you
get the name but yeah I&#39;m working on my
for spoke now and I write about the
virus and cancer and the cancer field
it&#39;s a very important field and we used
look at them Nobel Prize said oh there
are only two prizes in where we
mentioned the word cancer why not more
but we do give a lot of prize in
physiology and normal cell function is
the mirror image of the abnormal
function so we need to know the
physioline on that&#39;s under pathology
again here&#39;s some other questions so
that is one mistake if you want to have
one it&#39;s fee bigger it was a priced
about given in 1920 just said there were
no no you didn&#39;t miss anything now
saying you didn&#39;t know this was a
mistake

okay 9:27 and it&#39;s today and here the
idea that had father and background to
cancer yeah it was wrong and that the
mistake in that is that one should never
give a price to a discovery that has not
been confirmed by someone else this is
the golden rule in science you present
your data in such a way that anyone who
knows the field can repeat what you&#39;re
doing and with the repetition we build
this very very solid so later on it and
we aggregate knowledge in a building
thing the in which is exceptional in
human culture I would argue that the
growing knowledge the solid model of
growing national science knowledge is
extraordinary and that is what&#39;s
something we should be proud of and it
it does implicate our everyday in almost
yes so the total world wide web that has
transformed our our life and one could
think about giving a price pristine 56
to that yeah but it&#39;s been difficult to
find that this true discoveries in that
so we can&#39;t identify it everything so
about the people who&#39;ve passed away
should they be honored no there&#39;s no
reason for that okay great next two
questions you pick which ones you want
to answer not that many women have
gotten the prize
the first Ted in 1984 no women spoke you
know societies change I feel like that&#39;s
a big mistake I see a lot of
Scandinavians got the prize do you think
that was disproportionate or Swedes and
then I&#39;m curious what other prizes are
you tracking because they must be sort
of a filter to figure out people that
your committee should should look at and
then what do you think are the the
things you&#39;re excited about that you&#39;re
watching that maybe should get
recognized in the next few cycles so
pick whatever you want but I gave you a
lot of questions first of all we do not
check on other prizes we also check on
you we are the gold standard and we&#39;re
going through here
we go to remain the gold standard but
that put a lot of demand on you because
there&#39;s so much science of that so much
good science that yes there is
embarrassing that we don&#39;t have more
women mount the prize man the last two
years not a single woman it&#39;s not a
district or don&#39;t neglect or anything
but it it it takes time and I&#39;m the bull
jumping in the telomere price we had two
women and one man and so forth yeah so
what what what are who do you think is
who do you think is it&#39;s time for them
to get the prize next do you want to
reveal no I&#39;m a mute I&#39;m and I&#39;m I can
never say anything yeah one of the major
things like the offices you&#39;ve met with
around the world to give us a sense you
don&#39;t have to tell us
no secrets is a part of this unique game
because if no one knows what discussions
we have what&#39;s going on we cannot be
influenced and that is very very
critical but we are absolutely objective
in what we&#39;re doing to the extent that
human beings can do that okay so now we
need to find out what about the priority
of this finding how would I know about
that so in some way you have to send
salt in your corner and I have the
privilege I mean again this is my second
home country and and I have these
networks I try to sense out what&#39;s
moving by being curious by gathering new
knowledge and are you suspect of anyone
who friends you just like on Facebook or
LinkedIn or it meets you in the diner
that they have an alternative agenda so
embarrassed I don&#39;t use Facebook so you
guys I just want to wrap this up I am so
proud of Erling he&#39;s at a very
distinguished career at the Nobel Prize
and an amazing scientist and medical
leader these are two books he wrote
three years ago Nobel Prizes and nature
surprises he wrote another book a few
years before that and then this this has
just come out Nobel Prizes and Nobel
discoveries and it sounds like you&#39;re
working on a fourth book and I see by
the Delta here the next book is probably
going to be a little bigger
do you want to say anything about your
books and and why you write them except
you know science is a fantastic example
of human creativity
I am thought that science and technology
are the prime movers in our society we
need to know the source of that you need
to know if we can improve on that
so I write about individual environments
but the other thing is science is not
the predictable venture you can try to
provide an environment and all Basanti
because of this human intellect
something happens and then that is what
we want to review so you guys in
wrapping up this morning we opened up
with Nick Walker who plays George
Washington in the Hamilton play and he
filmed himself at the theater and he
went to this school and this was his
inspiration and now he&#39;s on Broadway I
think we&#39;ve all heard of the Nobel
Prizes but it&#39;s really special to meet
one of the people behind it the someone
who was in the room where it happened
kind of like Alexander Hamilton the room
where it happened and and maybe someone
in this room will be inspired to do
something extraordinary in the sciences
and now that you kind of can put a face
behind a committee member maybe
something can come from there but thanks
for demystifying the process a little
bit and Erling will be in the green room
if anyone wants to lock a hair to clone
him or or get they get an autograph and
so that was this book that&#39;s the prior
book the next one&#39;s gonna be even bigger
but you know collect all four and you&#39;ll
be on Erling special a friendless story
thank you very much
[Applause]
