we shall overcome someday
[Music]
Oh deep in my heart I do believe we
shall overcome someday I want to build
myself into a home for you want to
stretch out my arms pull you in close
held you tight let you know that there
is shelter here
I want to stack myself into brick and
mortar raise this body into refuge
change my name into safe house be strong
enough to weather the storm for you then
topple myself back into soil become a
soft place for you to fall provide
myself into a pillow so that you can
dream at night
I want to house your dreams create
myself into an altar for them hold
myself into a holy place keep safe
your sacred consecrate the bricks of me
with your hope for the future I want to
hold your story on my tongue let this
voice be your music
let this soul be your dancefloor let
these eyes be your history&#39;s mantle and
I will carve a fireplace into my ribcage
for you so that you can stay warm
through the winter and I want you to
know that when tur won&#39;t last forever
that one day only the Sun will call us
home that I will not stop building
myself into light house for you into
shelter into refuge for you I will not
stop building myself until the day that
we
can create a new world so brave it can
do nothing else but be a home for each
and every one of us but until that day
comes just know that I will never turn
you away that you will always be safe
with me
you will always be home with me deep in
my heart I do believe we shall overcome
[Music]
you
