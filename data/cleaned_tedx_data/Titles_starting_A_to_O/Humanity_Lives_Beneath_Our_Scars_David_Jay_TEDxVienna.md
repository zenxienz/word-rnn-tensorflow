today I&#39;m going to tell you a little
story unfortunately it&#39;s a story about
the worst thing that&#39;s ever happened to
me and also the best thing that&#39;s ever
happened to me
I&#39;ve actually never really told this
story to anyone not even my family or my
closest friends have ever heard what I&#39;m
going to tell you today it&#39;s very
personal and quite painful actually so
please forgive me if I stumble or stop
for a moment whenever I have to speak
about my work the unknown soldier the
scar project grief camp the Alabama
project naked ladies or any of the other
photographic series that I&#39;ve done over
these past many years whenever I speak
about it I always begin by saying I
started the scar project when a dear
young friend got breast cancer but
that&#39;s not really the truth the truth is
that something happened to me and I
thought that the first picture of the
scar project would be the last picture I
would ever take I&#39;m going to circle back
to that in a little bit I&#39;ve been a
photographer as long as I can remember
since I was a boy it&#39;s all I really know
all I&#39;ve ever done when I was young I
was so shy it was painful to speak the
pictures were my voice they could say
things I couldn&#39;t say needless to say I
am terrified of public speaking the
irony of this moment is like not lost on
me here I never went to photography
school or any school really I just
picked it up on my own and although I
had absolutely zero interest in fashion
I did have an interest in girls so I
became a fashion photographer I mean why
wouldn&#39;t you I was lucky somehow
physical beauty was a language that I
actually could speak at least be from
behind the camera and over the course of
nearly 20 years I worked all over the
world London Sydney
Paris New York Tokyo Iceland you name it
I&#39;ve taken pictures there
I worked constantly passionately
my pictures appeared in all of the
magazines that you see on the newsstand
every day I suppose by any measure I was
a very successful photographer but but
every time I was standing there every
time I was standing there on a shoot for
20 years holding the camera in my hands
looking effortlessly in charge there was
something that no one else could see I
hated it I hated being there because I
hated my pictures
I felt like an imposter that I didn&#39;t
deserve to be there I felt like I could
give the camera to anyone the cleaning
lady
the gardener anyone in the audience my
dog Fred anyone could take a better
picture than me it didn&#39;t matter how
much people liked my pictures it didn&#39;t
matter what magazines the pictures were
in it didn&#39;t matter how much they paid
me to take them nothing could convince
me that it wasn&#39;t a terrible
photographer so one day after 20 years I
just quit done finito
oh my god it was the best decision I had
ever made it was a as if some massive
weight had been lifted off my shoulders
living in my little flat on the ocean in
Sydney Australia
my life became beautiful again months
and months went by filled with yoga my
friends
endless days on the beach life was
amazing well as it turns out the
universe had other plans for me one
night after a lovely evening out with my
friends I returned home to my little
flat on the ocean I remember going to
bed feeling very
content only to wake up a few hours
later from what seemed like a bad dream
I couldn&#39;t remember what it was but I
couldn&#39;t shake the feeling either so I
thought I would get up and make myself a
cup of tea but something drew me to my
window my window on the ocean where I
had stood ten thousand times before
admiring its beauty but when I got there
my beautiful ocean was gone it had been
replaced by horror by an endless barren
burning wasteland filled with infinite
endless suffering and as I looked upon
it I too began to burn forever
the pain the suffering was indescribable
unbearable this vision only lasted for
perhaps 30 seconds and then my beautiful
moonlit ocean magically reappeared but
the pain the pain did not go away It was
as if a red-hot branding iron had been
placed against my brain yeah you can
remove this you can remove the iron but
the scar the scar remains I had been
branded I remember thinking surely I
must be dreaming I willed myself to wake
up I must wake up but it was obvious I
was awake the pain consumed me destroyed
me It was as if my very soul was on fire
and I knew in that moment that if it
didn&#39;t go away very very soon that I
would have to kill myself but it didn&#39;t
go away I laid on the bed I laid on the
floor and I tell you I do not have a
religious bone in my body
but I prayed to anyone who would listen
to take it away but it seemed no one was
listening all I could think about was
how could this be happening my poor
parents my family this would destroy
them but the pain would not go away in
fact it got worse day by day the fire
grew hotter I didn&#39;t eat
I didn&#39;t sleep and I told no one I was
embarrassed
what was I going to say I had a vision
and now I have to kill myself I began to
remove everything from my apartment
until it was nearly empty that my family
would not have to do it after I was gone
as it turns out I wasn&#39;t the only one
suffering a dear young friend appeared
in my door crying Polina had been
diagnosed with cancer and they had
removed her breast it seemed impossible
she was only 29 young healthy beautiful
she had been a model and I had
photographed her many times since she
was young now I was drawn to photograph
her again I don&#39;t know why I had no
intention perhaps yet again the
photograph could say what I could not I
took her to the studio it had been a
very long time since I had picked up my
camera I remember holding it in my hands
it felt warm like home but I knew that
it would be the last picture that I
would ever take I had reached the end of
my life I felt like I had been banished
to some mythical hell and I desperately
desperately needed an angel so I finally
told a friend what had happened
and I showed her the picture I had taken
of Polina - she looked at the picture
and said David just one more picture
just one more picture so I did one more
picture one more picture then another
and another for 15 years now that last
picture turned into a lifetime of
pictures a life a life line of pictures
hundreds of them let&#39;s look at a few
it was like stepping into them and being
them and in them I saw a truth the truth
we kept hidden from the world from
ourselves a truth of tenderness the
purity dignity compassion each frame
seemed to scrape away another layer
revealing a tender fragile soul buried
within it soothed me for a moment and
allowed them to save perhaps for the
first time who they truly were there is
an inherent beauty in humanity
a beauty that transcends the glossy
images fed to us by the media hope
despair love loss courage fear we
recognize it instantly this fragile
beauty the human condition as the years
went by we evolved the pictures evolved
there was so much trust so much love
hope we were just trying to keep our
heads above water trying to stay alive
and perhaps leave something behind the
picture a reminder that we existed in
case we didn&#39;t unfortunately everybody
didn&#39;t stay alive men died women died
many still in their twenties lifetimes
were accelerated and then cut short I
followed them through the years
documenting the changes hoping that the
pictures would transcend the confines of
war of disease of poverty of abuse and
speak a greater truth I was humbled by
their courage their prey
their trust when I first started
treating the scar project I didn&#39;t know
if anyone would want to look at the
pictures they were confronting hard to
look at dark yet in the pictures people
did not find darkness they found light
hope the images were acquired by museums
and galleries around the world the
Library of Congress acquired the
entirety of the Unknown Soldier series a
documentary was filmed of the SCAR
project and won an Emmy Award a book was
published magazine articles were written
in every language yet so easy yet as
wonderful as all of that is I am most
grateful most grateful for all of the
messages I have received from strangers
around the world thousands thousands of
them they say I&#39;m a 20 year old woman a
50 year old man a teacher a soldier a
grandmother I have cancer I was burned I
lost my legs I was born with the
disability they say I felt like a
monster I only get undressed in the dark
so that my husband can&#39;t see me I
thought no one could ever love me I&#39;d
like to read you a part of a letter I
received she explains it way better than
I ever heard her she says
I fell upon your pictures one day the
subjects were so beautiful even though
even though they looked just like me I
couldn&#39;t help but fall in love with them
a little and I thought if they are
beautiful and they look like me and I
can fall in love with them then perhaps
I too am worthy of being loved
I remember reading that when every day
was still unbearably hard when it took
every ounce of my strength just to stay
alive
I remember reading that and thinking if
I die tomorrow I&#39;ll be the happiest man
in the world
so what does it all mean what does it
all mean all of this that I&#39;ve shared
with you today I&#39;ve learned so much over
these many years so many messages I wish
I could share with you perhaps I can
leave you with this you are all very
powerful each and every one of you will
change the course of history every one
of you already has in every moment of
our lives in every little interaction
every thought every gesture no matter
how seemingly small and innocuous we
quite literally change the future create
the future the person sitting next to
you has been affected by your presence
changed by her energy forever who are
they the walking wounded are often
invisible what you say matters what you
think matters the love you hold back or
give freely matters
perhaps you will give hope to the
hopeless or thought to the thoughtless
kindness to the needy strength of the
weak
or perhaps allow a man to take just one
more picture thank you for listening to
me
[Applause]
