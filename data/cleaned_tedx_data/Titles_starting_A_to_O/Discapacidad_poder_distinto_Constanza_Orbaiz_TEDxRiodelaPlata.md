I take the train every Monday.
Then I get off, walk a few meters
and take a taxi.
I struggle a little to get into the car,
tell the address and off we go.
Then, through the little mirror

the driver smiles and says:
- Nice day, huh?
- Yes, indeed.
- Are you hanging out?
I don&#39;t know you, but I&#39;m not that lucky
at 3 p.m. on Monday.
-No, working- I tell him
as loud as I can.
- Oh, and what do you do?
- I&#39;m an educational psychologist.
I work figuring out ways
to empower others.
Poor guy, I left him speechless!

(Applause)

Anyway, on Mondays at 3 p.m.
I&#39;m on my way to work.
I work in a school
and with private patients with
disabilities.
In the school where I work,
the kids know I talk like this.
I speak weirdly and Salvador, aged 4, 
says it is because my tummy aches.

(Laughter)

But no.
In fact, I speak like this
because when I was born
I went into respiratory arrest
and into another one 12 hours later.
That lack of oxygen resulted in
a brain injury
affecting my entire motor function.
Cerebral palsy, said the doctors.
At that time, nobody knew
what I would be able to do.

But one thing was sure: whatever I did, 
would be done differently.
During primary school,
many teachers supported me.
They were able to see
all I could achieve.
Of course, there were others who thought
I would never finish
primary or secondary school.
University was out of the question.
Others preferred having me
at the back of the classroom
because it seems they didn&#39;t know
what to do with me.
They were not prepared.
Nobody is prepared.
Disability doesn&#39;t send you a whatsapp

to say: &quot;Get ready, I&#39;ll be there in 5.&quot;

(Applause)

Anyway, the best way of being prepared
is valuing diversity
as part of everyday life.
Valuing each student,
each person, for their potential.
In the school I work, there is Miguel.
Miguel - aged 5 -
finds it difficult to remain seated.
His teacher turns to me worriedly.
I observe him and suggest
he should sit on a chair,
not on the floor
so that his feet and back are supported,
he feels secure
and can pay more attention.
Just like me. When I&#39;m seated
I get less tired
and can pay more attention.
And it worked.
Because focusing on what we can do
always works.
Because based on what we can&#39;t do...

(Applause)

Nothing can be built, it falls apart.
After school, kids have football,
dance lesson or hockey.
But children with disabilities
have therapies.
Long hours, different faces,
different perspectives.
And when I was a girl,
that was reflected in my games.
Yes, my dolls had therapies.

(Laughter)

When I was playing with a friend,

she would say:
&quot;How strange, I&#39;m playing
to take them to the park
and you always take them to a place
called kinesiology?&quot;
What you live as a child
leaves a mark on you.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that
those of us who work with children
know how to treat them;
above all, they are children.
After graduating,
I founded Desde Adentro.
A project through which I spread
my approach on disability.
Because studying about a crooked leg
is not the same
as living daily with a crooked leg.
It seems the same formulas are repeated
for cases that are already different.

For example, &quot;Cerebral Palsy:
strengthen the torso,
stimulate the march,
put splints, do surgeries&quot;,
a pinch of salt and pepper.
And the person? Did they look at them?
Do you know how they live
with their difficulties?
Do you know their wishes and fears?
With kids, do they respect their playtime
so necessary for their growth?
The answers will let us know
what people need to be themselves.
And so the cabinet where we classify
the diagnoses will be too small,
because the person is always
much more than a diagnosis.

(Applause)

But it’s not easy for everyone
to work in this way.
It seems disability is a mirror
nobody wants to be reflected in.
When I was a girl,
one day a nun approached.

She looked at me and said:
&quot;I hope you get well.&quot;

(Laughter)

I looked at her and without hesitation
I said, &quot;I&#39;m already well.&quot;
Sure, because in any case,
to be cured meant learning to live
with my condition.
And to learn it’s necessary to
generate more flexible contexts,
it’s not only about building
a ramp - and not blocking it -
but creating environments where
people with disability
can be themselves without
having to look like anyone else
to receive the inclusion award.

(Applause)

What needs to be done is simple.
Make what is already difficult easier.
We are not poor little things,
nor little angels.
We are not special,
special effects are special.

(Applause)

We don’t have a handicap,
Golf players have a handicap.

(Applause)

We are people with disabilities.
People.
Thank you very much.

(Applause)
