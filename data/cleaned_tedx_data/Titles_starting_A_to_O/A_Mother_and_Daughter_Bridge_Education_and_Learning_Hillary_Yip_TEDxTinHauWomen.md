education
what does education mean to you for me
school was education but everything
changed last year when I started senior
school I was bullied instead of standing
by my side my best friend JumpShip and I
was devastated the following months were
so miserable that my parents finally
pulled me out early this year don&#39;t
worry I&#39;m fine now in fact I&#39;m having
the time of my life learning at home
with my little brother Alexis I&#39;ve
always wanted to know what made you
decide to home-school
well there still haunts me when I look
back to those days I remember vividly
that we lingered outside your school in
your worst days from 8 a.m. to 3 in the
afternoon just to be sure that we could
pick you up right away if you needed us
I really felt so powerless in my life
and by the time he pulled you all there
wasn&#39;t much decision to make really it
was the only choice we had and naturally
at the beginning all we could think of
was to put you back in another school
since you have been doing so well
academically there was just no reason
for us to think otherwise but what
happened afterwards changed my mind can
you guess what it was no I just remember
about three months after I left school
he told me that I didn&#39;t need to go for
any more school interviews and Alexis
would join me after the summer after you
left school we wanted to give you a
break so we intentionally change the way
you learned from passive to active
meaning we didn&#39;t tell you what to do
you make your own choice it was a game
changer your focus came back and since
we didn&#39;t have to care what others might
think of you you pick up subjects that
genuinely interest you like politics and
psychology I saw the train goes in your
eyes again when you went on
on and on about the subjects you learned
if I were to look for anything to
describe passion your attitude to what
learning at that time would be perfect
for it it was then that I saw your
education in a new light I began to
realize that you learn even better
outside of school really I do love that
I can dive deep into a subject and find
out everything about it you just can&#39;t
do that in school there were of course
other users with school that we just
learned to accept all the time things
like schools are never designed to suit
individual learning needs and teachers
are often too busy making sure that
everyone can catch up and the fast
learners could only wait and we took it
as it is right yeah but my true
nightmare started when I moved into
senior school they had the group
students in sets for most subjects he
included unavoidably encouraging
comparison friends started to drift
apart I felt very awkward as as
constantly being mocked and labeled as a
nerd and I found myself torn between not
wanting to be like the popular gang and
wanting to be accepted with all these
changes in school
suddenly being curious and passionate
about learning just wasn&#39;t cool anymore
the feeling of not fitting in was so
overwhelming that my confidence faded
away in school and I guess that&#39;s why I
succumb to the bullies you know having
be viewed or experienced with a total of
five schools in the past 12 years I have
concluded that a dream school just
doesn&#39;t exist every single school has
its own issues and at the end of the day
the responsibility is always on the
parents so I was able to keep a level
head to accept alternatives and giving a
positive learning experience outside of
school homeschooling became more and
more appealing to me but it was due to
another reason a positive one this time
that really gave us the
much need a boost of confidence to
commit you homeschooling Hillary can job
provide a few highlights of the
experience in the business world sure
two years ago when I was 10 I took part
in a kids entrepreneurship program for
fun there I came up with the idea for
minor - which aims to connect kids
around the world from meaningful
exchanges and for us to learn from each
other two years on it became a
full-fledged business through working on
my startup I noticed a real-world is a
sharp contrast to the school environment
rather than being confined and
restricted the real working environment
has no boundaries
instead of separating people by age
you&#39;ll find people of all ages working
together in the past few months I&#39;ve had
the opportunity to work with a 94 year
old entrepreneur as you prepare to speak
in event together I&#39;ve learned so much
from him like when he decided to sell
magazines to meet more people instead of
taking a steady job in HSBC I learned
about taking risks
unlike school I was welcomed with open
arms by the business world from my
mentors who selflessly taught me in
their own time I learned about what
happens after school life I absolutely
loved energetic and vibrant atmosphere
and I can&#39;t wait to dive right into it I
assented that I may be different for my
peers in school but I will find
like-minded people later on in life and
until then I just have to believe in
myself the other thing I got from this
experience is don&#39;t be afraid to do
things differently I&#39;ve seen and done so
much through minor - that I could never
have encountered if I decided to carry
on with my daily life not try new things
this experience has definitely shown us
what you are capable of and apart from
helping you review your confidence I&#39;ve
also gained some insight from it first
learning by doing is by far the best
weight of education you have soft-like
sponge in a real-life environment you
literally transformed from little girl
to an unstoppable person with the
confidence to talk business with anyone
and since your main business people take
you seriously and he blew my mind
funny as it may seem I actually feel
more like myself in the business world
than when I was in school I saw looking
at your interaction with others it&#39;s
like we were given a chance to peek into
your future reassuring us that you do
perfectly okay despite the minor setback
in school and we shouldn&#39;t be worrying
about your future at all what we should
do instead is to focus on doing the
right thing for you and what feels right
learn on your own terms
free from any limitations and keep
connecting to the real world seem like
it so we get it our inner strength
defied all the pressure and objections
from the family and took the leap of
faith to start homeschooling
and here we are how do you feel about
homeschooling so far I love it I love
that I have the freedom to choose what I
want to learn and manage my own time
although it can be tough sometimes I&#39;d
rather feel challenged and bored and
frankly for me it&#39;s a liberating
experience I see so much potential in
the development outside of the school
setting maybe you can share a thing or
two over typical homes today okay we are
still pursuing academic studies actually
even more intensely than we did in
school now that we don&#39;t need to travel
back and forth we start right after
breakfast from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. we
concentrate and learn more than we would
on any school day for the rest of the
time we have sports interest classes or
we can work on projects of our own
choice for example alexis has two types
of football classes well I have debate I
also love that I can spend more time on
minor minors without asking for
permission
sometimes the home screen community
would organize special
first to go on together such as the one
we recently had at a bakery where the
baker spent two hours showing us all the
ingredients walking us through the
process and the signs behind it it&#39;s
mind boggling what about your social
life this is the single most asked
questions since we homeschool you can
you address this concern contrary to
what people think we actually have a
social life we have joint activities
with other homeschooling kids we have
regular group classes where we
collaborate and form teams with other
kids
such as in Girl Guides similar to what
you adults have in the real world when
you make an effort to see your friends
outside of work we arrange playdates and
sleepovers with friends there you go but
the main point about a host experience
though it&#39;s not just about homeschooling
it&#39;s the revelation that school is not
equal to education we the parents cannot
Blindy trust a system we cannot put our
kids education on autopilot instead we
must take charge of it it is even more
important for us to discuss about this
now as we are now facing an imminent
revolution in the job market many jobs
professional ones included will be
replaced by artificial intelligence and
smart machines and believe it or not it
is already happening we can&#39;t ask you to
follow in our footsteps anymore
as our previous success formula is
clearly not going to work for your
generation it is time for us parents to
take an active role to help their kids
define and design the education to give
them room to explore and have the time
to think ahead otherwise they were under
paralyzed and not able to cope in the
future you know I get agitated when all
kids are being asked the same question
what do you want to be when you grow up
how are we supposed to know
so we echo our parents dr. Boyer thank
her we just don&#39;t know the options as we
don&#39;t have the time or opportunity to
think that far ahead you know while you
alt are having your happy hours and
chilling out we self extra lessons
studying and homework to do I once had a
classmate who told the whole class that
she never had dinner at home dude your
endless lessons she just ate in the MTR
what we need is time and space we don&#39;t
need those back-to-back lessons and
activities like your back-to-back
meetings I totally agree with you but
believe me the school you&#39;ve been to
already those with the least homework
and exams do you have no idea what other
kids in Hong Kong are facing on a
day-to-day basis oh yes
remember the documentary we watched on
the local education system I was up
smacked when we were watching a boys
homework routine after he finished his
lessons and activities it was already
pretty late but a poor kids saw an 8 to
10 pieces of homework to get through so
his mum set up a 15 minute timer for
each piece about half way through this
routine the kid needed to poop and guess
the mums reaction no she told him that
he could only go in his break 30 minutes
later this absolutely shocked me
unfortunately I have to say this is the
norm in Hong Kong but anyway at least we
have your education your own hands right
and it is now down to us to make the
best out of it so tell me what do you
want for your own education to me
education is all about learning to
prepare for the future education should
be focused on us
not the ideal school or the grades
education should be tailored to our
needs how we learn our pace
and our strengths and most importantly I
believe that education should be all
about giving us the time to have a
childhood to learn from and explore
perfect you know your dad and I have
come up with three guiding principles
for your education and having listened
to what you&#39;ve just said I believe they
could live up to your expectations do
you want to hear what they are
definitely
first we will personalize your academic
studies to the best of your ability
preference and pace will be strategic
and specific to reach your goal and no
time will be wasted second we will allow
to explore your interests and to develop
expertise early this will give you extra
years in advance to figure out an
experiment what you are interested in
what you will be good at and what you
will enjoy to do and this is how you
prepare for the future
the worst thing we can have is you
graduated from University and not
knowing what you want to do third we
will help you develop the personal
qualities that are key to success in
life for me they are emotional control
patience and having the right attitudes
and core values within you these are the
qualities they&#39;re going to take you a
long way so what do you think sounds
great we&#39;ll have to see how it plays out
I&#39;m convinced that if we are doing this
right you and Alexis will have a future
that Mommy can only dream of
[Applause]
