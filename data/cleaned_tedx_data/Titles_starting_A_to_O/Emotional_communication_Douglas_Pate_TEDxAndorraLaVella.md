good morning just change chip to English
let&#39;s start with a reflection we&#39;ve seen
that we&#39;ve seen that on the the social
medias we&#39;ve seen it on Facebook and we
see it a lot not true we are responsible
we are responsible for what the other
person hears we&#39;re a lawyer
we&#39;re trying to explain a contract we&#39;re
salesman we&#39;re we&#39;re just trying to
communicate to the other person we must
understand what the other person
understands it is our responsibility
when people ask me what I do I sometimes
explain I teach people how to speak
their own language I give them ideas
about how to speak their own language at
school we might learn English we might
learn French we might learn grammar
we&#39;ll study literature but who actually
tells us how to structure our own
language to better communicate because
we have words words are building blocks
were the pillars words of what we use
words of what you&#39;re hearing today words
of a highway may be the super net the
hyper net that allows us to communicate
our emotions our feelings our thoughts
to everyone so sometimes we ask
ourselves the question how do we learn
why do we learn a word how do we use why
do we use a word and maybe we can look
to change modify or fine-tune the words
we use to better communicate emotional
communication is the understanding of
the emotion within the word were using
we perceive it and how that emotion is
received by the other person whether
it&#39;s written spoken sung whether it is
in an advert a blog or a webpage if we
communicate emotionally aware of what
we&#39;re saying we communicate more
efficiently we are emotional beings I&#39;m
nervous you guys are listening there&#39;s
emotion we grow through emotion we react
through emotion we buy through emotion
we change country through emotion we are
emotional beings and right from then we
receive sounds these sounds are words
these sounds have nothing whatsoever to
do with what they&#39;re saying it is for
example the duo syllable Mountain
Mountain has absolutely nothing
whatsoever to do with mountains in the
same way that the Catalan Montaigne has
absolutely nothing to do the sound with
the words we begin to hear these words
that coming at us they&#39;re coming at us
and slowly 9 months 15 months 18 months
we begin to use sounds back to help us
survive something might simply be mama
something might simply be hot water
thirsty we use them to get in to get on
with how we&#39;re trying to live our lives
so that as we get older we&#39;re able to
communicate better as we get older as we
get older we learn to communicate and
transmit with these sounds to with other
people now when words enter they enter
here and they enter here the enter what
we call an emotional dictionary when we
hear a sound
or when we give a sound out the word
that word we look for in our mind before
we transmit it now these words will vary
in our lives for example a good example
is the word home Oh God oh yeah the word
home varies through our lives and when
we&#39;re children you hear the word home
you use the word home you feel at home
when you leave home home is different
home might be a student apartment home
might be another country if we live in
the sub Sahara desert home is a
different feeling a different idea now
that because when we go through life we
feel a change in the word and the
meaning of the word that&#39;s what we tend
to call our micro perception of the word
there is something called a macro
perception and that is when society
changes the meaning of the word for us
let me use an example we have
smartphones we&#39;re all now at 4G before
it was 3G because we live post 2010 now
if we were around in America or we were
following the space program in the 60s
and the 70s and we heard 3G or 4G we
would think three times gravitational
pull I don&#39;t know how many of you here
were around in the 60s and the 70s I
certainly remember he pulled a 10g okay
so society the macro change of the
meaning of the word changes the way we
perceive it and that&#39;s exactly what
happens we have a perception of a word a
meaning and someone else has a
perception is it the same so when we
speak when we talk when we hear are we
hearing what is spoken so let&#39;s take a
look at the actual act of communication
setting aside the intent there are four
steps and what happens with the word or
the sound the word is spoken it creates
this image the mind the emotional
dictionary looks for some form of
reference to tell us what the word means
with that image we have an emotion is
our emotion the same as the other
person&#39;s emotion there&#39;s another thing
I&#39;d like to take an extra minute just to
explain here because emotion about the
word can also be emotional memory when
we actually receive it or when we
actually give it for example a teacher a
teacher just before lunch with this
class especially 14 15 16 year-olds just
before lunch they&#39;re all hungry
they&#39;re looking at the clock there no
not emotionally connected fully to what
the teacher is saying we&#39;ve just come
back from having coffee we&#39;ve had a
break we&#39;ve relaxed we&#39;re emotionally
perhaps more perceptive and receptive to
what I&#39;m saying now if you&#39;re giving a
session as a coach in a company and
you&#39;ve got smokers in front of you at
about an hour and 45 minutes you&#39;ve
basically lost them okay so the emotion
of the word and the emotion of
transmission or reception modify
slightly the way we might perceive what
it means now that provokes a consequence
if we think about work we think about
lawyers trying to explain something we
think about doctors trying to explain
something if the word that enters is we
have no reference we get with a doctor
worried what does that mean okay so we
go right back to the perception have we
transmitted with our words the
perception the meaning the consequence
that we want and here we get to the next
point
are we really listening are we listening
to the sound that comes at us do we
understand what the other person means
because well
is an active experience you must
concentrate to listen approximately 250
words can be spoken per minute someone
some languages go faster some languages
go smaller slower so 250 words a minute
is what we can speak at but we can
listen at 500 and by listening at 500 we
have a gap between what comes in and
what we&#39;re able to absorb so we have got
this noise in our head silence you can
be silent when you&#39;re listening now how
much extra is going up there how much
you&#39;re thinking about the fact that
you&#39;re just about to make a payment on
your mortgage or your car&#39;s broken and
you can&#39;t get to where you want it to
this evening the silence is not just not
speaking silence is eliminating that
movie that&#39;s going on in your brain by
eliminating it you receive more freely
the words that come to you you learn
when you&#39;re silent and he will also say
silence sometimes is the best answer and
what I&#39;d like to do is I&#39;d like to give
three hot tips about what can be done
now immediately to improve the way you
can communicate with others transmitting
or receiving the first we can do is
eliminate the negative now words can be
negative words like crisis rape words
that are bad but we can also have a
negative energy as we&#39;re trying to
deliver the message what we need to try
and do is look towards structuring
things in a positive way now strangely
enough
there is something I hear a lot in this
areas problema no problem what we&#39;ve
done is we&#39;ve used a negative in what
we&#39;re trying to say is positive there&#39;s
another thing we hear a lot never give
up
how long is never and what about giving
up giving up in itself is negative
that&#39;s the most negative word you can
think of no in itself is a stop it&#39;s a
block
it&#39;s a prevention when someone says what
do you think of that no I don&#39;t like it
you&#39;ve now got to negotiate around the
null so if we could try and look to
eliminate no when we receive information
we keep the flow of the conversation the
flow of the interchange of information
moving let&#39;s bring in the positive
positives are of course yes positives
are when for example someone is
presenting a proposal to you to repair
your house or a proposal to repair your
car or you are a boss with someone who&#39;s
bringing in some information about the
project you&#39;re working on when the
person gives you the information don&#39;t
say no I don&#39;t like that no that&#39;s not
right it&#39;s hmm how did you get to that
tell me why that happened okay a very
very positive thing that people like
because positive conversation motivates
stimulates and continues the dialogue is
simply I like that tell me how you got
that we also say in English control the
imprecise that&#39;s avoid the relative now
what is the relative what is the
imprecise relative is everything related
to us and it is typically adjectives
relative or imprecise
are basically adjectives for example I
have long hair but she has short hair I
put the paperwork into the government
and they said it&#39;ll be quick when do I
get the paperwork back it&#39;s quick but
what is quick to me what is quick to her
one way we can say your products will
arrive really quickly you&#39;ll get them on
Friday before midday because we&#39;re
controlling the imprecise we define the
imprecise we say products will arrive on
Friday I want my hair short so with
those three tips eliminating the
negative by talking through the positive
and especially by defining that which is
relative to you or relatives as someone
else were able to better transmit the
message we want to convey now here is a
word that when I showed this I&#39;ll sent
this presentation to my mother she saw
this slide and she said well I knew
you&#39;d have something like that your
passion about this word because but is
classified as an e gaiter and an
eliminator
what does it do it negates everything
just said and it eliminates your real
desire to hear everything afterwards how
do we learn but remember the face of the
youngster but mom I&#39;m watching TV but
mom I said I was going to go out with
Dave I really agree with everything
you&#39;ve said but but comes at you and you
think he hasn&#39;t been listening he&#39;s not
interested it also tends to negate
what&#39;s about to be said I try never to
say but is it possible I actually agree
so if we&#39;re able to understand the
emotion within the words that we use
whether they&#39;re nouns substantives
whether they&#39;re adjectives or verbs and
we can perceive and understand what the
other understands we will communicate
emotionally and communicate more
efficiently thank you very much
you
