everyone&#39;s heard the whole cliche never
take life for granted but as humans we
become complacent and we often take
chapters of our life for granted even
the ones that we haven&#39;t been able to
reach it and on September 30 of 2006
that all changed for me that was the day
that I lost my mother my three brothers
and my sister they were taken away
because of two words domestic violence
they were murdered by my mother&#39;s
husband and those chapters that we take
for granted such as me being able to see
my brother graduate
me being able to see my other brother
play football maybe even Oh teach my
other brother how to drive we&#39;ve been
even able to see my sister go to prom my
mom even being able to see me getting
married are being able to even meet my
son those are chapters of my life that
were basically a race from my book and
so after that when you when I lost my
immediate family I lost my identity and
who I was I had to rediscover who I was
so I had to find out who who was I Who
am I gonna be where am I going why did
this happen to me and it took me on a
journey where I had internal warfare
going on within me because that was the
first time in my life that I experienced
what hate really felt like and I
understood why we&#39;re not supposed to
hate because it can consume you and so
on that journey I always asked why why
did this happen to me
and one day I woke up and I went to
church and the sermon that day was about
asking for guidance and asking the right
questions and so I left there and I knew
that I needed to ask something different
and so I started asking for guidance and
three months later I hosted an event in
honor of my mom and my four siblings to
bring awareness to domestic violence and
on that day with three weeks of planning
we had over 500 people show up that day
and at the end of the event we saved six
victims and ironically to me it was like
saving my family and saving myself but
at the end of the event even though it
was a great event and we saved people it
still felt like something was missing it
felt like something still just wasn&#39;t
right something still wasn&#39;t there and
there was more to this story was more
things that I needed to accomplish and
so senator invited me to a high school
to speak to some kids in an auditorium
and I had two sessions with 600 kids and
I spoke to the kids about dating and
domestic violence spoke to them about
the signs and told them about my story
and afterwards I had a line of kids that
wanted to talk to me about my story tell
me about their personal stories at home
and also tell me about the personal
dating issues that they have themselves
and the last thing that someone said to
me was I wish that someone would come in
and talk to us about dating violence in
the science and that&#39;s when it&#39;s like I
had an epiphany and everything became
clear and I knew what my mission was and
I knew what I was supposed to do and I
knew that education was the key to shake
up the culture of domestic violence and
there&#39;s three points
in that education that we have to hit on
the first thing is that instead of
eliminating gender roles we have to
teach and establish healthy ones for our
young men and our young women for our
young men they grow up they play with
toys such as action figures to play with
toy guns they play with trucks they play
with all these aggressive components and
that&#39;s why they go into certain job
fields that&#39;s why you have a majority of
men such as firefighters military police
and mechanics they go into those job
fields because those are the things that
they play with it when they were young
and they see those things on TV so
that&#39;s how they get their identity when
it comes to women when they&#39;re young
they usually play with doll babies to
play with easy big ovens they play with
you know girl stuff as they say and you
know that&#39;s why they become the
nurturing type and they become nurses
they become teachers and they follow
those kind of job fields because that&#39;s
what they&#39;re kind of brought up to do
but as a man it doesn&#39;t mean that you
can&#39;t have a nurturing side when I was
14 my mom taught me how to do my
sister&#39;s here not because I was less of
a man
but because she said that in case
anything ever happened to your wife if
you have a daughter I want you to be
able to take care of your daughter these
are not boys skills these are not girls
skills these are life skills and so I
know how to do here but does that fit
but does that make me less of a man and
it does not
I don&#39;t do here for a living but if I
had a daughter I know that I would be
able to provide and take care of her and
so sometimes as men we put ourselves
inside these boxes and we say this is
what it means to be a man and that can
create a lot of pressure and without the
proper guidance men become very
aggressive and that&#39;s our culture
culture is aggression we feel like women
should be submissive to us but there&#39;s a
lot more that goes off of relationships
that split it 50/50 because behind every
strong man there&#39;s a woman support in
that drive and making that drive happen
and so the next thing is that for ages
women have always been at the forefront
of domestic violence they have been the
voices they&#39;ve been screaming their
lungs out about domestic violence and we
as men and then they accept their role
and they take action as victims of
domestic violence but we as men we never
joined the conversation we never speak
about domestic violence
we never accept our role we never even
admit that we have a part to play in it
and as men we have to start accepting
that role and take a responsibility for
the actions that we contribute to women
losing their lives
and as men we we have two different
roles that we have to accept we have to
accept my role as abusers and we also
have to set up our role as victims
because men are also victims of domestic
violence but that box that I talked
about we don&#39;t break outside of that box
to go tell our best friend or a
co-worker hey my wife abused me last
night our things are getting crazy
because we&#39;re still stuck inside that
box and anything outside of that box is
what we don&#39;t consider to be a man and
so the third and the most important part
to me is age-appropriate proactive
education so over this summer we taught
over 600 kids ages 5 through 12
about bullying and power and control
which are the same behaviors that
transition into dating and domestic
violence so we feel like if we begin a
culture this low and tell them this is
what it means to establish friendship in
a healthy relationship and these are the
unhealthy things because 85% of kids who
experience domestic violence in the home
they either become the abuser or they
become abuse it&#39;s learned behavior
so we have to take action to teach them
what a healthy relationship looks like
give them that example because they may
not always get that opportunity at home
and so when we go into high schools this
year we will surpass 2500 kids that
we&#39;re teaching about dating and domestic
violence
and the impact that is having on kids is
just incredible a student came to me and
told me that after our first session
that she went to her boyfriend and she
told him some of the things that we were
experiencing in our relationship is
considered dating violence and power and
control and she said if these things do
not change we can&#39;t date any longer and
and to me that speaks to the power of
saving of life we don&#39;t always have to
be reactive to save life there&#39;s a lot
of organizations out there that are
reactive to domestic violence and I
realized that my mission is to be
proactive and prevent it from happening
and to save lives by being proactive and
so my challenge to you today especially
the men in the room is to look yourself
in the mirror
what kind of example do you ought to be
for your sons
40 youth do you want to be a father that
had those conflict by talking calmly do
you want to be the father that handles
conflict by yelling and cursing do you
want to be the father that punts punches
hold with sheetrock&#39;s or do you want to
be the father that punches someone in
the mouth when you&#39;re upset because your
kids are watching and the examples that
you said today are the same way that
they&#39;re gonna handle conflict as adults
so be the great example and be a part of
that change because you don&#39;t want to
wait until it&#39;s your family you don&#39;t
want to wait until as your mother your
sister your daughter your son to decide
that it&#39;s enough because by then it&#39;s
too late in those chapters that you look
forward to reading the chapters that I
will never get to read in life are gone
thank you
