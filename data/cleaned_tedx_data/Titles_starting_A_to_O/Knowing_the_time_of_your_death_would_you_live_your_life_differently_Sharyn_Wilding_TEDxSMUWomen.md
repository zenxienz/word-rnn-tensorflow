the question that I have been posing to
everybody that I meet is if you knew the
exact day of your death how would you
change the blueprint of your life for
most of us in our lives we walk along
the path and we never think about a
question like this believe me I have I
wouldn&#39;t have done this either until

August the 4th 2016 at 4:23 p.m. my
beautiful young son and my only child
died
for most of my life I&#39;ve been a very
ordinary person wasn&#39;t a really deep
thinker I came from England and I was
raised in a an environment of probably
not a lot of positivity my mom raised
nine children by herself and I was the
eldest of the third I was never seen for
most of my life
I was always probably invisible and for
most of my life I would say I was on two
paths one path was this path of
shuffling emotionally through life I
didn&#39;t know who I was
the other path was on the path of
wanting more materialistically now one
of the things raised it being raised in
poverty and being raised on welfare you
were told at a very young age that
you&#39;re not enough not by someone
verbally telling you that you&#39;re not
enough but you the way you are
we&#39;re the way you are treated always
saying you go over there in that line if
you&#39;re going to go ahead and get free
lunches free uniforms and the one thing
in my mind I always said that when I get
older I&#39;m going to go ahead and I&#39;m
going to make money so I can pass it on
to my family because I always thought
the bigger the house the bigger the car
that you had were arrived so I came to
America over I think it&#39;s 30 years ago I
met my husband in UK and we moved over
to Africa we got married in Africa and
we came over here and because I always
wanted to go ahead and follow the path
of
materialistic things I just I decided
with my husband we were going to go
ahead and open a business to businesses
were available at that time
one business was the ice cream store can
you imagine the other business was a
childcare and I&#39;ll have to tell you at
the time I did not have any children I
thought I wasn&#39;t gonna have any children
it&#39;d been married almost 17 years
without having a child so I thought that
would be perfect but I have to tell you
children I love them I have been taking
care of almost I think it&#39;s over 15,000
children most of my life and it&#39;s been
the biggest privilege that anyone could
give me and I&#39;m honored every day when a
mother or a father brings their children
into my school children connect with you
whether you like it or not this one
little girl the other day well probably
a couple of months ago they look at you
for everything they connect with you
just by when you walk in the room this
one little girl came up to me four years
old and said Miss Sharon can I ask you a
question I said sure she said are you
poor and I said why would you say that
should because you wear that same dress
over and over again
and I said to her no honey I&#39;m not poor
but I&#39;m just lazy because I don&#39;t get my
clothes out the night before
anyway fast-forwarding fast-forwarding -
why the question if you knew the exact
day of your your your death how would
you change the blueprint of your life in
August of 2004 - - excuse me 2016 when
my son died I just come I just come back
from a two-week event and I had been
told or I should say I&#39;d been told
people were saying that you know you&#39;re
gonna find your tribe to get your vibe
and I was at that age thinking well
maybe I should so I went rolling two
programs one was called the enlightened
warrior camp the other camp was the
ultimate leadership the enlightened
warrior camp was climbing up 27 foot
trees jumping off platforms walking
across hot coals 32 foot hot coals and
the whole time I&#39;m there I&#39;m thinking to
myself hmm where&#39;s my vibe here I I mean
I&#39;m standing in line ready to go ahead
and walk the hot coals and I&#39;m thinking
if the person comes and pours those hot
coals on there when I&#39;m ready to get up
I&#39;m gonna get really really upset so
there I was the hot coals came on and
I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ve got to say something
really amazing when I walk across there
so I&#39;m standing there and I&#39;m thinking
okay everybody&#39;s saying all these you
know wonderful things about how they&#39;re
gonna change their life and as I&#39;m
running across I&#39;m going please please
as my feet are burning I want to stop
procrastination I want to have the
tiniest bedroom in in Texas and then I
went like this came back and and then
the next camp a week later was about the
ultimate leadership and one of the
things that I had to do was a
paintballing camp and you had to capture
the flag it was to do with leadership
anyway I was right there
and I&#39;m going as as I&#39;m going down here
and I&#39;m going oh my god it&#39;s hurting me
anyway eventually I captured the flag
eventually I went ahead and just said to
my colleagues as because when I was the
leader I said I don&#39;t care two hoots
who&#39;s gonna go ahead and be the leader
because I&#39;m gonna go ahead and stand
behind that little rock because I&#39;m
getting bruised everywhere so that night
we all got together and we all decided
to talk about our experience I got up
there and I said that I thought it was
the most stupidest thing I don&#39;t care if
I&#39;m ever gonna be a leader so and and I
remember at that point thinking to
myself you know what I&#39;ve got a lot to
learn about leadership however that
night the next day we were closing this
closing ceremony there was an event and
it was a song by Rod Stewart which was
amazing
Rod Stewart&#39;s song called the first time
it&#39;s been said there&#39;s no such thing as
random events in your life did what
little did I know that that random event
would be pivotal in my life in changing
my life because as we&#39;re walking around
the room and just this song and you&#39;re
looking at another human being you&#39;re
looking at them in their eyes and
there&#39;s a line in that song which says
for the first time as I look at you it&#39;s
the first time I&#39;ve seen you forever
fast-forwarding - when I got back home
on the Saturday on the Sunday my son had
a fever he was taken into the hospital
with sepsis and four days later he died
and I want to tell you something my
husband and I were I&#39;d never experienced
that we&#39;ve never been in hospitals and
when the doctor comes in and said
there&#39;s nothing else we can do and you
have to make that decision to take him
off his breathing machine we are asking
each other what should we do after his
death the doctor came in and said to us
you may have some time and I want to
tell you for the very first time in my
life as I was watching my son looking at
this six-foot 28-year old young man I
realized I&#39;d never connected to him in
the way I connected as he was dying or
had he died he had his gifts and his
gift that he gave to me was the gift of
connection and for the first time in my
life I connected with in my son&#39;s death
at that time it&#39;s something you cannot
describe I remember standing in his
hospital room and I&#39;m thinking to myself
I can either leave this room and fall
into the abyss or I can leave this room
and continue his legacy what was his
legacy this is another thing I did not
have that I didn&#39;t realize when you are
on that path of wanting more and because
that&#39;s the way I felt life should be and
I&#39;ve been taking care of everybody
else&#39;s children I never took the time to
really look at my son and I never took
the time to tell him that my son was
enough just to where he was one of the
things about death is that you have to
go through all their personal belongings
and I never realized that my son was had
such deep feelings about another human
being
he was always told but I never would
always used to tell me that he was a
very kind young man and I would say
along my life there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve
been I&#39;ve always tried to be kind to
another human being I was going through
his journals and on his one of his
journals it&#39;s he I found it said the
first words were I&#39;m 16 years old and
I&#39;m sitting here in front of the
computer at 3 a.m. 3 a.m. in the morning
and I&#39;m wondering why is it
that some people in this world have so
much and other people don&#39;t
I wonder why is it that the person who
is an homeless person on the street is
that we walk right past them we don&#39;t
look at them we don&#39;t connect to them
however if a person drives up in their
brand-new spanking Ferrari everybody
stops everybody runs over and say and
and we&#39;ll go ahead and talk about how
magnificent this Ferrari is and at that
point in time my son was already
thinking about the meaning of life and
it just brought me to tears and I again
just so many thoughts about I didn&#39;t
know what my son&#39;s goals and aspirations
were another thing as I was going
through his paperwork I I found his
goals his one-year goal his five-year
goal his 10-year goal one of the things
going back to his journal the last words
he said how are we at the end of your
life he said who is going to remember
you who&#39;s gonna be at your bedside
because at the end of the day is
somebody gonna go ahead and say Blake
hunter wildin beloved owner of a Ferrari
or is it gonna be Blake Hunter welding
the beloved the beloved son of zone so
so at that point I went my god my
beautiful son gave me the gift of
connection and I will tell you right now
I connect with everyone one of the
things that I have realized in life is
that for everybody who&#39;s sitting here
you don&#39;t have to go through a personal
tragedy in your life to go ahead and
change the blueprint of your life you
need to kind of look with inside you and
you need to start thinking about that
question
my life right now is about connecting to
others a couple of months after my son
had died I went into Walmart and as I
was standing in the checkout counter I
saw this magnificent young lady who was
standing there smiling interacting with
everyone and as I came up to the the
checkout I said to her may I say
something to you she said of course I
said you have a magnificent smile I said
but I cannot I&#39;m overcome with how much
you are connecting to everybody that
comes in here and she said for most
people they may think being a cashier at
Walmart day in and day out
means nothing she&#39;s bought what I think
of is that I want to have everybody to
have an experience I want someone to
feel good so when they come in to
Walmart and I&#39;m talking to them I want
them to go out to that car and I want
them to remember me the other experience
I had when I was on another train just
recently in London and there was a lady
it was in rush hour traffic and she was
reading her book and as she was she was
reading her book I decided to ask her a
question and I said Oh what is the name
of your book and she told me and as we
started talking about different things
and the journey is about 45 minutes she
said to me can I say something to you
and I said of course she does you know
that I&#39;ve been doing this journey for
three years and no one ever talks to you
you have your head down so I said well
today is different and she thanked me
so that gift of connection that gift of
self connection the gift of my son&#39;s
life has also given me the the urgency
about living for all intense purposes my
son who was 28 years old thought he had
his whole life ahead of him you&#39;re
looking at me and I&#39;m approaching I&#39;m
closer to 70 than I am to 60 so now my
life is all about can
neck ting and being connected to another
human being one of the things I decided
after my son died that I was going to
start this foundation the beautiful
human way the beautiful human way is
about connecting what&#39;s going on on the
inside and manifesting it on the outside
and I want to tell each and every one of
you each and every one of you were here
today you probably have any you may have
done but a lot of you probably haven&#39;t
even looked at the person next to you
looked at the person behind you and
you&#39;ve not you know we don&#39;t do that and
we&#39;re not connecting and the reason why
I decided to come and do this TED talk
like is because I felt like time is now
it&#39;s ready - I&#39;m ready to pump up my
volume in my life in every aspect and I
know that as a result of this I can make
a difference to another human being so I
may be an ordinary person with an
extraordinary mission to change the
world one person at a time
one smile at a time one connection at a
time because believe me out there there
are a lot of people or on that path of
collecting things and wanting bigger and
better but at the end of the day as my
mother used to say Sharon please make
sure that people feel better from being
around you not worse
so for each and every one of you here
today I really would like even if it&#39;s
just one person to take the time and sit
down and really ask yourself if I knew
the exact day of my death how would I
change the blueprint of my life I will
tell you I&#39;m asking everybody I was at
the airport recently it came in last
night my other second favorite person
died and
had to go to England and I and and I
came in last night and I&#39;m gonna tell
you all so openly and honestly a lot of
the answers are pretty lame and I&#39;m
going to say that not in and I&#39;m not in
a judgmental manner but what I would say
is they would say well I don&#39;t know
so I said they said what do you think
and I said well maybe we need to start
connecting to our children maybe we need
to start connecting to all the people in
your life that you haven&#39;t connected to
one of the things I think is just
picking up the phone and asking you your
friends being attentive the other gift
that my son gave me was the gift of
being able to like I said pump up the
volume in my life each and every one of
us I believe needs a cheerleader or we
need those balcony people and my biggest
cheerleader was my son my son would
always say at the end of the day when I
came in how are you mom always used to
call me hot cuz he said you know and
also called me vain because he said I
was always asking how how I looked you
know and one of the things about him but
I that I really love though is when I
when I asked him what he thought about
the things I was doing he always said
mom you can do anything and I feel like
I now said action what I said to him at
the time as well I said Blake you know
I&#39;m thinking about writing a book and he
goes well mom you should do that I never
thought about it you say writing a book
again whom I am just an ordinary person
I take care of children which is an
extraordinary gift but I said I&#39;m you
know and then after my son&#39;s death and
after I realize there was beautiful
gifts that he had that died with him I
realize I&#39;m right this book I&#39;m writing
is called the beautiful human way living
a regret free life as a
parent because it all starts I believe
with our children and that I think those
gifts those gifts of being courageous
those gifts my very first TED talk that
I&#39;d ever listened to was the one that
was written that was with brené Brown
who you all know it daring greatly and
one of the things she said is courage
start with showing up and letting
ourselves be seen so I&#39;m seeing here
today I have courage and I will continue
bringing this courage down from my son
and even though I miss my beautiful
young man every single day I miss who he
was but you know what I have decided
that there are so many more people who
are alive today who have gifts they
don&#39;t even know about and so in closing
I want to say this privilege of me being
here today I thank you and I thank you
for listening to me and I just want to
say it&#39;s been magnificent thank you as
are you
[Applause]
