in this modern society we still like to
think of minority groups as oppressed as
pain we still consider minorities often
commonly and subconsciously they are so
considered to be objects victims of hate
crimes and not real enough to the point
where we see them as real as complex as
beautiful as imaginative which evokes
the suggestion that we think that these
people can&#39;t possibly be the leaders of
their own societal change that we think
that they aren&#39;t human enough to be
properly represented in all forms of
Education which dictates the cultural
world outside of it think about it who
can you name who is a female scientist
other than Marie Curie who can you name
that is an Asian politician and the u.s.
art is the uncensored art is the only
place where we see true representation
where names like Frida Frida Kahlo and
Vincent van Gogh reign with parity
autistic redheaded black female deaf gay
individuals are depicted as more than
just a single label of their identity
they are judged on their brains on their
emotions on their talent
it wouldn&#39;t be my history teacher who
first taught me of any POC culture
outside of slavery outside of Japanese
internment camps outside of the world
wars it would be miss Conte my art
teacher who first mentioned the Pharaohs
and their pyramids who first mentioned
the Huns and the revolutions in weaponry
who first mentioned guan stewart Belford
junior in space Bessie Coleman in her
plane and Senator mazie Hirono in her
seat later on the first to mention
accomplishments not abuse stories she
would also be the one who took me to the
Blanton&#39;s to see the works of a ella on
it suey
the man who reminds us that we are all
connected through handmade links and
that broken doesn&#39;t directly translate
to ugly or wasteful
art is what single-handedly combat my
instinct to follow the institutionalized
isms and as I drifted away from it later
on I began to realize how racism
ethnocentrism and so on are so heavily
normalized in American society how when
I used to play iSpy it was probably
easier to spy say sexism than something
the color blue our textbooks like to
think that people who are not in the
majority have not accomplished anything
or they like to forget certain pieces of
stories such as how Imperial Britain led
to the downfall of Africa or how Hitler
forcibly sterilized African Germans or
how he viewed Muslims much the same way
that he viewed Jews why because our
media our art as scanned when it is put
into textbooks into curriculum into our
minds to create which man de negocio DG
referred to as a one-sided story in her
own said talk ignorant is a problem that
must be solved and one powerful way to
do that is through art everyone here
probably thinks that English is the next
lingua franca or that it currently is
but I argue art is the only true
universal language it&#39;s the only
language that can communicate to those
who are deaf mute blinds to all of those
who are alienated this misogynistic
heteronormative whitewashed able-bodied
english-speaking society it is the only
thing that combats our idea that victims
can be can be blamed for their own
assaults in this society where we are
told that to have a funny joke it must
be at the expense of someone else in
this society where we are taught that it
is okay to be abusive neglectful and
ignorant art is a renovation I mean an
innovation are is drawing multiple King
drawing unconventional conclusions to an
equation with multiple outcomes
it&#39;s a map that has connected thousands
of society
since 15,000 BCE when the oh then JK
maybe okay when the Lascaux cave
paintings were said to the first
findings of Paleolithic spirituality
were said to have been created a circle
evidence like the Lascaux and Chava
caves raise the question what first
drove people to create art art in
psychology are closely tied and Edward
hares work creativity and mental illness
he writes the continuance of modern
society is based on a flow of original
ideas he later writes that a parallel
theory of social of genius emphasizes
its social origins on this theory
innovators are commonly people of
ability for social or genetic reasons
become social oddities it is their sense
of conflict with society that drives
them in to express unorthodox ideas
during this during the time that these
cave paintings were created people were
first starting to develop consciousness
first starting to realize that life is
more than just a happy tune that you can
dance to by yourself in your room it&#39;s a
multi-faceted song that often requires
us to find faith and one thing or
another in order to resolve our societal
conflicts in order to move forward in
our fields in order to move forward into
the fields that I will hereby generalize
as art what is wrong with the history
books is not that these figures have
learned to have struggled and learned to
overcome these struggles what is wrong
with the history books is that they
misrepresent these struggles and these
successes summarizing them shortly are
completely failing to mention them
altogether which brings me to
since and the 2007 movie ratatouille
gusto is known for his motto anyone can
cook and while the argument can be made
that cooking includes finding a way of
burning your house down in the process
it can often be said that art is kin
this idea can often be applied to art in
the same way we all have the ability to
create art is accessible our is broad
enough to interest people whether it be
through music
or through animated shorts and remember
that little thing called the American
Civil War yeah me neither
what&#39;s that well I mean that&#39;s probably
what future generations are going to say
with neuts cuts in Texan textbooks in
2015 Patti Hardy a Republican
representative declared slavery a side
issue of the Civil War which means that
most mentions of it will be diluted or
they will be completely omitted in
upcoming years other things to go
mentions of the Ku Klux Klan and other
extreme hate crimes often done in the
name of Christianity or done by white
people will be obliterated which makes
me think that our children will not will
grow up not knowing why people like Rosa
Parks had to rebel or may not learn
names altogether but what has already
been admitted from our textbooks JK
anyway
what has already been omitted from our
textbooks
well the 17th century ban of Irish
immigrants and prejudice towards hiring
Irish immigrants is often completely
skipped over in my own experience the
first time that was ever mentioned was
in my 8th grade US history book where it
was composed and compacted into a single
sentence other things that we don&#39;t
think about because you know they&#39;re cut
from curriculum
is like how Thomas Jefferson repeatedly
raped his salad his slave Sally Hemings
and forced to free her oh that&#39;s not
important what okay other things are
that have been limited or censored our
Chinese American culture it&#39;s often
compacted down to the creation of
Chinatown during the gold rush
Vietnamese culture directly equates to
the Vietnam War and nothing more and
nothing less and I don&#39;t personally
think that the lgbtq+ community has ever
been represented outside of the AIDS
epidemic if even that because it&#39;s a
sensitive topic much like the next thing
I&#39;m about to say women were forced to be
used as sex workers especially at a
schvitz did any of you know that I
didn&#39;t my teachers have never said
anything along those lines the art the
there&#39;s a reason that we have stories of
discrimination and the stories of social
justice fighting it and that&#39;s because
this is the basis of what it means to be
human
education of and response to social and
justice is what creates the outcome of
what our future generations will look
like it&#39;s what teaches kids how to act
it&#39;s what builds their character another
one of the most human things is art our
desire to communicate to produce it&#39;s no
coincidence that dictators first target
our schools and our artists and it&#39;s
because these two things are commonly
what form ideals and mindsets art is
barbaric
art is refined czar is undefined the
world we form will create impact
everyone if Andy Warhol hadn&#39;t painted
his big electric chair the 1960s
controversy of death by electric chair
would have been well let&#39;s just say
wouldn&#39;t have happens I wouldn&#39;t have
escalated in the same amount of time to
the point where death by electric chair
was banned across country and it was
declared cruel and unusual punishment by
the justice system if Pablo Picasso
hadn&#39;t painted his painting Guernica to
bring light to the Nazi bombings during
the Spanish Civil War then the warnings
of war&#39;s abuse wouldn&#39;t be as far as
spread as they are today what would have
happened if Sojourner Truth hadn&#39;t given
her a a a woman&#39;s speech would sexism
and dehumanization of black people be
even worse than it is today
would they have what the Mexican
Revolution still have succeeded would
Castro still have one in Cuba without
the help of street artists with the
anti-war movement have escalated to the
point or have skyrocketed without the
works of Yoko Ono or imagined by the
Beatles it&#39;s hard to say what our world
would look like today without the
conceptual art and the movements that
have followed them which brings me
through my first main point
art is a function of society and society
is a function of art this means that art
drives human perception and development
and to that because of this art can be
used as a successful platform for
activism for activism which okay and
Lerner&#39;s article global art through time
a global view they write human
experience has been logged it are
throughout the history of human
existence it has determined it has
showed us how people have thought over
time how they have had beliefs about
certain ideals etc etc it has connected
it has built a juxtaposition gallery a
propaganda that competes to get a world
and Theodor W Adorno was famous for his
idea that all of art is an uncommitted
crime
this means that art challenges the
status quo because it entices people to
form their own beliefs that may
contradict the given social and
political climate though perhaps settle
on nature according to UK&#39;s Learning
article in the article a the Holocaust
the infamous Nazi Party conducted the
Reich chamber of commerce which dealt
with all forms of media beginning in
1933 you could only view experience and
read that which was given to you when I
say the word censorship
you probably conjure up ideas of say
North Korea but we don&#39;t often think to
look as close as to our own families our
educators and our politicians who
carefully monitor the content that we
consume from early on everyone here is a
part of the school system in some way
whether that be because your kid is here
speaking today or because you&#39;re a
student or because you&#39;re a teacher like
the right this system of education is a
system whose planets revolve around a
Sun of education except that Sun is a
burnt-out star of liberal thinking like
the right call our plays our music our
words our symbols are all censored to
the point where they dictate what we are
allowed to freely express dictate to the
point where they dictate what we are
allowed to freely express but what if we
were able to use art to be more
productive more inspirational and more
educational what if we were able to use
art to counteracts the effects of racist
homophobic transphobic
sexist all-around xenophobic bigots what
if we could use it to fix this broken
society I&#39;m not supporting censorship
here I&#39;m supporting lifting the handicap
that it puts on our education I&#39;m
supporting removing things like not
talking about our history from all
cultures perspectives so let&#39;s remove
this form of censorship let&#39;s allow all
kinds of art in let&#39;s allow children to
make their own beliefs about who they
are as activists it&#39;s time to see
civilizations as they truly were and
Tsar through art thank you
