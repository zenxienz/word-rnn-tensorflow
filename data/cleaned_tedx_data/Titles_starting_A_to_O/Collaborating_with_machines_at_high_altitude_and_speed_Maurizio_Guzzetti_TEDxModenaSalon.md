good evening everyone this is obviously
a picture of the italian air
demonstration team fr√©chet thank you
Laurie and if you look carefully at the
top of the picture the distance between
one aircraft&#39;s wing tip and the tail of
the aircraft next to it is around 80
centimeters yeah I said right 88 0
centimeters
it varies Johnny airshow between 80
centimeters and 1.5 meters the speeds
are in the average of 300 knots which is
slightly below 600 kilometers an hour
and the next slide please
when when we do the formation crossings
the distance between the two formations
is a few meters and the relative speed
is above a thousand kilometers an hour
how do we do that a lot of people ask me
yeah here&#39;s a formation crossing a lot
of people ask me hey yeah you must have
been incredible computers in order to
manage that and my answer
normally amazes them because ironically
we&#39;re sitting in a high near constant
rate of high technology and we hardly
use any of that technology for a
formation flying as we rely on eyes and
our senses it&#39;s called seat-of-the-pants
flying basically it means our body feels
everything that goes on and reacts
accordingly
I&#39;ll tell you a little story about this
when I started flying commercial
aircraft big airplanes they put me in a
simulator and I was feeling nauseous
I was I was having problems so it was
physically sick because all of a sudden
what but this lied to me you know it
never lied for 20 years and all of a
sudden starts lying to me because what I
see and what I feel are not the same
thing
simulators have a very good visual
system and they have a motion system
which cannot fool any good pilot so I
had to spend months working hard to to
eliminate the sensations to turn these
regardless sensations that my body was
feeling and try to only rely on my sight
my eyes what I was seeing during an air
show there was there are quite a few
variables induced obviously one of them
is the terrain morphology other ones are
the weather the wind speed and
directions are extremely important in
their show so is the cloud based the
visibility and then the pilot we are a
variable ourselves we don&#39;t perform the
same way every day so we can&#39;t rely on a
standard performance to codify our
actual performance in the flight so no
two air shows are the same in case of
problems we solve the speeds are and
what the distances are you might well
appreciate that in case of problems we
need to react fast and we&#39;re talking
hundreds of a second how do we do that
because we cannot make a consistent
decision in a hundredth of a second
there&#39;s no way to do that we need to
revert to a stings one problem there are
a stings evolved to enable us to climb
trees and chase animals and certainly
not to fly high-performance aircraft so
here there&#39;s a need
- we cannot rely on pure instincts
because they&#39;re very fast lightning fast
but inadequate and inaccurate so here&#39;s
the need to educate and train our
instincts so as to have a quick reaction
a blink of an eye but it must be an
educated one it must be a consistent one
consistent with situation we&#39;re in well
how do we do that we build a mental
equation that contains as many of the
parameters apart as possible of a
situation surrounding us the weather
situation the wind comes from and this
and that so that in case of need we only
have to insert that very little
parameter that was missing and the
situation would be solved this equation
has to be constantly updated throughout
the airshow to compensate for our
position in space for instance and and
and all the variables involved during
the flying yourself and I I&#39;m not an
expert in car racing or motorbike racing
but I&#39;m quite an expert to dinner in
high-performance airplane flying and I
think the difference between an
excellent pilot and an average one it&#39;s
the ability to perform is that the
excellent pilot has the ability to
perform its task using only a certain
percentage of his CPU of his brain power
so as to leave a sizable amount of his
CPU time to improve its situational
awareness and and an adapted to the
contingent situation defying the high
performance flying itself is not it&#39;s
not easy it&#39;s very demanding and there
are quite a few problems emergency
situations and so on not so in the
civilian airliner flying obviously
thankfully and I don&#39;t need I don&#39;t mean
to scare you people by telling you an
experience I&#39;ve had a few years ago in
2004 it was one of the few occasions
where during civilian flight
I had to put to work these concepts I
just told you about it was 2004 and the
the flight I was flying a 767-300 from
Fiumicino to Havana and we were a few
Muccino on the runway 287 passengers
fully loaded airplane max takeoff weight
and during the take-off the right engine
explodes that was the result huge fire
and it happened at the worst possible
moment which is a few nos before v1 v1
is a speed that pilots compute beyond
which speed the airplane cannot anymore
stop on the way on the runway remaining
so you have to take off however that
happened three or four knots before v1
and if I&#39;d follow standard procedures I
would have stopped and if I had stopped
that day I would have killed people
because there was a quite a strong wind
from the right side during the takeoff
and with the right engine exploding and
and a lot of fuel on board during the
time I spent to stop on the runway the
wind would have brought the flames
towards the plane and they would have
hit the cabin and people would have died
and I elected to go there is no way that
my brain could have made that decision
considering all the parameters in about
one third of a second which is what it
took me to what took me to to decide to
continue the the takeoff and that
happened because before the takeoff
I did it and I do it every time and I do
it unconsciously even I am absorbing all
the parameters which is what good pilots
do really absorbing all the parameters
and building a mental picture of my
surroundings which is called situation
awareness in my mind new automatically
where the wind would be coming from
during the take-off which is from my
right so in one third of a second I
realized that the right engines on fire
and now we&#39;re in trouble if I stopped so
we continued and we came back to land
safely
no problem nobody got
the fire didn&#39;t stop so we had to come
back every wait but there was another
story so there are quite a few people
here scientists and and scholars
involved in and into an artificial
intelligence human machine interface
autonomous driving driving and flying
and my idea today is that I want to
throw there a little challenge well
that&#39;s not little it&#39;s a big challenge
that if we drive a car on a day-to-day
basis going to working back we are there
already we have cars going by themselves
really but if we want to fly or drive or
ride a motorbike in a racing environment
or high very demanding environments such
as as high performance lying we need to
introduce some instincts I don&#39;t know
how to call them but to me there are the
artificial instincts every one of us has
been driving one day and we feel there&#39;s
something wrong there&#39;s no clues out
they are telling us what&#39;s wrong but we
feel it with our skin something is wrong
and the hair rises on the back of our
neck and then sure enough something
happens so instincts in a way help us to
praveen something and to prevent
something and we the challenge to the
people studying at the vision test will
be to approximate instinct instinctive
reaction to try and predict what&#39;s going
to happen rather than than to react to
what&#39;s happened I&#39;ll bite fast thank you
very much
you
