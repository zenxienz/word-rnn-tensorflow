what if the best way to help yourself
was by helping someone else I became a
cardiologist because I wanted to help
people with heart disease but after just
a few years in practice I was getting
really frustrated
even though 80% of heart attacks can be
prevented by making healthier decisions
I felt like I couldn&#39;t even get my own
patients to take my recommendations to
heart back then I thought that making
healthy lifestyle choices was pretty
straightforward all you needed was a
little motivation and the right
information so I decided that I would
come up with the perfect prescription to
help I figured that if I could inspire
people and craft the right message then
I could change people&#39;s choices for them
I could be the self in their self help
so I took the first bold step forward
toward becoming a self-help guru I
created a Twitter account and then I
wrote a book I really did believe in the
power and potential for self help but um
embarrassed to say that I also really
believed in myself my own unique ability
to inspire that willpower and craft that
perfect ly oversimplified message for
anyone who would listen or click follow
retweet or buy I&#39;ll never forget the
strange mix of pride and
self-consciousness I thought when I
walked into Barnes &amp; Noble and saw it
there in the bookshelf for the first
time my lifestyle guide to heart health
that I earnestly wrote on my laptop at
the kitchen table was now just another
diet book with a bright yellow cover and
the tagline promised 200 ways to lose 20
pounds within weeks I was explaining the
miracle of cooking spray to Al Roker as
Kathie Lee and Hoda ran their fingers
through my hair on Nash
television i taste-tested vegetable soup
with dr. oz I traveled to Wisconsin to
speak at a wellness carnac carnival
really and I was the opening act for the
tooth fairy
this this was self help on steroids and
I realize now that I didn&#39;t believe a
word of it
even though I had written over 65
thousand of them do any of us really
believe it you really think motivation
and information are the answers
people are more motivated than ever
before the success of the self-help
industry tells that to us we&#39;re more
well-informed than ever before but we
keep looking for solutions in the same
old place a self-obsessed self-help
industry that reflects exactly what
you&#39;re looking at in the mirror it makes
you buy that book and watch that
infomercial and click on that app
because it makes you focus on just
yourself and I think we can all agree
that it isn&#39;t really helping it may sell
us distractions in the form of bright
yellow covers and tagline promises but
it ultimately just isolates us several
months went by after the book came out
and as you may be guessing it eventually
slipped off the bookshelves into Amazon
oblivion turns out I wasn&#39;t much of a
self-help guru after all but I was still
a doctor and I continue to believe in my
heart that people can change that my
patients can live healthier lives and
take advantage of that 80% opportunity
to prevent heart disease despite my own
disillusionment with the industry and my
own role within it I still believed in
self-help but rather than focus so much
on the self I started to wonder what
would happen if we focused instead on
the help what if the most direct path
toward helping yourself was helping
other people achieve their goals rather
than fill it
in isolation what have we all joined a
team and healed ourselves together so we
created a team a free walking and
running community group we call
ourselves heart to start and rather than
focus on speed or distance we train
intentionally to be inclusive and
emphasize vulnerability and friendship
on and off the track
we ask our athletes to celebrate the
journeys of their teammates even as they
make their own way research shows that
when you contribute to a team or are
active in any community your
participation reinforces your own value
as one of its members when we invest in
supporting our teammates they&#39;re
investing us in us too and when you
recognize your value your decisions
start to matter self-worth amplifies the
impact of the choices you make so
without even realizing it and without
buying a book or watching an infomercial
or downloading an app you can really
start to change so by creating this
community of helpers we were becoming
better selves hearts a start is now
celebrating its sixth season we&#39;ve
expanded to four other cities and
brought together hundreds of amazing
teammates with really incredible
journeys Chris lost over a hundred and
ten pounds without my book but by
working hard
attending weekly workouts and more
importantly spending quality time with
their teammates afterwards Tracey was so
nervous to exercise around other people
but with her team at her back she&#39;s now
an ultra-marathoner and our newest coach
Russell began his journey after a
diagnosis of congestive heart failure
just a few steps at a time but with the
support of his team and his family he
recently celebrated his recovery by
climbing to the top of Mount Fuji Katy
didn&#39;t need to climb a mountain she
wanted to be a grandma who could get
down on the carpet and play with her
grandkids she can do that now and she
can chase them around
so many of us were accustomed to this
idea that we needed to travel our own
journey alone not anymore
none of us needs to so even as we were
becoming better selves I started to
think about who else could we be helping
maybe by connecting our team with my
patients in some way we can incorporate
this model of self-help into delivering
health care but how as a caregiver
how would you share your compassion
beyond your clinic as a patient can you
really fill a prescription for community
as a health care system how can we
infect people with value and self-worth
instead of spending our energy on
retweets and follows and satisfaction
surveys and sales rankings what if we
turned the self-help industry on its
head and invested instead in a health
care system not just a team that heels
it forward in health care when you share
your time and your resources your
knowledge and strategy to make someone
else&#39;s world a better place that&#39;s the
very heart of prevention and that&#39;s also
the heart of being a volunteer what if
we put the two together could
volunteering help prevent heart disease
we&#39;ve known for a long time that people
who are charitable with their time
improve their social connectedness 70%
of people with depression who volunteer
improve their symptoms but research is
also showing that volunteering is
associated with a lower risk of heart
disease and even mortality independent
of risk factors socioeconomic status age
or gender communities with double the
rate of volunteerism experience a lower
incidence of heart disease and death by
one-third giving your time gives you
more time but why why would being
charitable make us healthier could
volunteering improve your own health
care I like to think of charity as a
natural remedy because it&#39;s a reflection
of our own
ability it breaks down the barriers that
illness can create around us and it
allows us to live the empathy that we
seek from others illness can isolate us
I believe that the self-help industry
can also isolate us charity connects us
volunteering is also associated with an
increased sense of self-esteem and
self-efficacy the word charity is
actually derived from the Latin Caritas
which can be translated into esteem self
esteem makes us feel that we deserve
this wonderful life and self-efficacy
convinces us that we&#39;re also capable of
achieving it did you know the charity is
actually a renewable resource the more
you give the more you get the more you
volunteer the more you can change and
the beautiful part is that you then have
more to give whether it&#39;s time or
kindness or just being there for someone
else that&#39;s how hard to start began to
change by adding action to our activity
by moving beyond self-help toward
helping other selves last year we
started mixing weekly workouts with
opportunities to heal it forward at the
food bank and at the Humane Society this
year we&#39;re expanding the model to our
free heart screenings for kids we&#39;re
collecting cans of food to give to the
hungry we&#39;re teaching art classes in our
waiting room and accepting donations to
place defibrillators back into our
community our patients are now
volunteering to support one another on
their paths through treatment and
recovery and when you&#39;re helping each
other as a team
everyone&#39;s a climber but everyone&#39;s also
a guide we&#39;re learning that doing good
makes you feel better can you imagine
all the untapped opportunities we have
to help one another and feel better
together
what would healthcare feel like if your
doctor&#39;s office invited you to bring a
can of food or a toy to your next
appointment and shared it with another
family in the clinic who needed it more
what could we accomplish with support
groups if instead of meeting in some
basement at a hospital
we planted gardens or built houses or
constructed soccer fields or read to
kids what if your own doctor prescribed
Community Service and filled the
prescription by your side team work
changed the way that I believe in
self-help but charity is changing the
way that I believe in health care let&#39;s
find more ways to get better together by
doing good together
if you do yourself will find health but
where you least expected it not in a
book not an infomercial not in an app
and definitely not in a guru but it&#39;s
part of a team let&#39;s heal it forward
thank you so much
