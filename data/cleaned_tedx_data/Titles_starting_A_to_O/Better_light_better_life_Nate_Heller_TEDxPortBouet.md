for the past six years I&#39;ve been
building a company called peg Africa we
sell solar home lighting systems to
people who live in in off-grid villages
in Ghana and now in Cote d&#39;Ivoire it&#39;s
my passion it&#39;s my in my dream for a
long time to do something like this and
I wake up every day excited about it and
I wanted to tell you a little bit about
what we do and our journey and some
things that learned along the way one of
the things that that I&#39;m most proud of
with this company might sound a little
bit strange I&#39;m most proud I would say
of the fact that they were actually a
for-profit business we&#39;re not an NGO
we&#39;re a company and the people that we
sell to they live in tiny little
villages far far away they make on
average probably one to six dollars a
day and a lot of people say how can you
be a for-profit company focused on on
those kind of customers and some people
say it in a way where they&#39;re appalled
and some people say in a way like that
people don&#39;t have money how can you be a
company focused on them but I think that
in some situations it&#39;s actually a way
way better way to help people my goal is
not to make money the goal is to help
people if you&#39;re a for-profit oh okay
this goes fast you bring some some
things to the table that are a lot more
difficult if you&#39;re a charity something
like that first of all empowerment if
you are a company rather than a charity
people don&#39;t want what you&#39;re providing
them they&#39;ll stop buying it and you&#39;ll
go out of business
second is sustainability people have to
pay for what you&#39;re offering
then they&#39;ll value it and I&#39;ll probably
make a lot more use out of it and
finally scalability the problems that
need to be solved in this world and the
problems that we&#39;re trying to solve are
so big there&#39;s so many people that that
need support in these ways that oh the
charity money available in the world is
good enough couldn&#39;t get anywhere near
it but if you can figure out a way to
find a business model where you&#39;re
actually
making a profit and generating a return
on capital it goes back to investors
there are huge amounts of money out
there to help you grow and you can
really help reach much much larger
groups of people when I think about this
model there there are two different main
examples that I think of and at least
one of them you would never really
consider a social enterprise I think of
mobile phones and microfinance mobile
phone industry definitely not social
they&#39;re pretty much just in it for the
money but about 15 years ago I lived for
two years in a tiny little village in
Senegal that was off-grid and to get to
a phone I had to bicycle ten kilometres
into town and the change that that has
come from from mobile phones is just
incredible microfinance is definitely
controversial and definitely the
interest rates can be high but if you
compare it to informal moneylenders it&#39;s
a step change and I think of these two
innovations as possibly having brought
the most change to Africa in the past 20
years of anything I can think of and
what they do and the reason why they&#39;re
able to be successful and they&#39;re able
to be profitable to every to scale is
because they do all this by giving
people something better than what they
had before and giving to them cheaper
than they were paying previously so I
started out as a nonprofit guy I was one
of those people I would just wanted you
to do good I wanted to figure out how to
be useful I came from a lucky background
and I wanted to give back I decided to
join the Peace Corps
move to a tiny little village in Senegal
when I was 14 years old and talked about
it for eight years and finally actually
did that when I graduated from college
and eventually got to where I worked my
way up and I had a job at the UN but as
I got further into the big machine of of
that International Development thing I
just did not feel useful I felt like I
was doing research for policies that I
wasn&#39;t sure we&#39;re really gonna affect
anybody&#39;s lives and I started hearing
about these models that seemed
they were really directly bringing
benefits to people and they weren&#39;t
wasteful and I wanted to do something
like that
I was trying to find some way the
problem that I could help solve in a way
that was was better and cheaper and so I
quit my job at the UN I didn&#39;t know
anything about business at the time so I
went to business school and a few years
later I met this guy that&#39;s my
co-founder Hugh Whelan and that&#39;s our
very first company and he had the idea
of of trying to work on a problem that
is a major arbitrage opportunity a major
situation where people are paying way
too much for something that&#39;s really not
good
and that problem is the dark if I have
been really smart I would have had them
switch off the lights has anybody did
anybody grow up in this room in an
off-grid place or has anybody spent a
significant amount of time in a place
off-grid there&#39;s no electricity yeah so
as I said I lived in a village with no
electricity for two years and it was
beautiful and it was peaceful and at
night it was lovely to see the stars but
it&#39;s really tough if you think about you
know especially this part of the world
you know it gets dark every day of the

year around 6:00 6:30 p.m. and after
it&#39;s dark if you don&#39;t have electricity
you know you maybe you have a kerosene
lamp you can get around your house but
you can&#39;t really read you can&#39;t study
you can&#39;t cook you can&#39;t work if you&#39;re
you know family maybe has one flashlight
if you&#39;re a kid you want to study and
then your mom takes the flashlight so
she can cook and you can&#39;t study anymore
if you have a phone you have to go
kilometres into town to charge it so you
can only do that a couple times a week
and you have to buy batteries all the
time and you end up paying for this
terrible amount of level of service a
lot more than somebody who&#39;s connected
to the grid and technology has the
potential to really change that and this
is what we set out to try to help with a
solar lighting system this is a system
that we currently sell I have a demo
I&#39;ll show you guys afterwards if
anybody&#39;s interested in the cocktail
we&#39;ve got three bright lights which
light up a house
inside and out so everybody can do
everything at the same time it includes
a solar charge radio flashlight and a
phone charger so you can pretty much
take care of all your needs we now have
bigger systems even that have TVs and it
costs way way less than what people were
paying for kerosene and batteries and
phone charging cause so much less I
actually made a chart that the clicker
might not work on if you think about
somebody who&#39;s buying kerosene and
batteries they spend maybe four dollars
weekly means they&#39;re spending about $200
a year and they got to replace the
radios in the lamps and flashlights
they&#39;re spending another $50 it&#39;s around
two hundred and sixty dollars a year if
you think about that over five years
that&#39;s about thirteen hundred dollars
with the solar home system pay about two
hundred and fifty dollars and that&#39;s all
you pay you&#39;re done so they save over a
thousand dollars on this thing that&#39;s
way way better so why doesn&#39;t everybody
have one well the big problem is upfront
cost two hundred and fifty dollars is a
heck of a lot of money for somebody who
makes one to six dollars a day either
they don&#39;t have that money or they do
but they don&#39;t really trust something
like this very much because there&#39;s a
lot of Chinese junk out there and it&#39;s
too big an investment to spend all at
once so you have to figure out a way to
give it to them so they can pay the same
way they were paying for kerosene over
time if you can give it to them on
credit where they pay a deposit and then
they pay a daily rate it can add up to
exactly the same amount of money paid
over a year but suddenly it becomes much
more affordable and then for the rest of
the five years that the products gonna
last you don&#39;t have to pay any money at
all so this is what we were thinking
about and this is what we really wanted
to do so we tried to do this initially
with microfinance banks but these
customers are really difficult for a
microfinance bank or a regular Bank any
kind of microfinance Bank because not
that they&#39;re necessarily bad payers but
it&#39;s really hard to tell they live way
out in these villages they don&#39;t have a
credit rating because they&#39;ve never done
electronic transactions and they don&#39;t
have any collateral that you&#39;d use to
take away if they don&#39;t pay so how do
you possibly
sell to them on credit well there&#39;s this
new mechanism called pay-as-you-go solar
that we&#39;ve been using for the past three
years starting in East Africa and we are
one of the first ones to do it in West
Africa and what it has is a metered
system where inside the device there&#39;s a
meter they buy credit on the meter by
paying off their loan and if they stop
buying credit the device runs down and
it stops working so the system actually
acts as own collateral oh yeah the
second major innovation is mobile money
a lot of you guys have heard of that I&#39;m
sure but it&#39;s basically if you haven&#39;t
it&#39;s a bank account tied to your mobile
phone number so people can make
electronic transactions and send money
to friends relatives or service
providers like us that means we don&#39;t
have to go collect all the money and it
means there&#39;s an electronic record of
everything people pay so now not only
are we bringing these people light we&#39;re
bringing them Financial Inclusion
because after they&#39;ve paid off the
device we&#39;ve got collateral sitting in
their house for another five years a
device we could switch off and we&#39;ve got
a year of payment transactions so now if
they need other things on credit there&#39;s
suddenly a very good customer if they&#39;ve
been a good payer we sell them clean
cookstoves smart phones and solar TVs as
add-on products afterwards we also give
free micro insurance to all of our good
payers so that they don&#39;t get sick and
have to go to the hospital can&#39;t afford
it I was gonna give a few tips about the
journey and the difficulties but it
looks like we&#39;re very very quickly some
of the things that I say to people that
are interested in doing this kind of
thing it&#39;s been a really really long and
and difficult journey I decided I wanted
to do social enterprise about ten years
ago and I went to school and then I
spent two years working for a startup
that didn&#39;t start up who I didn&#39;t get
along at all with the founder I didn&#39;t
know if I was ever gonna get anywhere I
came and joined Hugh in Ghana took a
major risk on that
we spent two years changing business
models about four times and changing
suppliers about five times we had every
crisis in the book we had investors who
said our our investment decision has
been postponed by about four months and
our money ran out after about one month
so we had to stop getting paid for about
six months and just to keep the doors
open even without knowing whether they
would say yes and you know we wouldn&#39;t
have to shut it down anyway it&#39;s been a
really really interesting journey with
many many failures but we&#39;ve now given
light to about 150 thousand people and
employed about 400 thank you and yeah
it&#39;s been great and I feel really
honored to be here
