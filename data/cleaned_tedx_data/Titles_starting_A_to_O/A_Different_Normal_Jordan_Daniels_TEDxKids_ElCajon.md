whoa that was cool right well if you had
scoliosis doing awesome tricks like
those would be out of the question many
people have heard of scoliosis but how
many people really understand what it
means to have scoliosis today I would
like to share with you my family&#39;s
experience with scoliosis as an
eleven-year-old I have learned a lot
about this medical issue how because my
eight-year-old brother Jermaine has
scoliosis today I&#39;m gonna share some
facts with you because I believe to
spread awareness of scoliosis you&#39;re
gonna need to understand it scoliosis is
a rare spinal issue that causes the
spine to curve instead of being straight
like it&#39;s supposed to be as you can see
there is a major difference between the
normal spine and a scoliotic spine
scoliosis also has a big effect on the
way the neck and shoulder blade face
there&#39;s neck is often twisted and the
shoulders are often slanted Bob Marley
once said you never know how strong you
are until being strong is the only
choice you have daily life with
scoliosis is kinda normal except for the
everyday challenges such as carrying
backpacks or wearing shirts now you&#39;re
probably wondering carrying backpacks
are wearing shirts but the reason why
people with scoliosis have these
everyday challenges is because of their
neck and shoulder blade as I said before
the neck the shoulders are slanted and
so that doesn&#39;t give the shorter
backpack of proper balance but there&#39;s
hope to help with scoliosis my brother
had a surgery where the surgeons put
titanium in his neck to help straighten
it out and while I&#39;m talking about this
surgery I would like to thank dr. Newton
and Rady Children&#39;s Hospital for taking
amazing care of my brother and now I
would like to introduce to you my
brother Jermaine thank you
[Applause]
you
