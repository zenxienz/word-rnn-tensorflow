I was on the bottom of this tank April
14 1989 a nice start
slowly but steadily climbing upwards
trying to save my own life at the top I
can see a white light 17 feet above me
and I see a hand stretching down and I
climbed up 17 feet with everything I had
and I held it I smiled and I went down
in this 35 thousand gallon tanker that
was carrying fumes from liquefied
petroleum gas my coworker Pablo said
that I gave him a smile and I went down
by the time one of my co-workers my
father saw sternness came up they were
scarce everywhere and they were telling
themselves that I was dead that he first
born was at the bottom of that tank
through a small little hole where
everybody can see me and that I was dead
he couldn&#39;t accept that fact he knew I
had to be alive the same man that just a
few years prior had seen his own little
girl died in Mexico probably and most
likely my earliest memory as a first
person to see my own little sister died
of the number one caso death in the
developing countries which is diarrhea
and dehydration how can be possible how
did I get into that hole first of all
how did I see this light on the top of
this place how did these young men at
the age of 21 who had come to the United
States from very humble beginnings in
Mexico at the age of 19 as an illegal
migrant farmworker went on to work in
the railroad to go to Community College
to go to UC Berkeley Harvard Medical
School Hopkins and now here at the Mayo
Clinic how can that boy who were
speaking Tomatoes with this very same
hands is now doing some of the most
complex brain surgery in the world and
it&#39;s walking the hallways with some of
the most brilliant minds and medicine in
science I will tell you a little bit
about that story
so we all have amazing role models in my
life people ask me who is the greatest
physician the greatest healthcare
provider that you ever met in your life
and I say undoubtably my grandmother
that&#39;s the one with the dark glasses you
can actually see the resemblance I tell
you she was an amazing woman
very strict she was the one who would
actually put boundaries in my life
that&#39;s a little boy I got into a lot of
trouble guys I have to meet it I was
full of energy full of life but she was
truly the one who taught me that it was
okay every now and a to deviate from
that path in which life puts us together
cuz she through her own work came from
very humble beginnings she herself had
very little but she were hard her whole
life to give hope to those who had less
and I learned that it was okay in my own
path in my own life to deviate over the
course of time I had other superheroes
and other heroes one of them is this guy
Caliban and I remember as a little boy
this is around the time I was about 3 to
4 years old you can actually see right
there an amazing size of my head little
shoulders a lot of my colleagues and
neurosurgery say you know what Alfredo
we can actually put a shunt that is when
you deviate water from the brain down to
your belly because you have such a big
head but I dream I dream I tell you
about this TallyMan move I used to bet

every Thursday at 11:00 in the morning
these magazine this comic we used to
come out here who tested one person with
my friends we put our money together and
we buy we pass it around and he kept
this classic move where we he would
actually fight for foes altogether and
he would actually do the Cali man move
which is as follows you had four people
two in the front two in the back and
then you jump like a panther in the air
hit two with your hands and to your feet
and these kids were just really being
tough on us so I tell my three castles
my brother a lot of Antonia Arturo and
my brother Gabrielle I say guys we can
take it anymore
these guys are really giving us a hard
time they&#39;re taking advantage of us I am
going to practice the calaman and move
so we can get him back in like mice my
brother in my cousin says you&#39;re gonna
hurt us I said relax guys I&#39;m only gonna
tap you so here I am I jump up in the
air and boom I don&#39;t hit anybody I
landed on my face I turn around all the
kids are looking down and they are
bursting in laughter and I run to the
house and I&#39;m cried and I&#39;m doing all
this kind of stuff and my mom says son
was strong mom today all my dreams were
shattered I realized this is how I
regret that little boy was I realized
that if I can do the Cali man maneuver
for sure Cali man does not exist and
cannot do the Cali man maneuver but my
dreams of Cali man didn&#39;t end there yes
that is me and that&#39;s not the only
embarrassing picture I was to show you
and I had the dream one day I knew that
Cali man maneuver was gonna come up and
he was gonna be used and that day came I
run 1987 this is the site of the US
Mexican border
seen from the American side that is
precisely the place where I have the
fence
January 2nd 1987 not once because I got
caught but a second time in the same
night imagine that how many people do
the same mistake twice
but I knew I was going to make it that
was my very first house that I bought
after being homeless for about three
months I lived in the back of a 1979
Ford Pinto bright yellow and everybody
knows that those four pintles were
discontinued because every time they got
here from behind they would explode a
major fire were starting I was sleeping
right on top of that gas tank so I
bought this being my first house and I
thought it was a dream house and I was
happy back then as happy as I am today
doing what I do is a brain surgeon I
always felt that persevere and
persistence was important this is me as
a welder around 1989 when I was in
Community College right around this time
the number one song was by rock set it
was called the Luke so I told you wasn&#39;t
done with embarrassing pictures you know
I thought about this look and I thought
about these dreams that I had I went on
to go to UC Berkeley then to Harvard
Medical School and this is a picture
when I became a US citizen
in 1997 thanks to the immigration reform
of California as a migrant farm worker
which the way that I came to this
country thank you
so here I am
thinking to myself this is the moment
that I so long dreamed about I am proud
to be Mexican I am proud to be American
I am proud to be the bridge between two
countries two cultures two types of
people that can work together even
better if we figure out a way to build
bridges among our countries in our
societies but my lessons and humility
were not gonna end and I tell you the
pictures we&#39;re not gonna end so that&#39;s
that is me in their pink cardigan
sweater with the bolo tie and I remember
my father says to me son
we&#39;re gonna take a family picture say
yeah he goes don&#39;t you just want to
cover and I said dad this is my moment
to show my amazing box and says to me
son one day you will regret that picture
but I knew that things were gonna get
better I went on to give the
commencement speech at Harvard this is
now 1999 you know there&#39;s a picture of
my wife Anna in our family right there
my father which was actually younger
than I am today when I was graduating it
was their first trip to Harvard Medical
School and I was so amazed and so proud
to be part of this society and then went
on to do my residency in San Francisco
finished in six years went on to Hopkins
promoted to full professor within six
years as well and then I came here when
I am writing a new essay in which I am
trying to understand how can it be
possible that a brain surgeon makes more
than a tomato picker because I did both
jobs by the way so I&#39;m trying to figure
out and of course it&#39;s education I am
aware of that but I am also trying to
figure out that it was the same kid with
the same brains the same hands that
continued to do this now the fun part
doesn&#39;t end Brad Pitt and his company
Plan B they got together with Disney
they&#39;re doing a movie I put this because
he was Jeremy kleiner who reached out to
me in 2007 and says I want the life
fries to be moving I was really
reluctant it took us ten years for them
to convince me that I really wanted to
do something so here I am my son David
is 16 at the time he says dad is it true
they&#39;re gonna make a
movie about you say yes who&#39;s gonna play
you I said this is the moment this is
the moment for my son to realize that
his old man is the man and I say son
they&#39;re thinking well they want they
want to make this movie real they want
someone really talk and as you can tell
I&#39;m only about five seven with cowboy
boots they want someone really muscular
and as you can tell I&#39;m more in the
stocky category they want someone really
good-looking and as you can tell I&#39;m
probably more on the charmer charming
category you know but I say son they&#39;re
thinking about Dwayne the rock Johnson
he laughed the way you did and he said
dead he&#39;s most likely gonna be Danny
DeVito playin it true and signed here√≠s
our patients in my work I work with the
most dangerous type of disease which is
cancer cancer will kill about thirteen
million people but the year 2030 will be
the number one cause of death in the
world my role as a brain cancer
researcher and as a brain surgeon is to
try to tame the king of those cancers
which is brain cancer to try to make it
a disease that is controllable the way
that I think about this is the way that
I think about it in our house this is
the king of the house his name is
Leonardo spider-man quinones everybody
knows he is large and in charge and no
one messes with him the dogs rocky
Napoleon Luna there was the other cat
that wouldn&#39;t mess with him but he is
controllable we still have the
possibility of making the most
aggressive cancer a controlled disease I
think about the work that we do together
here in your backyard we produce tons of
innovation technology books I&#39;ve been
the main editor but this is our work I
am surrounded by many many people that
continue to push me and challenge me
every single day to change the world and
this is the work that we are putting
together Journal after Journal cover
after cover book after book because we
believe that that&#39;s the only way that
we&#39;re gonna find new cures we believe in
education and empower in over the last
few years I with our team of colleagues
created a foundation that is 501c3 that
we have done over hundred surgeries
around the world some of the most campus
sergers where I bring a team of 15 to 20
health care providers and the most
amazing surgeons in the world and we do
that just like my grandmother did for
free we give hope to those who have very
little hope is extraordinarily important
in my life healing opportunity
persistent and patience you&#39;ve seen it
through my own life
education and empowerment this reminds
me of a quote from The Hunger Games yes
the trilogy I read all three over
President Snow tells about Katniss
Everdeen that the only emotion that is
more powerful than fear is hope yes I
believe in I hope and I am afraid every
single day whether I am in the
laboratory and the surgical or I am
afraid of what&#39;s gonna happen I used
that fear as the energy that empowers me
to build more hope to change the world I
leave you with this picture remember the
other one was from the American side
looking at the border between Calexico
and Mexicali where I kept the fence that
is exactly the same place where I have
defense but is now last year taken from
the Mexican side and this was done by a
Emmy Award and Peabody Award winner
greaser children who took this picture
as part of a documentary he&#39;s been
making and send it to me and I remember
at the moment that I was walking away
from that he asked me how do you feel
and I said Richard I couldn&#39;t do it
today and it says you&#39;re getting old and
he says to me and I don&#39;t mean old in
age he&#39;s just your dreams you are
getting satisfied with the status good
he said to me and I look at this picture
all the time every single time that I
think about our dreams I go back and I
think about determination resilient
exciting excitement admiration
mentorship all of them leading to
strength so we can change this world so
we can make this world a better place
for our future generations thank you
very much have a great day guys
[Applause]
