good afternoon
gives me great pleasure to be standing
here in front of you the theme that I
have chosen this afternoon to talk about
there&#39;s a story about a storyteller now
very often I meet people who look at me
and then they are not sure where they
have seen me before and they tell me I
think I&#39;ve seen you somewhere but you a
judge on a you know a dance show on
television over you part of a quiz show
somewhere else etc and I tell them no
but then they look at me answer and ask
me but what do you do it&#39;s at this point
that I know the the long and short of
this problem called the Gettier problem
now what is that look at that okay now
the Gettier problem is a problem that
arises in philosophy in mathematics and
in logic so you assume you see something
and you assume it&#39;s the truth it is the
truth but the assumption is for all the
wrong reasons so if you look at that
there&#39;s this chappie walking there he
sees a rock and he thinks it&#39;s a sheep
he gets close and then he realizes that
it is a rock it isn&#39;t a sheep but then a
sheep pops up from behind so was he
right in assuming that rock was a sheep
or was that a sheep in the first place
so that is a Gettier problem which is
what I face all the time and people look
at me and ask me I think I know you but
I don&#39;t know you why and they think they
know me for all the wrong reasons so at
that point is when I think that maybe I
should make up a story and tell them
something that they would like to hear
so tell them maybe I&#39;m a wrestler maybe
I&#39;m an astronaut maybe I&#39;m a veterinary
doctor whatever but in the last minute I
lose my nerve and
I say I do nothing at that point there
is this big thought bubble that is
growing around their head which is no no
no she&#39;s lying she she can&#39;t be doing
nothing what does she really do now you
must wonder why is it that I can&#39;t just
turn around and tell them that I&#39;m a
writer the reason being that a writer to
me seems someone who&#39;s very lofty and
very distanced from what I actually do
which is tell stories I&#39;m a storyteller
now I had thought about this title
called a storyteller several times and
asked myself who or what is a
storyteller a storyteller someone who
does more than just narrate stories a
storyteller is someone who begins with
an idea and into that mixture of
thoughts goes a lot of things there is
history there is geography there is
mathematics there is physics there is
chemistry and if you&#39;re an atheist you
can call it nature and if you&#39;re a
believer you can call it God all of this
goes into what a storyteller does and
then there is something else that
happens perhaps only in the world of
literature there is something called a
pause now a pause is when the
subconscious mind which has been
gathering all this facts and information
memories and observations all of it goes
into a file and it is lit under a
crucible called
the imagination and this is what creates
stories this is a very very famous quote
by Nabokov the author of Lolita for
those of you who don&#39;t know who he is it
says basically that having the proper
quote is there but if you don&#39;t want to
read it it says that the first story was
not born when a man came I mean a boy
came out of a valley screaming
wolf wolf and there was a wolf behind
him the first story was born when a boy
came out of a valley screaming wolf wolf
and there was no wolf behind him so you
see that is where a story begins there
is imagination there is observation and
there is reality so what I&#39;m going to do
this afternoon as I stand here before
you is to take you through a few
instances of how through my own life
anecdotal examples of how stories are
born or how my stories were born
now serendipity is something that
happens in each one of our lives it
happens to as many a time what a
storyteller does is to be able to
identify serendipity and make that into
fodder for imagination make that into
substance for a story I come from a very
small village in Kerala it&#39;s called moon
Dakota ku Russia it is so tiny that
nobody knows anything about it in fact
there is nothing that happens there if
you see that that&#39;s the extent of the
village as of now I&#39;m not talking about
you know 10 years ago 15 years ago so
the village is so tiny I like I was
saying no Mahatma has been you know has
ever lived there or was born there there
is no form of you know handicrafts or
craft forms that originated from there
which make people go looking for it
nothing of significance happens there to
anybody except you know the natural
course of life and death
but what moon Dakota girl she has died
and I&#39;m very proud of that is that it
has a wicked sense of humor and irony
we don&#39;t have an ATM we don&#39;t have a
movie theater but we have a Cricket Club
which is called MCC which is a joke on
you know the Marilyn bond Cricket Club
and it is one dakota gursha Cricket Club
we have something like five shops like
what you see there but we still call
ourselves the city
in 1984 when the first bus began flying
between the nearest town Shore node and
moon Dakota cursive and you know the bus
came they were still designating bus
stands and deciding what to call it so
they came to this point where there were
four shots
the conductor stopped and they looked
around and they said let&#39;s call this one
Dakota or she City and so it became
under category City the politics and
this village is very interesting it&#39;s
just in the 1950s it was a stronghold
for communist activity and so they
started calling this village also Moscow
but in now in recent times you have a
strong presence of Congress you have a
strong presence of the BJP
you have the Muslim League and you have
the Communist Party because of which
every election time is like a game of
Russian roulette you don&#39;t know who&#39;s
going to win and by what margin my
family goes back there by four hundred
and sixty years at least and my parents
when they retired from service moved
back to the village that was our
ancestral village in true South Indian
tradition my parents are related and so
they decided to go back and once they
were there you know it took them after
six years they still couldn&#39;t break into
this community you know a village is so
tight I mean everywhere we like to
believe of villages as this bucolic
idyllic places but they can be the most
closed community most sanctimonious kind
of people so after about 6 years my
parents were sick and tired of it and
they said they were going to leave and
they decided they were going to sell the
property I was heartbroken because I&#39;ve
always felt this great connection to
this place so I thought I was going to
chronicle this village for my son so at
a point in life when he would turn
around and ask me where did we come from
I would just give him this book and say
here this is our history I started
writing one chapter down I suddenly
stopped and I said what am i doing
chronicling a village this is the
material for my first
this is what I&#39;m going to be writing
about how little villages are simply a
microcosm of the entire universe that we
live in everything that you can see in
the world around you you can see in a
little village we just don&#39;t want to be
you know we don&#39;t fear and denial most
of the time not wanting to accept it and
so my first novel the better man was
born I published my first two novels I
had a certain you know element of Fame
and celebrity Dom etcetera I was being
constantly invited for dinner parties
where I would be lionized I was invited
for speaking engagements I was invited
for you know various kinds of things I
was going on world to us for my books
and stuff like that and at some point in
my life I took a step back and asked
myself is this artistic success all this
Fame whatever you know being lionized
having giving out interviews whatever
awards whatever you win is this truly a
measure of artistic success or is
artistic success something that an
artist himself or herself understands
when you know that you&#39;ve raised the bar
for yourself
you&#39;ve pushed yourself out of your
comfort zone and that you have made a
certain impact not just on the world
around you but within yourself so this
was a question that was troubling me it
was a it was a huge kind of you know
thing that sat on my head all the time I
was reeling my work and asking myself
what am i doing am I going to play to
the gallery and just keep writing the
same kind of things that have got me
success or am I going to push the
barrier higher okay so then I remembered
something very significant that had
happened in my life I was working in
advertising and one day I walking into
work and it so it was a little agency so
it you know steps go up and so on I
climb up the steps
and go there and in the reception is a
kadhai Kelly dancer
for those of you who haven&#39;t seen what
Okada Kelly dances look at the costume
on the right the one with the crown
there he is standing in full costume in
the middle of the reception so the
reception must be not even as large as
the dice that I&#39;m standing on he&#39;s
standing there and he&#39;s doing mudra as
he&#39;s doing this he&#39;s doing this and
everything and there the rest of my
colleagues are standing there and there
were sniggers they were giggles because
to them he was just a kind of strange
figure of ridicule who had appeared one
morning in the office reception and then
I saw him you know hold his costume like
this go down the stairs they put him up
into the back of a pickup truck
and they took him away I went back into
the office and I said what was going on
so they said oh you know so by the way I
live in Bangalore so they said this he
was being brought here as a gimmick as a
living walking talking rate card for an
up country publication now for those of
you who don&#39;t know what a rate card is
it is something that publications
periodicals newspapers we are talking
pre-internet period would hand out to
various advertising agencies saying that
you know if you were to do a quarter
page advertisement this is what it will
cost you in black and white this is what
it will cost you in Carlow etc so there
are different kinds of rates so since
there were so many publications in those
days they needed to do something
gimmicky to catch the attention of the
media planner in the advertising agency
and this man who had probably put in
nine years of work because before you
actually get onto a stage you have to go
through a nine year intense routine of
learning was suddenly reduced to being a
prop and you see this all the time you
see a car the Kali dancer being used as
a prop
detergent commercials sometimes he&#39;s
used as a you know as a background
dancer
you know in a movie song sometimes you
see four or five of them standing there
and racing their legs like chorus
dancers and some is something in me died
at that thought that here is a person
who has put in so much and I wouldn&#39;t
blame him because he has absolutely no
you know placed you stand there and to
do perform his art because fewer and
fewer people are watching critically and
he has to take what he has to but I was
thinking about the world we live in
which red uses art to nothing and so
what are the basic tenets of Kathakali
for instance is that a minute on the
stage
demands hundred hours of practice and
generally acadec early performance can
stretch as long as five hours so just
imagine the amount of work he would have
had to put in and he has absolutely no
opportunity to perform at that point I
knew that I wanted to write a book
exploring the concept of artistic
success I have no answers I had no
answers I still don&#39;t have a clear-cut
answer but at least I was able to arrive
at a certain understanding that for me
it might be different for every other
artist in the world but for me artistic
success is basically about pushing the
barrier about taking it to the next
level to be able to tell myself at the
end of it all that this was worth it
because if you look at it what is the
meaning or significance of art in
everyday life if you look at it it&#39;s
just a piece of art that you hang on a
wall it&#39;s a probably a piece of music
that you listen to when you&#39;re climbing
I mean when you&#39;re in an elevator or in
your dentist reception area
it is probably a book you read and then
leave behind and never look at again but
somebody somewhere has been sitting and
working on it and toiling endlessly on
it and for what joy as some other
speakers have said before and yesterday
I was having dinner with my publisher
and she was telling me about a cricketer
who&#39;s writing his biography and
once the the economics of it was
explained to him he turned around and
said why do writers write there is no
money in it writers write because we
can&#39;t help ourselves we have to write so
every artist creates because they can&#39;t
help it they need to create so yes there
are serendipity
there is self-examination but there is
one other thing that as a storyteller I
need to be able to create my stories I
cannot live within this ivory tower of
my own existential angst and you know
tell myself this is what I&#39;m going to be
writing about so I sometimes it happens
and then I should know when to do it so
September 21st of September 2013 I was
working and then there was a news alert
saying that there was this shooting that
happened in the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
friends of mine very close friends of
mine live in Nairobi and every Saturday
morning they would go to the mall and I
was petrified I was wondering what
happened and I you know managed to get
through to them and realize they were
safe I went back to my writing but later
in the day as the news alerts were kind
of coming in I realized that there was
something else there that you know it
had been a shoot out by an Islamic group
and they had segregated the group into
two sets of audiences I mean two sets of
people they said that Muslims and the
non-muslims the Muslims were allowed to
go they turned around and they
apparently asked everybody to make sure
that they were Muslims one of the things
that they did was to ask them the name
of the prophet&#39;s mother now I have been
to several schools here in India and one
of the things that I realize all the
time is that I asked the children there
tell me what is the name of the
monkey-god children pipe up and say
Hanuman what was Rama&#39;s sister I mean
Rama&#39;s wife called Sita comes up
immediately I turn around and ask them
what was Jesus&#39;s mother
called Mary how did Jesus die he was
nailed on a cross then I asked him what
is the name of the prophets mother blank
absolute silence and at that point there
was this writer in me again the
storyteller in me who said there is a
lacuna that needs to be filled and I am
going to try and fill it and the thing
was the Quran has always been seen as a
book that people don&#39;t want to talk
about now I&#39;m not an expert on Islamic
Studies but I do like everybody else
like reading parables and you do see
parables in all books so I thought what
I would do was look at the Islamic law
and work out a book which would allow
children and people several of us here
in this room who do not know anything
about what are the contents of the Quran
understand some things some elements so
that we know that there is absolutely
nothing that preaches violence and
hatred in the Quran just like any other
tenet of any other religion whether it
is Judaism or Buddhism Hinduism
Christianity whatever the Quran - is a
book that preaches peace and love and so
was born my children&#39;s book called Musa
and baby John stories from the Quran at
the end of it all when I look back and I
asked myself why do I write I just have
one reason why I write to lead from
ignorance to the beginnings of knowledge
from prejudice to a better understanding
and to reaffirm in these times wreaked
with discrimination and terror that
there is still hope that we need to be
as much humane as we are human nothing
else matters nothing else is of
consequence thank you
you
