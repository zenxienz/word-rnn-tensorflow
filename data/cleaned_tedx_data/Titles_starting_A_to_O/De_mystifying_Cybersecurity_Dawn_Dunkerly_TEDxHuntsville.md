so what I would like to talk to you
about today is demystifying site so I&#39;m
the chief of cyber operations at Army
Materiel Command out on Redstone Arsenal
and these issues every day probably a
lot of folks don&#39;t see anything or hear
anything about it until they turn on the
news and see something about hacking or
breaches or all these things that we&#39;re
dealing with on a daily basis home and
and so folks say okay I&#39;m not important
enough to have an attacker come after me
or you know I don&#39;t have anything that&#39;s
valuable to them anyway and what I want
to disabuse you of is that notion you
are important and you do have things you
have access to your job you have access
to your bank account you have access to
the ability to be a cog in the larger
wheel that might be a botnet and so what
I would like to quickly impart upon you
today all right set of analogies some
security behaviors to help you
understand why what you&#39;re doing is no
different than any other good security
behavior you might have the theme of
this this conference is transformation
so I would like to leave you with some
transform thoughts about your importance
in the realm of cyber security social
security behaviors so you do things on a
daily basis that are peers whether you
realize it or not you don&#39;t go out of
your house that&#39;s likely without locking
your door you don&#39;t go down a dark alley
without thinking about whether you
should be there so we impart these
security behaviors on our on our daily
lives without necessarily thinking about
them whether common-sense why would an
attacker go down your chimney to gain
access to your house if you leave your
front door
I&#39;d open yet in many cases and we&#39;re
going to talk about some of these in
many cases we leave the front door wide
open all the time and simply don&#39;t think
about it because that cyber stuff is
super weird so the hit from the first
slide cyber is actually the less
important word in cybersecurity security
good security behaviors so I&#39;m gonna
give you a set of analogies for you to
ponder over passwords so we all have to
deal with passwords on a daily basis
sometimes at work sometimes at home we
have a variety of social media accounts
we have email we have all these things
and passwords are irritating they really
are and they&#39;re getting longer and
they&#39;re getting more complex and
websites are forcing us to do things but
let me leave something with you
passwords are like the lock on your
house they&#39;re like your bank account
they&#39;re like the walk on your shed and
you want that lot to be strong but let
me leave you with this why would you use
the same lock on your house that you use
on your shed it use on your your bank
you want different locks and you want
different levels of security so think
about your password like it&#39;s a lock and
you want different locks so don&#39;t use
the same password for all of those
things super easy super simple and will
save you a lot of trouble
patching so the picture here is of you
know razor wire and barbed wire and
security cameras there&#39;s probably some
security guards roaming around
so think about cyber security very much
as a layered defense you have layers you
have crown you have the basic stuff like
simple fences you have locks you have
security cameras patching your system
might be one of the easiest things you
do sometimes irritating zan under the
middle of a
you know FaceTime or you&#39;re in the
middle of an important email or playing
a video game and pops up and says we
need to restart your system of hyzers or
critical patch needs to be applied and
it&#39;s super easy to say ignore and then
you ignore and then you ignore and
months SMI and you haven&#39;t patched your
system patches are not put out by your
operating system provider but your
software provider for nothing
these are fixing vulnerabilities that an
attacker can use to gain access to your
system gain access to your information
so think about a way or defense in this
way this is a most basic defense a
simple defense go ahead and click that
you know it&#39;s all and restart now save
yourself a lot of trouble in the end
fishing so for those of you who may not
be as aware of phishing phishing often
occurs through email often someone
emails young blue with an attachment or
a link sometimes even someone you know a
friend or a family member
hey open this out take a look at it hey
click this link I found this really cool
side I want you to check out but what it
really is going to do is gonna redirect
you to something where it&#39;s going to
download something to your system it
might make you a cog in a larger wheel
of a botnet or an attack was going to
take place pitching very often ends up
with you losing information thank you
count information passwords and
usernames install something on your
system so here we have a dark alley
you&#39;re walking on the street alone
minding your business you come to this
dark alley it looks ominous you probably
think twice about walking down that
alley that&#39;s a little safe probably
shouldn&#39;t do that but a lot of folks an
unbelievable amount of holes will click
that email and open it up open an
attachment up click that link and think
nothing of it so what I would encourage
you to do the next time you
you know even from somebody you know and
you&#39;re not expecting it and has an
attachment or I had a link maybe ask
them yeah did you send this to me did
you have something I was expecting that
I just wanted to check that simple act
can save you from again losing all of
your information or possibly being a
part of a larger botnet it can attack or
harm other people and finally my
favorite social media we love our social
media these days Facebook Twitter all
these things Instagram sharing with
people sharing the the things that we&#39;re
doing in our lives sharing about kids
and our family understand I would tell
you though then the ology here is a club
night club you walk into the night club
you want to meet people you want to have
a few drinks you know sit some time with
friends you would not go into that night
club and tell everybody there hey guys
I&#39;m going to be out of the country for
the next two weeks on vacation or hey
guys you know here&#39;s all about my
personal life here&#39;s where I&#39;m at here&#39;s
what I&#39;m doing here&#39;s what I do for a
living I work at this place so why don&#39;t
we do it on social media because I&#39;ll
tell ya I&#39;m guaranteed the by some sort
of you haven&#39;t look at your privacy
setting clinically and you&#39;re wide open
to everyone so go back to their original
statement I mean I&#39;m not important I
want my information absolutely they
would breaking in your house breaking in
your bank account it&#39;s talking to your
kids it&#39;s all happened so think about
that the next time you post on social
media where you&#39;re going to be or what
you do or something about work
furthermore I would really encourage all
of you to go tonight check your privacy
settings maybe limit the scope of the
information that&#39;s shared limit it to
people you actually know or keep it
private you know your birthday that&#39;s a
nice thing for people to know
except for it is also very often a
password hint to gain access to your
passwords on websites think about that
so in closing what I will tell you think
about your security behaviors the simple
things that you do on your in your daily
life you wouldn&#39;t walk down a street in
the dark alone no lights so why don&#39;t we
continue to behave these ways transform
your behavior and be a part of the
solution and not a part of the problem
thank you
[Applause]
