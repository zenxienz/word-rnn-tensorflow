um good afternoon everyone my name is
Alexandra
and I confess I have borrowed or stolen
the title of my speech from the great
Tina Turner
so it&#39;s fighting racism what&#39;s love got
to do with it so when we think of the
history of the world and humankind we
come across phenomenon that are so
closely linked to human suffering and
that are there with us since agents
since forever so these are Wars war
crimes genocide crimes against humanity
hunger cruel treatment of humans by
humans torture and also racism becomes
one of this phenomenon racism and one of
its particular forms which is
anti-semitism that is being called the
longest hatred and some ten years ago I
decided to combine my legal expertise to
combine my education and my passion for
Human Rights and to start fighting
against racism with the tools of law I
guess any talk on braving the impossible
shouldn&#39;t start with a depressing or
discouraging statement but unfortunately
here it is racism anti-semitism
xenophobia will never be defeated or
eliminated fully the fight against them
is more like Don Quixote fight against
windmills so you can only try but I
would like to tell you today why I still
believe this is the fight worth taking
all efforts and commitment for me it all
started when I first met professor Alvin
Rosenfeld a world-class expert in
Holocaust literature at one of the
academic conferences and he said that
when he looked at me and he listened to
me he saw a deep compassion for the Jews
that perished during the Holocaust and a
sense of core responsibility for what
had happened to them and this was true I
have always felt this way but it just
struck me that someone else could also
notice this
and some months later I attended the
lecture given by a Harvard professor
root visa and the lecture was entitled
what are we going to do with
anti-semitism no seriously what and the
way professor visa spoke about fighting
anti-semitism how passionate she was
about it was so enlightening and
inspiring for me in so many regards and
today I&#39;m sure that both professor
visioned professor Rosa Rosenfeld
inspired me and gave me courage to turn
the inner sorrow and pain that I truly
felt into action against the evil that
caused his feelings and so I decided to
combine this growing urge to do
something about it to do something about
anti-semitism racism with my legal
background and since then I have been
trying to break the impossible but now
comes the controversial part that
everyone is waiting for the law doesn&#39;t
work I mean the law doesn&#39;t work the way
it should when it comes to the phenomena
that are so closely linked to human
feelings because you can force someone
to stop stealing with the tools of law
but you are not able to stop someone
from hating another person because of
that person&#39;s color of the skin religion
or national or ethnic origin this is
much more complicated and demanding but
we shouldn&#39;t give up I truly believe in
the social responsibility of law and if
we agree that the system of legal norms
and in particularly this part of the
system that belongs to the body of
criminal law has been established as a
kind of demarcation line between this
what is acceptable and this what is not
acceptable and condemned in a given
society or community then I argued that
racism should be punished and condemned
on an equal footing as stealing reckless
driving or or fraud
what is more I perceive racism as much
more socially harmful than many other
crimes that are traditionally being
included in criminal codes
second I think that there must be limits
to free speech no genocide in the modern
history of the world would have been
possible without being preceded by
hateful words and of course Nazi
anti-semitic propaganda is just a
classic well-known example here but they
also think about Rwanda about genocide
and war crimes that took place during
Balkan war where the hatred has been
there has been spread for years before
the actual killing started I also negate
the concept of free marketplace of ideas
were all are free to express themselves
freely even the most hateful manner and
their ideas compete in a way and the
winning idea is the one that gains the
largest support of the listeners I
simply don&#39;t believe that haters in this
case racists and their victims are
equals in this kind of competition all
research results clearly proof that
those targeted by hateful speech racist
hateful speech are more likely to stay
quiet to suffer in silence just in order
to avoid further attacks they are
vulnerable they don&#39;t fight back and
this is crucially important to help them
so for me racism anti-semitism
xenophobia Islamophobia homophobia these
are not ideas or views they are all
hatred and I don&#39;t discuss with haters
third facing and fighting racism demands
being radical sometimes as Elie Wiesel a
great writer and Holocaust survivor and
the peace Nobel Prize winner said we
must take sides neutrality helps the
oppressor never the victim and you can&#39;t
compromise here so you are not on good
terms with colleagues who claim that
upper tide headed good side - and you
don&#39;t perceive Holocaust denial it&#39;s
just another opinion of someone who
claims that the Jews invented the great
lie of gas chambers and you don&#39;t laugh
at
even slightly racist jokes and you get
out of a taxi
even if already very late for work if a
driver makes taxi driver makes a
homophobic remark and then immediately
you call the taxi company to complain
it seems obvious and easy but it&#39;s not
it&#39;s demanding it&#39;s even stressful
because you need to be constantly aware
and constantly ready and willing to
fight back to respond but it&#39;s worth the
effort really it is so maybe something
positive now so what are the benefits of
fighting racism I&#39;m a lawyer and in line
with all unfair exaggerated stereotypes
associated with this profession I&#39;m
really interested in gaining as much as
possible and winning the cases so what
do we gain by fighting racism I will
claim that we gain actually everything
that really matters because first we
help the victims of human rights
violations second we prove that human
solidarity really exists and third maybe
most importantly we protect ourselves
and the societies we live in from the
keynesian plaque of hatred that poisons
Souls hearts and minds and by standing
firm against racism we also respond to
the powerful call of never again that
referred to the Holocaust but has never
been fulfilled and so we are saving the
world I know it sounds pretentious but I
really believe it&#39;s true so if I were to
advise anyone on how to try because it&#39;s
just possible to try to brave the
impossible in case of fighting racism
this is what I would list as the most
important things first
be aware know the history and know
current developments so this way you
will be able to fight racism not only
because you feel it&#39;s right to do so but
also because you will know how
devastating its consequences are its
social moral legal consequences our
second be careful with those who
I&#39;m definitely not a racist not a
homophobe not an anti-semite god forbid
but there is no place for commas here
just a full stop I&#39;m not a racist full
stop then react always react to quote
Elie Wiesel once again indifference is
the epitome of evil and this is very
simple just imagine for a second you are
a target of hatred just because the
color of your skin and there is
absolutely no one to stand by your side
to help you
this just demands human action I think
we all burn this moral obligation to act
and help in such situations and for me
this obligation just doubles or triples
even for lawyers then know the law and
how and when to use it we tend to think
that legal actions legal steps are
reserved for true or serious crimes only
but at least in the European system of
human rights protections there are laws
against hate speech racist hate speech
racist hate crimes so in the situation
that someone disseminates in public
booklets with the theories of the hero
he of racists or pictures ethnic
minorities as subhumans the law demands
action then be engaged know that there
are hundreds of NGOs wonderful NGOs
acting against racism try to help them
maybe just by signing their petitions it
really means a lot it&#39;s crucial and
lastly become passionate I more and more
often come to the conclusion that what
really matters is compassion and if you
will feel this way towards another
person towards the victim of human
rights violations then you will never be
hesitating to act thank you very much
[Applause]
