right just five short weekends ago
hurricane Harvey hit and devastated our
community I know that Josh already asked
us but if you don&#39;t mind me asking how
many of you maybe were flooded or know
someone personally that was everyone in
this room right I know things are still
pretty raw around here and I can
actually relate to that
during Harvey my mom lost everything so
she&#39;s been staying with us and a lot of
our friends we&#39;ve been trying to help
them recover as well but before that we
grew up along the Gulf Coast and in 2005
Hurricane Rita hit our our home town and
we lost everything and then just as we
were moving back in in 2008 in Hurricane
Ike a ten foot storm surge hit and
completely washed out my hometown again
and so Ike was particularly scary for me
because my dad wasn&#39;t able to evacuate
and he had to climb up into the attic to
escape that ten-foot storm surge that
just went straight through our our home
so even though we lost possessions
photos childhood memories I still
counted us as fortunate because we all
made it out alive and then a few years
later I went to this is my hometown over
95 percent of the structures were
uninhabitable so the entire community
was gone and then a few years later I
went to Haiti after the earthquake to
help clean up rubble but while we were
there there was this devastating flash
flood event that happened and there was
no warning about it on the ground and so
a lot of the tent communities that we
visited were completely devastated and
cholera spread in record numbers and so
these events had a really profound
effect on me and it led me to want to
study this as my life mission so I
became a civil engineer in the field of
hydrology and as a civil engineer we get
to study flood models and then design
drainage infrastructure to mitigate for
the
floods up to a certain risk level for
example the National floodplain boundary
is based on a 100-year storm now this
doesn&#39;t mean that we won&#39;t have another
one of these storms for 100 years it&#39;s
really a one in 100 chance of getting
that amount of rainfall in any given
year irrespective of past or future
storms
so when hurricane Harvey hit this was
completely off the charts of our
statistical probability hurricane Harvey
dumped about 50 inches of rainfall in
just four days which is about a year&#39;s
worth of rainfall for the Gulf Coast
region so in that type of event flooding
is to be expected and during such a
large catastrophe I was expecting to see
people with just sheer and utter panic
and this was kind of a stressful time in
our nation and community it felt like
things were on the verge of fracturing
but instead people just stopped what
they were doing and came together people
from all walks of life helped shelter
each other
rebuild sustain each other and just
bring general hope and a lot of this had
to do with the power of social media so
social media has been used in the past
to completely revolutionize the
humanitarian industry a prime example of
this is after the Haiti earthquake which
happened in 2010 and this was around the
time where smart technology and mobile
phones really started spreading around
the world and when the earthquake hit
less than 50 percent of the country was
mapped at all so eight agencies they
didn&#39;t know where to send the resources
so what happened was this massive
crowdsourcing effort where people could
send in their texts and their tweets and
their photographs and this information
was the most comprehensive crisis map
available was created with this
information and this wasn&#39;t done by
government or private institution this
was just the power of the people banding
together and sharing what they knew to
meet a common need and you guys actually
did this to us
Harvie there are a lot of crowd sourcing
platforms that popped up after the storm
where people were able to ping whether
or not their streets were flooded which
this is really useful to first
responders or they could send in
information about where they needed
supplies sent or in shelters had
capacity and this was really useful to
eight agencies but the thing is a lot of
people maybe didn&#39;t know that these
platforms existed so as The Times
recently published people kind of turned
to Twitter and Facebook as de facto
emergency hotlines
hurricane Harvey became the first social
media storm in the United States and I
can attest to this because going through
hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 compared to
now there was a world of difference with
how we responded to these storms as a
community I saw a post after post after
post of people saying they needed
rescued or their family members needed
rescued off of countertops and tabletops
and people would share and within hours
these people were actually getting
rescued my husband and I even used a
social media app called Zelo to get in
touch with the Cajun Navy and we were
able to help out with their relief
efforts and this is a form of
crowdsourcing because people would send
in the address where they needed
rescuing
and then these maps were updated in
real-time and sent to the rescue boats
so can you imagine maybe the results we
might have had with all of these people
stranded if we didn&#39;t have this type of
technology so yes social media and
crowdsourcing has been used to respond
to natural disasters but I want to
propose another challenge what if we
could use the same principle and
technology instead to help predict the
flood before it occurs so how might we
do that you ask well as a floodwater
engineer the most important thing to our
models is widespread and accurate data
so typically what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll
collect a different a lot of different
data sets from satellite imagery or from
survey information such as how much
vegetation we have and what the
elevation of the land is and then we can
create predictive models
now even with the best math and the best
data these are still based on
mathematical theories so what we have to
do is we have to calibrate our models
with a known ground truth information so
you may have driven over bridges and
seen these stream gauges as you&#39;re going
over and this tells us how high the
water actually got in a given magnitude
rain event and we&#39;re able to calibrate
at that known point and then it helps us
update the parameters throughout the
rest of the watershed and this works
where we have stream gauges but in rural
areas like my hometown or in Haiti these
stream gauges might be spread out over
many miles or they might not exist at
all so in those instances what we&#39;ll do
as scientists is we&#39;ll take photographs
right after the storm of the high-water
mark and then we&#39;re able to use that
instead to calibrate our model at a
specific point and there are
institutions that are starting to
partner with the general public to
crowdsource that type of information did
you know that right now the National
Weather Service actually analyzes your
twitter feeds the ones that are made
public so if you post something with
hashtag flood or hashtag Harvey there&#39;s
a very real chance that someone&#39;s
looking at these photos and comparing it
to their prediction models and there
have been examples where the models
showed something slightly different and
they&#39;re able to update them with your
information and then this just makes the
models that much more accurate for the
next storm and there are other ways that
we crowd source hydrology if you just
really want to get gung-ho and excited
about science you can buy one of these
weather stations and put them on your
roof and this information is sent out to
the Weather Underground app which is a
really popular smart from weather
application and people from all over can
zoom in and look at what the weather is
happening on your own roof and this is
also sent to the National Weather
Service meteorologists and they use this
to complement their precipitation gage
data and then they update their forecast
with it and they disseminate that out to
all of us so there is still a ways to go
before we can really streamline this
type of data collection effort but the
more involvement that we have from the
in all public the better chances we have
of saving lives together so after
hurricane Harvey hit approximately one
in ten homes in Houston were flooded
before more than one in ten people are
part of the solution so I want to
encourage you to really start
understanding hydrology in your backyard
and then sharing that data that you know
and then being involved in disaster
response at a grassroots level thank you
