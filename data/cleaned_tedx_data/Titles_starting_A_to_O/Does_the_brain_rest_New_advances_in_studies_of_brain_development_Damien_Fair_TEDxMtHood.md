let&#39;s start off with some statistics one
in six children now have developmental
disability that&#39;s a 17% increase over
the last decade driven largely by
disorders like autism and ADHD if we&#39;re
going to reverse these trends need to
understand what&#39;s happening inside the
brain or how about this
42% of high school students who drive do
so while text texting or emailing 33
percent do so having drunk alcohol and
22% have used marijuana while driving a
general trend is that adolescents tend
to engage in more risky behaviors than
their adult counterparts and if you live
in the northwest you&#39;re very familiar
with this because we just had several
adolescents think that would be fun to
throw firecrackers into the Columbia
River Gorge which of course led to
devastating results so I repeat what in
the world is going on inside their brain
now what I&#39;m not going to do is answer
this question specifically but what I
can do is tell you some of the tools and
some of the advances over the last 10
years that have allowed us to tackle
these questions more rigorous rigorously
now my lab studies uses MRI to study the
brain a lot of people are familiar with
MRI from the hospital where we use
structural images like the one that you
see right here that&#39;s really important
for for examining structural damage in
the brain but my can be used for other
things as well like function in the
brain or activity in the brain over time
now if you&#39;ve read the newspaper seen
that in the popular press where you&#39;ve
seen these types of images this is what
you typically see we have some
investigator doing some type of task in
there leave by some type of control task
force app for example that I&#39;m in the
scanner will have them open their eyes
and close their eyes
then open their eyes and close their
eyes and open their eyes and close their
eyes we&#39;ll do it over and over and over
and over again do some type of averaging
of that signal and lo and behold we can
see the part of the brain that&#39;s more
active when your eyes are open relative
to when they&#39;re close
well some people ask well why is it that
we have to do this so many times and
make the average and the answer to that
is because the brain signals are
actually quite noisy okay so just like
we have to average a bunch of political
polls to get a sense of the true
political climate we have to average a
bunch of the MRI signals to get an
accurate estimate of where the activity
actually lies okay well back in 1995 a
man by the name of bribe is well decided
look at this noise a little more closely
and what he did is he put someone in the
scanner and had him do a typical task
just like we talked about before so he
had him going to scanner Nedim finger
tapping and then rest and then finger
tapping and then rest finger tapping the
rest over and over and over again and lo
and behold he could see parts of the
brain of a more active and tapping
versus rest and this is called the motor
cortex and then what he did is he took
one of those regions had the subjects go
back in the scanner and just sit there
and don&#39;t do anything off don&#39;t move
don&#39;t do anything just sit there and
rest it&#39;s like one of those brain
regions measured the noise and then
correlated that noise across all the
other boxes in the brain and what he
found was that the same brain regions
that were activated when you&#39;re moving
your fingers
we&#39;re also sitting there spontaneously
oscillating with each other at rest
while you&#39;re not doing anything at all
just sitting there so that told us is
that this signal in the brain when
you&#39;re not doing anything is actually
important it tells us how different
parts the brain are communicating in
this state now the first question that
often people ask is who cares
why does it matter while why does it
matter what the brain is doing when were
not actually doing anything probably one
of the best examples of why this is so
important comes from one of my mentors
and colleagues Marcus trickle who
describes this activity in terms of the
energy budget so from all that food you
ate in the last 24 hours
where does all that energy actually go
okay so this is a an image of resting
metabolism in the brain and we pointed
out a couple different parts of the body
and what you can see is that the brain
is highly highly metabolic relative to
other parts of the body like the liver
in the heart and the reason is is
because despite the brain only been 2%
of the body size it consumes about 20%
of its energy okay now how does that
energy change when the brain is actually
active and you&#39;re actually doing
something well let&#39;s look at that so
here&#39;s the MIT meta metabolic activity
at the brain at rest and here&#39;s what it
looks like when you&#39;re actually doing
something like viewing words or reading
and what you can see is that it doesn&#39;t
look like a whole lot is changing and
the reason is because the extra energy
consumption of the brain when you&#39;re
doing something is only a small portion
it&#39;s only less than 5% of the total and
the only reason that you can see those
fancy pictures in the New York Times or
the popular press is because we can take
a difference of those two images so do
we really only use 1 to 10% of our brain
like Hollywood would would make us
believe and the answer is no we use the
brain is highly active at a very high
rate nearly all of the time ok now what
is this stuff important for and so it&#39;s
hard to often emphasize how important
this activity is but there is one
example that usually kind of sticks for
people why this activity in the
background is so important so it may
come to surprise to many of you that
from nearly the unlimited amount of
information that exists in your visual
world
only about ten to the ten bits per
second actually reach your I of the back
via retina that&#39;s about the same
resolution of your blu-ray DVD by the
time that information gets back to the
next stop what we call the thalamus the
informations been degraded even more now
it&#39;s about six ten ten to the six bits
per second about what you can see on the
old-school standard definition TVs by
the time that information gets back to
the visual cortex we&#39;re down to 10 to
the fourth bits per second or what the
kind of resolution see and a videophone
or what Wikipedia likes to call the
minimum necessary for consumer
acceptable talking head picture using
various video compression schemes okay
how the about the amount of information
that you&#39;re actually aware of
consciously aware of it&#39;s about eight
hundred bits per second and there&#39;s no
more not enough information even show
video this would be what you&#39;d have on
your voice over IP or audio on your cell
phone so of course the question is well
how does the brain make sense of such
impoverished data and provide us with a
visual experience for the world that
some people say is even better than
blu-ray DVD and the answer is it&#39;s this
spontaneous activity that&#39;s happening in
the background
it&#39;s filling all the gaps in fact the
reason why magicians have jobs is they
can take advantage of this property of
the brain and trick us into believing
something exists that actually doesn&#39;t
ok so Wow as the famous William James
once said well as part of what we
perceive comes from our senses of the
object before us another part and
probably a larger part comes directly
out of our own head so you can see of
how this information has such a big
impact on our perceptions and behavior
on why we think it&#39;s important to use to
study mental health disorders and to
study risky behavior in adolescent
populations but there&#39;s a problem
the brain is billions and billions and
billions of neurons that are tightly
connected intricately across all those
all those neurons and so as neuro
scientists have to figure out a way to
condense information that&#39;s something
that&#39;s simple enough to actually
analyze okay so we do this through a
mathematical discipline called graph
theory well what is graph theory well
graph theory is all about the study of
networks where networks are simply
collections of nodes so nodes can be
anything from people to cities to web
pages that are linked by lines or edges
so that would be roads between cities
links between webpages or friends
between people right now graph tree has
been used to study all types of systems
from networks and Internet to us
commuting patterns to interactions of
committees and subcommittees in Congress
assuming of course everything&#39;s running
properly to enter protein-protein
interactions in webs one celled
organisms like East and what you can see
from all these images right is it&#39;s not
simply a connects to B connects to C
right and it&#39;s also not random there&#39;s
clearly some structure in here so
gravity does well how do we quantify
these patterns and what do they actually
mean to the function of the system so
there&#39;s some very simple measures like
degree so some some parts of the brain
have lots of connections meaning they
have high degree some parts of the brain
have few connections meaning they have
low degree there&#39;s other measures like
path link so if I want to get
information from the node and the left
to the node on the right I have to go
over one two three jumps to the path
link between these two guys is three but
two other some more complex measurements
as well I&#39;d say be abhor community
structure or we have various algorithms
that are trying to identify nodes that
are tightly clustered and connected
relative to other nodes the idea of
these systems is try to maximize the
number of inter community edges is
relative to the inter community edges
over the last decade we&#39;ve been using
the combination of these tools to tell
us something about how the brain is
organized and there&#39;s been some very
important findings where we&#39;ve now
identified approximately 10 to 15
different systems
in the brain that have various types of
functions related to our everyday
behavior so for example the frontal
parietal Network that we&#39;re showing here
in yellow is really important for
moment-to-moment attention and things
like working memory our ability to hold
in mind phone numbers to be able to
manipulate it in any given time we have
systems like what we call the singular a
particular network this system is really
important for sustained attention or
holding in rules so for example the
reason why there&#39;s nobody has at least
yet screamed at me and yelled out liar
is because you know the context of this
environment you know the rules of the
engagement and you&#39;re at some some part
of the brain is holding that information
in a mine and this system is one of the
systems that&#39;s actually doing that you
have other systems like the default
system that&#39;s important for internal
mentation and planning rumination things
of that nature and other networks as
well now so you might imagine that these
kind of behaviors might be related to
risky decision-making and mental health
problems and this is why scientists in
these days are so interested in studying
these phenomena now the work has gone
further where a group our colleagues at
Washington University have done really
an excellent job to show that we can
examine these types of systems not
simply at the group or population level
anymore but also very very intricately
at each and every one of you ok
something that Oscar Miranda dominguez
from my laboratory has coined a
functional fingerprint of the brain ok
but we can also do other things like we
can measure the effect of drugs so but
not only just the bad stuff but some of
the not so bad stuff as well like did
you have your coffee this morning
or not
in fact these data themselves are
conducted on one of our mad Sciences
Russ pull Drac who decided to do this
test it&#39;s very experiment on himself
okay but if you could we can do this it
begs the question well can we also test
other types of interventions on the
brain in certain types of mental health
disorders or in the case of risky
decision making we believe that answer
is yes so here&#39;s an example of the of
the brain in a in a in a group of young
adults of putting a circle around the
that single ER per clue that network
that&#39;s really important for holding in
rules okay
here&#39;s what that here&#39;s what that system
looks like in a peer matched group in
folks that have ADHD and what you can
see it appears to be almost completely
gone okay now when we put these
participants on back under stimulants
I&#39;m gonna see the system comes back to
life and so you can see you can start to
tend to see our excitement about our
ability to test other types of
behavioral medicinal therapies for
various types of mental health problems
but we don&#39;t have to do the work only
when the problem occurs but we can go
much much earlier in fact this is a
picture of my daughter just a few days
old and this is about the age that we
can start collecting these data or these
measurements and follow them through
childhood through adolescence and beyond
so what is happening in the brain of my
child who has ADHD or why is my
adolescent engaging so often in risky
behaviors well we can&#39;t definitively
answer those questions yet but these are
the types of tools that neuroscientists
are using today to be able to tackle
these different difficult questions but
we need your help so we&#39;re currently in
the process of scanning 10,000 children
across the United States from childhood
through adolescence visit to visit the
website learn about these studies and if
you&#39;re in the catchment area and
eligible we&#39;d love to have you
participate visit brain facts org learn
about other similar topics like this
get education materials ask questions
that give us feedback about how US
neuroscience are actually communicating
our ideas and of course if you&#39;re
interested in our outreach efforts or
you have other youth that you think
might be interested in this type of work
visit our visit our websites related to
our outreach we we think that the work
that we&#39;re that&#39;s being done here is
only as powerful as that our ability to
bring up the next generation of
scientists so I&#39;ll end there and thank
you
