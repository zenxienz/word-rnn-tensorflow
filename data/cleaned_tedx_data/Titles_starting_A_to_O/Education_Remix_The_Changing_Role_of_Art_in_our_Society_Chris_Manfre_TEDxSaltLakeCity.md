I have these two friends and they are
perfect for each other my one friend
she&#39;s so authentic has a way of
connecting with people deeply my other
friend it&#39;s one of the smartest guys I
know he&#39;s always helping other people I
found out that she knew each other in
the past he said this wasn&#39;t sure if she
was ready to take things to the next
level but he doesn&#39;t know that she has
really changed lately I couldn&#39;t help to
notice that the timing was perfect for
them actually came across their dating
profiles and found out that they&#39;re
indeed a great match with a high
percentage of compatibility here&#39;s my
win French profile her current interests
include graphic and game design virtual
and augmented reality 3d illustration
and animation her real name art here&#39;s
my other friends profile his current
interests include medicine research
anatomy and physiology you might be able
to guess his real name science they look
so different how could they be a good
match could it simply be their
differences that make them a good match
I mean is it too simple to suggest that
sometimes science is hard to understand
and that art can use more of a role in
helping people learn I like what Michele
goes you says about this she says that
art and science are partners in the
human journey and like partners in a
good marriage or successful business
they often have separate projects but
they collaborate when it serves them
because their relationship is intimate
and nourishing and without the
participation of them both the journey
is not as successful nor interesting nor
is deep now of course we know this isn&#39;t
a new idea but I believe that the role
of art is changing in our society due to
new technologies and that the
convergence of science and art can be
more powerful today than ever before in
education as a kid growing up in the 80s
I was inspired by the weirdest things
when you think of your childhood what
inspired you what images come to mind
maybe for some of you it&#39;s Neil
Armstrong standing on the moon maybe for
others it&#39;s Michael Jordan flying across
the basketball court
anyone else spend a little bit too much
time thinking about Casio keyboard sound
effects Garbage Pail Kids or Trapper
Keeper cover art somehow these strange
art forms inspired me to be creative and
being creative in making the weirdest
things possible was all I wanted to do
when I grew up as a teenager I realized
how design would influence what I would
buy and what I would wear my dad a truck
driver from Brooklyn who attended
Woodstock would take me to the mall in
eighth grade to buy mustard colored
pants a braided belt in a polkadot
rancher inspired by MC Hammer videos on
MTV realizing that design is a powerful
tool that connects people to people
through visual ideas eventually led me
to become a graphic designer
and today I focus on 3d illustration
animation and game design programming
I&#39;ve also had a chance to share this
passion as a teacher at a Salt Lake City
youth media organization called spy hub
as a designer I&#39;ve had a chance to work
on various freelance projects and two of
these projects changed my perspective on
design completely one of them creating a
3d animation of the LASIK eye surgery
procedure and the other programming and
animating a prototype of a hearing app
that shows how the cochlea processes
sounds and through these projects I&#39;ve
realized something so amazing we can use
the power of design to help people learn
science and that made me think when we
cut funding to our arts programs we&#39;re
kind of a valuable tool
doctors scientists and educators from
telling the visual story of science
physicist Isadora Isaak Robbie says as
yet if a man has no feeling for art he&#39;s
considered narrow-minded he has no
feeling for science this is quite normal
this is a fundamental weakness I became
so excited about this idea of using
design to help people learn science I
decided to return to school and find a
way to study these subjects together but
I didn&#39;t have much luck even though
there&#39;s a handful of programs across the
country none of them were accessible to
me and the more I looked into it and
spoke with other people about it the
more I started to think that there&#39;s a
little bit of an awkwardness between
these two subjects and in my mind that&#39;s
when I started to think that our in
science are like two singles hanging out
at a dance standing awkwardly and by the
punch bowl in the gymnasium not knowing
what to say to each other even though
they&#39;re a really good match well I
eventually found out you could create a
custom major at Westminster College in
Salt Lake City Utah so I created the
custom major biomedical communication
and design now started about a year ago
and I was so excited and ready to learn
about anatomy and physiology and I was
falling behind quickly and I realized
that learning science is really hard
I found watching online science
animations was the one thing that was
helping me grasp the concepts but a lot
of times with science I was trying to
learn one simple concept and learning
one concept this way was starting to
feel a little bit clunky and I&#39;m tempted
to say old school I mean you have to
open your browser search online for
videos once you find the video scrub
past the intro find the one concept that
you&#39;re trying to learn and then rewind
to that part over and over again until
you grasp the concept and what if
there&#39;s a better way I mean what if we
could just look at a science concept and
see an animation or better yet a
hologram using augmented reality
augmented reality places the digital
world into the real world what if we
took this concept and started to create
short and concise Twitter style 3d
animations that loop over and over again
as you grasp the concept one method of
using augmented reality does have a
picture that&#39;s associated with some kind
of 3d model or an animation and when you
look at that picture with an app on your
phone or some augmented reality glasses
it loads up the animation so I started
experimenting with this idea a first
place the science concept onto a piece
of paper this could be a worksheet that
a teacher hands out
or maybe something you get at the
doctor&#39;s office and you could begin to
interact with these holograms using
touchscreen technology and then I
started to think what if we could take
the same concept and save paper and use
a digital format that a lot of people
already use maybe Instagram or Twitter
as a way of organizing and updating
pictures you could have an entire
Instagram account dedicated to the
cardiovascular system or the nervous
system I think these concepts could be
much more effective
looking through glasses instead of a
tablet or a phone and as companies like
Apple seem to be moving closer to
creating some kind of consumer ready
augmented reality glasses as a design
teacher I can&#39;t wait until we can go
from sitting in a classroom like this to
collaborating more like this recently I
had a chance to borrow something called
the hololens which is basically some
fancy augmented reality glasses now I
wouldn&#39;t suggest wearing these and
asking someone to the enchantment under
the sea dance however if they say yes
you found your soul mate run to the
altar before you take it off so I
started thinking how else can we use
this technology to experience science
and create deeper understanding and
accelerated learning so I started
experimenting with some ideas I recorded
what I was seeing through the lens while
someone else was recording me I was so
exciting just to see a hologram floating
in my living room right away it was
exciting just exploring the digital
elements that now existed in the natural
environment and I started experimenting
with ways of interacting with the object
since my hands were free and placing the
objects around the room I experimented
with clicking on buttons and playing
animations I was also able to actually
reach out into the air and grab a
hologram and pull it closer to me and
programs speech recognition to say
something like rotate or stop they also
decided to have a little bit of fun with
the speech recognition do something kind
of weird
it&#39;s for this
next
I also wanted to explore going from
macro anatomy to micro anatomy in a
linear way that makes sense and since I
was having such a good time with these
Holograms I decided to take one out to
my front yard and see what it looked
like in the sunlight these technologies
were created using game design software
and as we move into the future where we
interact with the digital world inside
of the real world will we essentially be
living working and learning inside of a
video game and if so what could be a
future role of game designers is it
possible they could be working at
insurance companies banks maybe even the
grocery store we are at the forefront of
an exciting new era of understanding and
learning and as the Information Age gave
us access to unlimited information I
can&#39;t help but wonder how we will
remember more of the information by
experiencing it in the experience age
now more than ever the convergence of
science and art can help patients
medical students and our loved ones that
are sick understand and relate to
science like never before so let&#39;s get
these two lovebirds to dance and create
a brave new world where doctors and
designers high-five in hospital hallways
and scientists sing sweet songs grooving
with game designers gripping guitar hero
in order that we can build relationships
and work together to tell the powerful
and beautiful visual story of science in
ways never imagined thank you
