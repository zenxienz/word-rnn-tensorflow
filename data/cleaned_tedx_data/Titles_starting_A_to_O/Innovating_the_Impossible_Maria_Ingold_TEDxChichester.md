I am the daughter of a rocket scientist
born near where they dropped us of the
atom bomb some would say that explains a
lot because just over 30 years ago I was
the first person at the University of
New Mexico to study both computer
science and fine art yes that is art and
technology at the same time I&#39;ve now
worked in visual technology for just
over 25 years I started as a programmer
in games and video technology and ended
up as a chief technology officer as CTO
for Disney Sony joint venture I built
one of the most successful video
on-demand movie services in Europe now I
consult an innovative visual technology
I&#39;m also about to judge that&#39;s the
British Oscars a speaker a writer
occasionally an actress and I have a
thing for power tools I&#39;ve done
everything I&#39;ve done because I was
inspired for my father my father has a
way of looking at things
it makes the impossible possible that is
a genuine rocket scientist he has over
50 years of practical experience he
worked on Apollo 13 he increased the
accuracy of the guidance system for the
lunar excursion module from the 200
miles to 30 miles that helps save the
lives of the astronauts
he also speaks seven languages six
fluently built her off-grid happened by
hand back when silver was hippie and not
him and he collects and restores antique
cars 17 of them writes poetry and draws
feet to thank his second-grade teacher
said he&#39;d never amount to anything
where do you get a rocket scientist for
Father&#39;s Day yep one who&#39;s that into
maybe cars and solar tubes
yes I entry 7 Elon Musk I introduced
them because we share a passion for
innovating not just rocketry but
everything dad always said learn
everything about everything because he
always used everything he ever learned
that&#39;s how in his late 70s actually
retired and then was brought back as a
consulting rocket scientist he was able
to increase the accuracy of a specific
rocket component by one thousand four
hundred percent using a printout a ruler
and a calculator we live in an age now
where our smartphones are more powerful
than the computer that took us to the
moon yeah many people struggle to make
this kind of innovatively that&#39;s because
they&#39;re thinking in a single dimension
after having innovated in visual
technology now for 25 years I think we
need to cultivate a culture that goes
beyond a single dimension of innovation
we need to create a culture that allows
us to innovate in multiple dimensions
not only if we&#39;re going to create a
successful future but in order to
survive let me give you an explanation
most people have heard of
Elon Musk each of Ellen&#39;s companies has
advanced each of its industries by
innovating vertically so reusable
rockets battery-powered cars people
actually want to drive sleek solar tiles
and battery storage for use in home and
business and now hurricane hit islands
open source artificial intelligence
cybernetic interfaces between a human
mind and machine superfast travel and
tunneling that is finally aiming to be
faster than a snail all of these are
incredible achievements but it&#39;s
vertical innovation which leads to
evolution not revolution vertical
innovation is only the first step
because when you laterally innovate
across all these companies you get the
infrastructure you need for a Martian
colony the ability to travel to another
planet and back non-fossil place based
transport and power for a planet without
oil the ablator sees artificial
intelligence and neural interfaces to
communicate quickly in the hostile
environment of space an atmosphere of
Mars fast travel between sites and
tunneling to live underground in a high
radiation environment
see how lateral innovation changes
things revolution not just evolution
vertical innovation lateral of
innovation three-dimensional innovation
three-dimensional innovation is where we
use both sides of our brain and often
occurs at an unconscious level why
because using just half of our brain is
scientifically dumb and unconsciously we
can only process a few pieces of
information simultaneously whereas
consciously we can process millions
Thomas Edison made a conscious effort to
unconsciously innovate he wouldn&#39;t have
in an armchair with a ball bearing in
each hand as he fell asleep he would
drop the ball bearings onto the high
place the crash would wake him and he&#39;d
have write down his ideas dmitri
mendeleev
creators of the periodic table in a
dream he did extensive research on the
properties of the elements but he
couldn&#39;t identify the pattern I saw in a
dream a table where all elements fell
into place
as required awakening I immediately
wrote it down on a piece of paper not
only did he identify
where all of the elements would go but
he accurately predicted the existence of
missing elements Mendeleev wasn&#39;t just a
chemist he was also a physicist a
geologist and a meteorologist
Einstein was also a pianist and a
violinist he said the greatest
scientists are artists as well he would
innovate in feelings images music then
he would translate those ideas into
words logic and mathematics
my father he learned
anthropology geology chemistry
mathematics linguistics physics the
quantum mechanics and relativity he used
all of it in rocket science and when he
wanted to have a problem that was really
difficult he would think through it in
different languages which he visualized
as an image cloud learn everything about
everything because your unconscious mind
will take everything you learn and solve
problems that your conscious mind thinks
is impossible major advancements
creating the impossible comes from three
dimensional innovation yes there is a
fourth dimension time and only time will
tell how many impossible things one can
do innovation is diversity of thought so
why are we creating a culture in which
we have an education system and industry
that promotes a single dimension of
thought diversity has been shown to
provide three things within a company
better culture more innovation and a
higher return in equity and investment
so again why are we not encouraging
diversity of thoughts or otherwise
Harvey Mudd College in California only
offers a Bachelor of Science degree it&#39;s
graduates go on to make more money than
bachelors graduates from any other
American University including MIT
Harvard and Princeton it&#39;s also the most
expensive University in the u.s. it&#39;s
one of the highest ranked science
technology engineering and math or stem
colleges it&#39;s also one of the highest
ranked liberal arts colleges its
students study one-third of their
courses in core science one third in
their major and one-third in humanities
Social Sciences and the artists all
students also have to take a computer
science class whether that&#39;s one for
those who program before those who&#39;ve
never programmed to those who are
studying Biosciences introductory
computer science classes had such an
impact that over 50% of the computer
science graduates in 2016 who were
female far higher than the current
average of 16%
I studied computer science and fine art
over 30 years ago in the US now I live
in the UK 30 years later I still haven&#39;t
found a single UK university they will
let me study both computer science and
art at the same time even if they have
both colleges they all say letting
students choose what they want to study
is too complicated
unfortunately this thinking isn&#39;t just
limited to the UK remember Harvey Mudd
College graduates go on to make the most
money that means they are considered to
be the most valuable by industry so they
has a depth and breadth of expertise
what defines us as children is endless
curiosity and wonder and an unlimited
imagination curiosity leads to a desire
to learn wonder leads to passion and a
world without limits leads to
three-dimensional innovation a 16 year
old girl named Kavya Capital traded
iagnosed this a visual diagnostic tool
she was inspired because her grandfather
and he lives in India ended up with
diabetic retinopathy which can lead to
blindness she combined a smartphone app
with 3d printed lens and off-the-shelf
artificial intelligence which she
trained with tens of thousands of images
millions who would have gone blind
because they can&#39;t afford access to a
multi-thousand dollar retinal imager
will be able to get a diagnosis for the
smartphone photo what if a teacher had
told her she&#39;d never amount to anything
because she was choosing topics outside
the curriculum
I never would have studied two computer
scientists and become a chief technology
officer if I couldn&#39;t have also studied
art a few years ago I asked a group of
200 women here in the UK if they would
have gotten into technology earlier if
they could have studied to do all the
things that interested them at the same
time 200 women has raised their hands
what drives you is the passion what
enables you are tools like technology if
we want to get more kids interested in
STEM science technology engineering and
maths find out what drives their
curiosity and wonder give them tools
like technology but let them bring their
world without limits where they learn
everything about everything at the same
time innovate in three dimensions and
make the impossible happen
I&#39;ve soakin recently to several of the
world&#39;s most innovative corporations
they have all looked at my background
and asked are you product I&#39;m product
and technical and strategy and
innovation amongst other things
dad calls this bucketeering putting
people into buckets
pre defining and limiting the potential
of an individual bucket is hearing
simplifies the world to a single
dimension vertical buckets come from
fear a fear of failure a desire to be
safe when you put somebody in a bucket
they are definable manageable
replaceable simple and single
dimensional does not get us to Mars dad
and Elon both know that you&#39;re going to
blow up a few Rockets before you get
there yes three dimensional innovation
is more complex than one dimension but
Humanity is built to handle it children
are not afraid of multi-dimensional
thinking ours to accept our survival
requires innovation not playing it safe
an innovation comes from
depths of knowledge as well as breadth
of knowledge who do you want in your
company who would you want on Mars
somebody who must do something in a
bucket or someone who can solve problems
we&#39;ve never encountered before south
bucketeering
learn everything about everything and
make the impossible happen
thank you
