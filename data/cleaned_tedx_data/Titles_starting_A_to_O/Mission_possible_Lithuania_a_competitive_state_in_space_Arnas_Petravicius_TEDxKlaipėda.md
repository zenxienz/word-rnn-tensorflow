Lithuania a competitive state in space
just listen to those words and but it&#39;s
really so far away unreachable as we
think or is it only a constraint in our
mind because drill USA Germany China
Japan and etc occupied every bit of
Industry of space industry and there&#39;s
not even the point of trying joining the
club duh
it&#39;s a rocket science people tell me
when I have enough money people tell me
we don&#39;t have competence people tell me
and there is only one answer up for
people like that bullshit
that&#39;s totally bullshit I am 23 years
old economics and politics graduate who
refuses to believe that we as a nation
have any limits I refuse to believe that
something is destined not to be achieved
by us and I believe and I believe that
it&#39;s only a matter of perspective and
work ethics that keeps us from reaching
the Stars literally you don&#39;t have an
idea how many times to hurt words like
don&#39;t waste your time you&#39;re not a
scientist you&#39;re not one of us go and
manage something or bla bla bla but
those wonders of our universe those
wonders that I could talk for the rest
of the session right now or for the rest
of the day those questions that are not
answered about the existence and the
presence over all those questions won&#39;t
let me to listen to other people I need
answers and I just can&#39;t leave them
hanging so when I have one and a half
years ago I start digging start digging
so hard that even for garden economics
and politics student was a job
background in marketing and project
management I caught myself so deep in it
that it felt as being home it felt that
is my future that this is worth working
for that this is our future again people
ask me why does our future why we should
care about space when we have so much
problems down here why more reward we
should invest money into space
exploration and it&#39;s totally
understandable why people don&#39;t know why
they don&#39;t know that if not space
exploration who didn&#39;t have such
comfortable sleep every night because it
was NASA that developed memory foam they
don&#39;t know that space exploration gave
us harp on insulin pump and helped
millions of people&#39;s all around the
world they don&#39;t know that cordless
tools solar panels smoke detectors
workout machines and even firefighters
gear were developed or improved in a
need of space exploration and these are
only few examples of extraordinary
technical and scientific achievements
that we use every day and brings an
amazing economical advantage for the
providers and space is not the only
sphere that we need to be concerned
about science overall loses the interest
of the society they loses the interest
of young people and even our well-known
success cases laser industry feels
shortage of young people because they
are not interested in my opinion for
that reason the very first step that we
need to make in order to become a space
country is to let those people know why
and to introduce the science and
technology topic as the interesting as
it is we need to show that it&#39;s not only
boring paper writing or meaningless
functions we need to show them where it
leads and I can talk from my own
experience as a young guy that escaped
the educational system or least three
months ago but when the worst he was
fine well I wouldn&#39;t initial four years
of my life for anything else but school
possibly school maybe you know what&#39;s
after school because science education
is not what it&#39;s supposed to be it bored
me I hated physics a higher biology I
had merely tolerated math because no one
of them showed me what is the meaning of
it what is the outcome what tremendous
possibilities you can find they didn&#39;t
tell me that if you learn physics enough
later on that could lead me to
undisclosed discoveries and explorations
understanding now of course but then I
was only a girl&#39;s attention driven
teenage boy that thought about sports
more
his future and I really don&#39;t know the
right answer arild I know how the whole
educational system works but I believe
the children not only the process of
science but also the outcome and the
meaning of it would do so much more for
the kids well at least it would have
helped me the second step is really
related to the first one but I would
just want to highlight that the young
people that I&#39;m talking about
who can make a positive impact in the
future won&#39;t be able to do that positive
impact in the future if society in the
future won&#39;t let them to do that I think
we all know how public spending work
that politician tries to satisfy its own
electorate and blah blah blah so we need
to invest more into popularization of
science we need that median voter would
understand the benefits and meaning of
it and this case calls for action we
need to do something and there are some
projects going about that and for any
but of course it&#39;s not enough so this
moment my team and I will focus on the
long term actions how to implement the
popularization of science into everyday
life we now have some go on projects the
first one is the adult II support of the
spread the word about exciting exciting
and thrilling sight of the science and
you can find articles from space
exploration to culture do it ourselves
and etc we also have cosmonaut opus EJ a
monthly event in in Vilnius were space
enthusiasts gathered around listens to
virus lecturers and discuss some ideas
afterwards and we just had the launch of
second season and we see that a plant
grows new people come new faces come
they love to talk about science people
love to talk and listen about space so
in the near future we have two more
major milestones next year in October
are planning to have a space festival
based in Vilnius and discuss the
prospects of humankind on becoming
multiplanetary species and we&#39;ll discuss
it with stop specialists from space
agencies private entities and academia
and we also going to try to reach an
extraordinary goal to build
a Mars habitat in two days by our own
hands
second we want to start teaching our
scientists to communicate about science
we live in era where people like Neil
deGrasse Tyson or Bill Nye and others
are international superstars they&#39;re not
singers do not actors the not artists
but they are superstars and a lot of
kids chose to pursue science only
because decide that this is exciting and
thrilling from those personalities and
we need people like that in Lithuania
we need them to talk to society and show
that this is one world and science is
not a separate world of course talking
is never not enough we need to take more
actions and in my opinion the best way
for the trainer to move on is to create
a possibility to act and bring exact
nature in social sciences science is
closer together in cooperation we have
wonderful infrastructure in the strainer
that is not used enough as my very good
pal from science world once told me well
now we have new walls with old approach
and he&#39;s right nothing really changed so
we need a serious program that would
create possibilities to build new stuff
and commercialize them and most
importantly and tides hand simply for
people with ideas and great desires and
not tight money to academic or other
institutions in my opinion there are two
ways of doing that first we can take
example of Luxembourg where 300 million
euros are now waiting for companies that
are ready to mine asteroids in the
future so as well we could orange it
into an sphere devote some funding
devote some legal frameworks and attract
new companies we have some advanced
industries as lasers and biotechnology
that we could take advantage of but the
main question here is does the bottom
system works in Lithuania in my opinion
not so much so the second choice and my
favorite one is to make Lithuania a
hotspot of space startups and projects
by critic and
varmint that would attract hungry people
to building stuff right here we are
known as intrapreneur country not in the
region internationals well we have tons
of people who are ready to chase the
dreams we only need to show them that
space industry can be a place of
expression as well that&#39;s why we need a
serious conversation program that would
provide some kick off points for risker
projects and more importantly would
bring different specialization people
into one place because yes we still
think in Lithuania that managers are
worthless in science world and this
approach gives us far behind and it&#39;s it
just makes me sad because we had such
tremendous possibilities and the
potential and we just not used them
because we&#39;re good and R&amp;D but were a
hopeless at commercialization and
technology transfer so last year after
an amazing experience with the NASA
SpaceX and other major space players and
by seeing how they work and what he do
idea of Space Lab came up came alive in
my head an exterior kicking off Space
Lab in a full-strength bar were any
people would space industry based idea
can participate can receive a needed
infrastructure of charging funds and
network and most importantly all the
help from management side in order to
bring their ideas alive and
commercialize them and all in this way
we can start an engine and hope that
enough with enough efforts it will run
we already had one project enable swing
and lunar mission which aims was to
create an autonomous food-growing system
that would allow grow of fresh and
organic food independently in the most
harsh environment and in this case on
the moon we had a first prototype who
even had a contractor for a write the
moon but sadly as most kick off projects
it has to be stopped for different
reasons but the people I met they know
how I got from that creates a hope for
me that now I can build something
sustainable and do not repeat the same
mistakes and help others because we&#39;ve
been there we see we saw how you need
what you need to do to become the space
country and we can help others forth we
cannot do everything by ourselves and as
much as not-so-sexy point or as much as
I&#39;m disappointed all right about that
government needs to be involved we need
to pursue technology transfer agreements
with partner countries we need to
finally become a full member of European
Space Agency and we need our government
to start taking not only space but
science overall more seriously this is
our future and we cannot wait even more
because later on can be too late people
do stuff people organize this organize
themselves but if government will void
every time till something is done from
the other side at the time lag between
demand of actions and the supply of
actions can be devastating and not for
the in not only for the initiatives a
Space Lab but for other private projects
and private and individual projects so
we can start an engine we can build a
critical mass of people that would shake
things up
we even can overcome cross rules to do
that but in order for you to make to
become sustainable it has to take more
serious position in political agenda so
in my opinion the first step that we
need to take are pretty clear and based
in their simple we need to showcase the
science is interesting in the highest
meaning not only the process we need to
start communicating about science as it
is an otherwise society from by creating
an illusion that it&#39;s unreachable and so
far away from their lives we need to
have scientists who would be able to
inspire people we need to create a
kickoff point for technology
consultation in space startups we need
to teach scientists to work together
with managers and finally we need to
push up science and political agenda
work out international agreements and
participate in Easter life because this
is the only way to show our
determination in
National Arena but I don&#39;t say that
every resource that government or people
have should be determined space industry
of course not
space is a bundle of all kinds of
science fields that exist I say let&#39;s
give people an environment where they
could rock the science and most
importantly commercialize it and earn
for a decent living from a work that
drives them forward
every little advancement in any science
field drives us closer to being a space
state we just need to be ready to adapt
them in the proper way so just let&#39;s
take of the queues of people that are
ready here and now to Lilith Lane in the
first rows of space arena let&#39;s give
them a chance let&#39;s put some trust in
them and amazing things will happen mark
my words
Thanks
