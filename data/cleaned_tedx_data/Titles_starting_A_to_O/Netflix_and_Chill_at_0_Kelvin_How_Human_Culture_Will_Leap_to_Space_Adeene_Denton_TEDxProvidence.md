astronauts watch movies too there&#39;s
hundreds of movies available for their
viewing pleasure on the International
Space Station because just like the rest
of us astronauts have to do things to
relax
however the dichotomy between life in
space and the movies on their screens
has led to some unusual occurrences over
the past 17 years that the space station
has operated one such moment was born
out of unexpected tragedy on February
1st 2003 the space shuttle Columbia
disintegrated upon re-entering the
Earth&#39;s atmosphere killing all seven
crew members NASA&#39;s launch program was
suspended indefinitely in the wake of
the catastrophe effectively marooning
three astronauts in space on the
International Space Station Don Pettit
Ken Bowersox and Nikolay boo Daren they
floated on the ISS wondering when their
trip home would come rationing their
coffee and watching their supplies
shrink there&#39;s different kinds of a loan
there&#39;s going into the woods to get away
from human contact kind of alone
and then there&#39;s floating in space not
knowing when or if someone&#39;s going to
come for you these three astronauts were
alone in a way the rest of us cannot
understand in this difficult time they
found themselves consciously and
unconsciously isolating themselves from
what we think of as terrestrial media
things like music movies and connections
to news and life on earth all of which
are traditionally available on the ISS
even as it hurtles past us at five miles
a second to deal with living life in
space in the face of an unexpected
challenge they threw themselves into the
business of being astronauts doing
experiments collecting data focusing on
easy achievements that signified their
ability to do their jobs
however after months of isolation they
began to feel as though staying away
from connections to earthly life was
causing them serious harm staring out
the window at the vastness of space and
the earth below could not slake the need
for something more so these three highly
qualified yet very isolated astronauts
sat down or rather they strapped
themselves in to watch their first movie
in months which was Tank Girl Pettit
Bowersox and who Darrin watched Tank
Girl a post-apocalyptic bloody can&#39;t be
masterpiece full of violence sexuality
and a sentient tank it was total culture
shock for them they couldn&#39;t finish the
movie that night as they floated in
their sleeping bags they couldn&#39;t sleep
going from the quiet regimen of Space
Station life living in the shadow of
their grief and fear to watching glory
petty in iced tea she&#39;s a cybernetic
villain across the Australian outback
overloaded their brains so why did they
do it to understand this unusual moment
in our history as a spacefaring species
we need to understand a little bit about
science and a little bit about art
likewise how the two intersect to
produce some of the most fundamental
parts of the human experience I&#39;m a
planetary scientist I am devoting years
of my life to studying the early
geologic history of Mars however I&#39;m
also a dancer for me being a dancer
means committing myself to a lifetime of
experimentation of probing the
connection between the physical what is
shown or can be produced by the body and
the metaphysical what my body moving can
evoke in you the intersection between
science and art is an unusual thing
because most of
I&#39;ve been told that there isn&#39;t one
however like water flowing through a
porous membrane each of them has shaped
the creation and development of the
other those three astronauts learned
something the night they watched Tank
Girl it&#39;s what researchers are still
reckoning with today astronauts like
regular people need contact with
cultural media with reminders of home
not necessarily because it reminds them
that they have something to go back to
but because it gives them a sense of
purpose of being a part of humanity
rather than just three people floating
in a heavily engineered tin can when we
make the choice to send humans out into
the void rather than our cleverly
engineered robots we have to reckon with
the ramifications of what that means
that in addition to needing to eat sleep
and exercise to operate at full capacity
astronauts also need to have a healthy
vibrant inner life they like the rest of
us need to connect and create when we
boldly go further out into the solar
system we will carry our culture with us
we&#39;ll have to in order to survive the
journey in the end it&#39;s just a matter of
how this is not a new concept NASA
scientists have been considering how to
best prepare astronauts for
long-duration spaceflight since we first
began our forays into space where it is
clear that even if we ascend to live
among the stars we are human and humans
will get bored or lonely
we&#39;re tired just like they do on earth
those people that we send on those first
big missions back to the moon and on to
Mars will be there to do a job their job
is to learn and explore and discover but
it&#39;s still a job at a highly demanding
one at that an astronaut workday on the
ISS today is 12 hours long
including mandatory exercise like
astronaut Mike Massimino once said you
gotta have a hobby something to do that
centers your mind Karen Nyberg brought
knitting supplies Scott Kelly brought
paperback books to read while he floated
in bed a guitar and a keyboard have
lived on the ISS for at least a decade
and of course there&#39;s always Tank Girl
but why thinking practically there&#39;s no
reason to knit in space or to bring
paperback books there&#39;s no purpose for
it in a world full of high-tech space
food and space science they seem like
anachronism
but this dichotomy between old mundane
things and the newest and best
technology human minds can dream up is a
sign it&#39;s the beginning of space culture
space culture the culmination of living
in space both physically through
spacecraft and mentally by building a
home their home for us on earth isn&#39;t
just the sights and sounds of the planet
it&#39;s all the little habits that have
become ingrained in us over decades of
life that&#39;s why astronauts all eat
dinner in a facsimile of Earth life
placing their bodies around a table and
strapping themselves down in order to
sit even when there&#39;s no scientific
justification for it provides a physical
reminder of home as astronauts live and
work in space they&#39;re doing more than
just figuring out how to efficiently
complete their tasks they are finding
ways to make themselves comfortable in
an environment where simply living is a
Herculean feat right now space culture
is in an unusual place because it&#39;s
still being born the ISS functions as a
remote outpost of semi terrestrial life
linked to the earth by a relatively
consistent supply chain
on board astronauts are doing the work
of figuring out how to live in space
long term how much we can produce in a
low gravity environment versus what we
need to take with us but as we embark on
bigger missions including longer
missions to the moon and on to Mars the
supply chain that currently does most of
the work of keeping the astronauts on
the ISS alive will either drastically
decrease or disappear completely going
to Mars is simply too far for a lot of
what we do right now to work resupply
trips to a human crew on Mars would take
too long the same conundrum also goes
for our less corporeal needs right now
astronauts on the ISS can blend their
lives in microgravity with reminders of
Earth sometimes successfully because
they&#39;re enabled by that very same supply
chain to do so they can receive care
packages from their families physical
reminders of the people and things they
care about going to Mars makes
everything harder but those longer
missions are where space culture will
truly come into its own when Pettit
Bowersox and boot Darren were
effectively stuck on the ISS they tried
to turn their days into space life which
to them meant focusing exclusively on
the science however space life is so
much more than that it&#39;s the act of
being human in space and if that sounds
like a trivial distinction it&#39;s really
not cutting out the fun things that make
astronauts people in favor of trying to
approach the efficiency of robotic
spacecraft isn&#39;t the crucial part of
what makes a good astronaut that&#39;s not
why we send people to space when we
could easily send robots instead it&#39;s
not just space life we&#39;re building up
there on the ISS or in future missions
in the Orion module it
space culture a weird future world where
people can watch a weird movie like Tank
Girl after doing a six-hour spacewalk if
they want to humanities space culture
despite obvious genetic similarities
will not be identical to that shared by
those of us who live on earth our
culture that is terrestrial culture is
dependent on gravity the gravity of the
earth makes us who we are not just in
how our muscles and bones are designed
to work but how we operate them in
pursuit of more abstract goals the
gravity of the earth defines how I
pursue that object over there or that
object down there and we have evolved so
perfectly that we barely notice that is
until we engage in activities that
resist it we run we jump we dance when
gravity is removed from the equation
each of these actions will change think
about dance as dance artists we examine
this precept of earth life the
experience of gravity and how to resist
it I jump knowing that I have to return
I stand on one foot knowing that as I
move the pole of the Earth&#39;s gravity
moves with me the dance moves that we
think of as impressive like large leaps
are impressive to us because they play
with gravity but it&#39;s not just fancy
dance though even the little moves each
of us do and we think no one&#39;s watching
usually involve bopping up and down or
shifting our weight from side to side
it&#39;s gravity at work a more energetic
version of this might involve a little
bit of jumping to communicate enthusiasm
so what am I supposed to do
good song comes on the spacecraft on the
way to Mars how am I supposed to shake
it off to answer that question is to
answer a deeper question why do we dance
why are we so invested in doing things
like knitting or making music or
watching movies that we expend the extra
effort to do them in space there is no
reason to knit in space the air
temperature is easily controllable and
the astronauts have plenty of clothes
but clearly producing warm clothes isn&#39;t
the explicit goal of the knitting to
make the effort of doing dance in space
to the point of removing it from its
context gravity we need to distill it
down to its basic qualities that we
value it&#39;s not movement itself that we
crave we move around all the time we
navigate the world by propelling our
bodies through it in a series of
efficient movements dance is something
different and not just because it&#39;s a
frequently unusual or inefficient way of
moving through space astronauts on the
ISS have already established the basic
movement patterns for life on the ISS
and microgravity they have a movement
vocabulary for traveling from one place
to another at various speeds and for
various purposes that are analogous to
walking and running on earth
these are the baseline of their lives
acquired and practiced until they are
used in service of practical goals other
astronauts can observe their movements
and infer information from their body
language they&#39;ve already accomplished an
amazing feat they have choreographed
their space in space but it&#39;s not dance
yet even if it looks graceful or
otherworldly
from our terrestrial reference frame I
am certain that dance will happen in
space maybe it already has and we on
earth just didn&#39;t recognize it for what
it was dance no matter where it is done
is the act of reveling in our own
humanity in the fragile physicality of
what we are and it&#39;s the constant of
terrestrial cultures across the globe in
space astronauts are constantly
wrestling with their own bodies to
survive trying to trick themselves into
experiencing gravity so that their
muscles won&#39;t deteriorate and they can
keep their eyesight as they explore the
hazards and wonders of their new living
space outside of their assigned tasks I
believe that they will dance the truth
of space culture and building it is this
we might bring things from Earth with us
either as physical reminders or carried
within our psyches but the moment we
begin to produce cultural work in space
its outward qualities will change even
if its intended meaning or purpose
remains the same space travel is a
journey it&#39;s not just about the
technology though that&#39;s important we
want to survive but it&#39;s also about
building a future in which humanity can
live in space and do so long-term and
that means encouraging astronauts to
create rich cultural lives up there
there will be the life on Mars one day
there will be life and there will be
culture people will get bored on Mars
and they will create they&#39;ll probably
even dance thank you
