narcissist it sounds nasty doesn&#39;t it
like an open losing sore painful to
experience social narcissism reflects
our current cultural reality its growth
is an increasing challenge to businesses
worldwide the word narcissism stems from
Greek mythology narcissus a young hunter
and an exceptionally handsome man one
day tired from hunting and the heat he
lies by a splendid spring as he&#39;s
drinking the water he sees his beautiful
image he falls madly in love he refuses
to drink for fear that his lovely image
will disappear in time he wastes away
still enamored with himself and his
death is marked by the growth of a
single flower a narcissus in our
unmissable world we are surrounded by
these selfish thirsty beings like our
parched Greek friend they are addicted
to feeling special admiration is
everything and if left unchecked this
cyst boils over into feelings of
entitlement blame overeating one&#39;s
abilities lashing out at criticism
arrogance and bullying with very little
room for empathy you all know one you
might even be sitting beside one you
might even be one well one thing we know
for sure is that their numbers are
increasing
a 30-year study reviewed the
narcissistic and empathetic traits of
college students in the 1980s when the
study began the numbers were pretty good
30 percent showed high traits of
narcissism with 70 percent showing
traits of empathy 30 years later into
our millennial generation the inverse is
true
they found that 70 percent of the
students had high narcissistic traits
and only 30% had traits of empathy this
is not to suggest that all Millennials
are narcissists but it does tell us that
the tendencies are much higher than
generations that have gone before why do
we care about that well because 40
percent of our current workforce are
Millennials in 2030 this number is going
to go up to 75 percent this is a real
challenge but not all narcissists are
created equal
there&#39;s special ones they&#39;ve estimated
that 1% of the population that&#39;s one in
a hundred are pathological these people
have narcissistic personality disorder
they are insecure sociopaths I like to
equate them in the plant world as an
invasive species they don&#39;t really fit
into any environment system especially a
work one next in line is our extreme
narcissist it&#39;s estimated that this is
between 6 to 10% of the population these
people are very special to although not
pathological they are extremely toxic I
like to equate them to a poison ivy
they&#39;re best left alone and untouched
the next grouping is our garden variety
these people aren&#39;t so bad
they&#39;re the mild two mediums and with a
little bit of management a little bit of
cultivation a little bit of care they
can have very good qualities they can be
incredibly driven they can be very
gauging very charming confident and
quite honestly they can get stuff done
now nobody really knows exactly why this
growth and narcissism has occurred but
the speculation is that it stems from
our individualistic and introspective
post-war culture this has also changed
parenting techniques where kids are
micro managed while the parents are
missing in action where praise is given
to raise self-esteem and every kid gets
a trophy also there&#39;s no free play and
instead we have a very early adoption of
an exposure to media so what regardless
of the cause these people can be
extremely difficult to employ and even
harder to work for but they&#39;re not going
away so how do we as business owners as
managers leverage these challenging
personalities to ensure that we have
successful businesses and positive
working environments the first step is
to hire accordingly in this situation
you must know that these personality
types exist you must watch for it by
doing so you can help to screen and weed
out those 10% the pathological and the
extreme narcissists we know that those
personality types are extremely toxic
and unproductive in the workplace even
as leaders additionally when you&#39;re
screening you need to identify not only
the job skills that are required but the
personal skills that complement that job
by doing so you can actually use the
strengths of these personalities to your
advantage we know that they&#39;re extremely
persuasive we know that they function
well as Islands in and of themselves we
know that they can be very engaging and
they are also extremely dedicated so by
marrying the personality skills with the
job itself you can ensure greater
success next define your environment you
must lead and empower the leaders
if you don&#39;t lead the narcissus will
weeds grow in cracks so make sure you
have strong leadership additionally
create a clan like environment
this is a team cohesive spirit the
greater good rules make sure you have a
group group success is your measurement
for all individuals by doing so you can
ensure a much greater powerful workforce
Google and Facebook are brilliant at
this
additionally they need to be fed and
they need to be fed constantly and
frequently we need to water them with
praise we need to give them raises and
incentives again frequently not as a
lump sum again we need to appraise them
as well and give them constant feedback
on how they&#39;re doing and nudge them and
keep them interact with the group goals
finally we need to create a supportive
work environment not only for the
narcissistic personalities but for
everybody else
by doing so you can ensure that there&#39;s
a good communication and if there&#39;s
behavior that&#39;s offside that it can be
checked quickly and without any kind of
penalties that to those people reporting
them next you need to clearly set your
expectations not only defining the job
skills required but the overall
workplace behavior that&#39;s acceptable to
you the more specific you are with
examples the better off you are this
again has to be reinforced frequently
people need to be reminded that this is
actually what is required next there&#39;s
accountability accountability at all
levels and again people need to be
reminded that confidence does not
necessarily equal competence
documentation is also important as a
protocol for this type of personality we
know that narcissists tend to be highly
litigious so you need to protect
yourself your employees and your
business by documenting poor work
behavior and clearly advising what next
steps are last but not least there needs
to be a clear disciplinary process in
place this needs to be a
at all levels from the CEO down it needs
to be consistently applied and there&#39;s
no free passes by doing so you can
increase morale in the company itself
and have consistency in the application
process
by following these three steps you can
effectively leverage these challenging
personalities and cultivate an
environment where all employees and your
business can bloom and thrive
