it wasn&#39;t until my best friend went to
prison that I became aware of the plight
of the incarcerated her heart-wrenching
stories opened my eyes to a world that I
did not know existed that I had
previously ignored and why shouldn&#39;t I
ignore it those people in that prison
have nothing to do with me
I was so wrong as a member of an
enlightened society with a compassionate
heart and a sense of duty instilled in
me during childhood I know that their
plight definitely has to do with me
we&#39;re all connected we&#39;re all in this
soup together and my specialty after
over 25 years and more than ten thousand
hours of experience is in physical
education and performing arts for
children and teens so that is how I
participate in my own tiny way to help
heal the ills of a massive and complex
criminal justice system in my tiny
beloved City
I shared my expertise and enthusiasm
with teenagers in our juvenile detention
center my friend Stacy spent 19 months
in a New Jersey prison she was an
otherwise law-abiding citizen but ended
up behind bars after a chain of events
that to me now seemed somehow
predestined for a higher purpose suffice
to say she got tangled up in a child
custody dispute between her then husband
and his ex-wife and things went terribly
wrong her felony conviction which should
have been in a civil courtroom never a
criminal one was later overturned but
not before her life was turned upside
down and inside out and she endured
horrible cruelty despite and because of
this hellish experience
she created a phenomenal nonprofit
organization for women in and leaving
prison to provide assistance with
transportation to parole appointments
housing clothing
coaching for job interviews I remember
giggling at the picture of her minivan
stuffed just bursting at the seams with
bras that were on route to a women&#39;s
facility they offered support in many
ways because I I didn&#39;t know that things
like feminine hygiene products and bras
are considered luxuries and not
necessities when you&#39;re locked up when
she was released she could have just
walked away and never looked back but
she chose to stay and make a positive
enormous difference in the lives of
thousands not only those women but their
families and communities as well in so
doing she inspired me and many others
Viktor Frankl the Austrian neurologist
and psychiatrist who survived three
years in concentration camps during the
Holocaust wrote that which is to give
light must endure burning my friend
exemplifies this idea she uses her
suffering to help others now knowing and
loving her as I do and believing in the
work she was doing I wanted to add my
light to her enormous flame and you know
show some support for her work without
having to go to New Jersey and so I
asked her what I might do here in Nevada
to support the mission and she suggested
that I simply continue the work I was
already doing that the dance in
gymnastics classes I was teaching were
precisely the sorts of activities that
would keep kids from ever needing to go
to prison in the first place so I poured
myself into my work more intently than
ever but always with the idea in my mind
that I would like to serve those who are
caught up in the system several years
later I was offered an opportunity to
teach in our local juvenile detention
center and I literally jumped at the
chance when I was asked to submit a
proposal I immediately decided on
improvisational acting the type made
popular by the TV show whose line is it
anyway
improv as it&#39;s known is made up of games
and
structures that create scenes out of
thin air from just a few words to an
hour or more of unscripted dialogue
there are no materials required anyone
can do it almost anywhere and it&#39;s fun
the well-known yes and mantra of improv
encourages us to seek agreement and
cooperation now that and really every
aspect of improv lends easily to our
lives improv roads confidence public
speaking skills creative expression
expansion of vocabulary imagination
relationship building and give-and-take
in relationships the importance of
listening and responding honestly and of
course
laughter glorious laughter the gifts of
this particular discipline are good for
everyone especially for young people who
are still trying to figure out who they
are and how to relate to others in my
first visit to the detention center
about halfway through the first class
one of the boys just stopped and he had
this enormous smile and wide eyes and he
looked at me and said you&#39;re hyper and
it&#39;s contagious
they all obviously enjoyed the
activities and I felt very relieved and
delighted by their willing participation
and excitement but when our time was up
and they were asked to sit down to wait
to be escorted out the smiles instantly
disappeared the room seemed to go gray
and deflate like a punctured balloon but
I know that the positive energy we
stirred up that day was real and
potentially transformative I left there
that day wondering if I would see all of
them again they come and go and I simply
felt grateful for the time I still do
every week since then I have seen
soft-spoken kids find their voice I have
seen active kids find an outlet and
appreciation from a grown-up who is also
hyper and I have enjoyed moments like
the time a newcomer turned to the boy
next to him after class and said I
didn&#39;t want to do that at first but that
was fun
and I cherished moments like the time a
three-line scene spontaneously turned
into a 20 line scene I said you&#39;re
getting it and we all felt it not every
class is great we&#39;re humans we have
moods but they thank me every week
unprompted at the end of class and I
know that when carrying adults from the
community take time to share with these
kids it makes a very clear statement to
them that they are cared for valued and
worth it across the country advocates
and administrators are working to change
the culture of juvenile justice from
punitive to rehabilitative for example
there&#39;s a program called girls court
that provides social services to young
female offenders who themselves have
been victims of trauma and the book
neglecting abuse there are alternative
sentencing programs that provide
counseling and vocational training and
in addition to academic studies over
half of the juvenile detention centers
in the u.s. now provide some sort of
supplementary arts program and evidence
is clear that these types of programs
have many positive outcomes like
decreases in violent behavior increases
in self-control and cooperation and a
reduction in tension not only for the
participants but also for staff in the
center I visit yoga drawing financial
literacy and entrepreneurship program
and substance abuse training substance
abuse deterring education are made
available they are doing a great job and
I feel very proud and honored to play
even a small part on their team it is
way too easy
to allow the out-of-sight out-of-mind
mentality to help us ignore what&#39;s going
on in our prisons jails and juvenile
detention centers too often it isn&#39;t
until someone we know and love gets
caught up in the system that we be made
aware as I did until then it&#39;s
- easy to dismiss those on the inside as
criminals who deserve the suffering and
deprivation they&#39;re experiencing because
they broke a law yes criminal activity
absolutely should carry a punishment but
no debt to society should be paid by any
means that are dehumanizing cruel and
traumatic before my friend Stacy went to
prison I had no idea how inhumane these
institutions can be for me to experience
even a little bit of empathy
she once suggested that I spend 23 of 24
hours locked in my bathroom for a
weekend and then imagine what that would
feel like for a year or two or five it
occurs to me that this is the future
these kids have to look forward to if we
don&#39;t nurture them and redirect their
paths they need our attention our love
our forgiveness and our guidance we a
caring community can give them that
vital sense of belonging and we know now
it&#39;s that sense of connection that
diminishes the desires to get high or
take dangerous risks can encourage them
to continue doing the next right thing
so that rational thinking becomes not
only preferable but second nature to the
question what can I do to help
I suggest paying attention to state and
local legislation that speaks to issues
of juvenile justice in Nevada last year
a be 180 was passed the juvenile justice
bill of rights which doesn&#39;t create new
rights but codifies existing ones and
guarantees that all juvenile offenders
be made aware of their rights right -
state representatives in support of
rehabilitative programs for kids and a
fiscal responsibility is your top
priority keep in mind that for every
dollar we spend on programs like this
now we potentially save five to ten
dollars in the future if these kids
avoid getting incarcerated as adults
seek out books articles documentaries
about the prison industrial complex and
our juvenile justice system as painful
as they are to take in we need to be
informed and
if like me you enjoy working with
youngsters get involved call your local
center propose a class or join a youth
Mentor Program my friend Stacy is now
living in sunny Southern California
raising her three amazing daughters and
mentoring others including foreign
exchange students the organization that
she started on the East Coast is still
going strong
in the hands of others and I&#39;ll close
with this I think one of the best TED
Talks ever given we need to talk about
an injustice was given by Bryan
Stevenson he is the he&#39;s a well
respected public interest lawyer and the
executive director and founder of the
equal justice initiative in Montgomery
Alabama he says often that each of us is
more than the worst thing we&#39;ve ever
done I know that we can share this idea
with our youth we demonstrate to them
through our action we can provide them
the second chance that they deserve we
all deserve a second chance thank you
[Applause]
