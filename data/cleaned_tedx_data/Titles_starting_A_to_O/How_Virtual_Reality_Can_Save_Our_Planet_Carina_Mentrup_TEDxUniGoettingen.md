I&#39;m here because I believe that
immersive technologies can save our
planet in this talk I&#39;m going to explain
to you how I do research an education
for sustainable development sustainable
development does all concerned with
changing the way people think and act so
that they make more sustainable choices
for the future of our planet
changing the way people think and act is
a very difficult thing to do that&#39;s why
I was looking for a method and medium a
technology anything that could support
education for sustainable development
about a year ago at Seaver 2016 and
Hannover Germany I came across virtual
reality for the very first time I went
on a beautiful ride across a valley and
mountains and had a good time there was
just one thing I&#39;m very very scared of
heights which is why I was scared the
whole time through in virtual reality
your brain actually things that what you
see is what your body is experiencing
people are out we were laughing at me I
was clinging on to the broom I was
shaking because I was scared to fall off
and break my neck this is how real it
looked to me that was the very first
time I realized how powerful this
technology is I also met a dinosaur I
fought him with my hand back everyone
was safe and I also befriended this
little guy this is what we call
augmented reality maybe you&#39;ve come
across it before from then on I was
quite interested in immersive
technologies and I went to a V
Villar is short for virtual reality to a
VR conference and that&#39;s where bums into
the guys from Sens lab IO they were
presenting something educational in VR I
spoke to them and said what you using
this in education what do you do and
they said well here you can learn how to
handle machines and I said up can I try
this out and they said of course you can
so I learned how to handle a machine
inside the virtual reality it felt real
and I had the feeling that I would know
how to handle this in reality I spoke to
the guys and said well if you can teach
people how to handle a machine inside
the virtual reality do you think you
could also teach people how to handle
the environment for what they said said
the environment like oh yeah maybe how
do you want to do that I said well give
me some time to think about that and
this is something I&#39;ve been thinking
about for many months now I&#39;ve been
inside a creative tunnel and I&#39;ve been
trying to learn everything I possibly
can about immersive technologies and how
we can use them in education especially
when it comes to education on climate
change this is something I&#39;ve been
thinking about a lot how can we get
people to go from thinking ego to eco I
think the problem with the people on the
ego side is that they don&#39;t understand
that we are part of a system that our
lives depend on that there is a CO
dependence between every living creature
on this planet and that our lives depend
on that system functioning it is not us
and nature it is not us above nature it
is us inside nature and the sooner we
realize the better
I think that bringing people to the
ecocide is possible with virtual reality
experiences you can leap out into the
world you can take people around the
globe you can even go to space and you
can create a sense for the world a sense
that we so desperately need I&#39;m pretty
sure that not many of us are conscious
enough yet I don&#39;t think that this
summer you&#39;ll be attending your friends
barbecue look at the steak you&#39;re having
and say hmm me eating the steak
I wonder what impact this has on the
rainforests in South America or even I
wonder what impact this has on climate
I&#39;m pretty sure that some people will
never invite you to that barbecues again
if you say something like that and I can
also imagine one or two people who would
actually say something something like
stop talking about climate change it&#39;s
all over the news I&#39;m worried enough I
just want to enjoy my burger well if
you&#39;re worried enough think twice six
days ago he who must not be named has
announced that he will withdraw from the
Paris agreement part of my educational
mission is to make sure that people who
have a vote will never ever give their
vote to somebody who denies climate
change to somebody who is not willing to
make changes on behalf of our planet I
don&#39;t want to blame anyone I think that
many of the voters just didn&#39;t know
better they weren&#39;t educated enough on
climate change I want to give them the
benefit of the doubt so how do I
actually want to do this now in virtual
reality first of all I&#39;d like you to
know that I want to wrap up information
for you there is so much out there you
the news and they tell you don&#39;t do this
don&#39;t do that anymore this is not good
for the environment for that don&#39;t
consume meat and if you consume meat and
if you eat it you&#39;re a murderer and if
you get on a plane to fly on holiday
you&#39;re killing polar bears and if you&#39;re
enduring life too much you&#39;re a bad
person anyway
I don&#39;t think that that is the way how
we can get to the hearts of the people
who aren&#39;t environmentalists yet I think
education is the key a ocation is the
most powerful force we have and it&#39;s
peaceful this is how I would like to
make the experience look like I would
start with you inside the virtual
reality you as an individual in an
everyday life situation where you get to
make choices for example you&#39;re inside a
supermarket in VR you can interact you
can either use your hands or your eyes
and you can for example grab a product
that contains palm oil in the next scene
we can leap out into the world and show
you what effect this has on the
rainforests you can actually stand
inside a rainforest and be fascinated by
the beauty of it and you can get
concerned about the impact you have on
the environment then as the next step I
would like to go back into that very
everyday life situation you&#39;ve started
so that if you&#39;re concerned enough you
can learn what better choices you can
make with this idea I was there at the
end of 2016 I&#39;m not a developer I can&#39;t
develop apps like that I come from the
educational side it was very very very
good timing that the tech mention took
place it&#39;s an event that
is a mix of a hackathon and a convention
and people from the VR community gather
there and they try to work on innovative
ideas they let me pitch my idea to the
crowd of developers and I was so very
lucky to find six guys who were willing
to work with me on that idea completely
for free you know no profit involved we
decided to create an experience that is
concerned with marine pollution through
microplastics
it&#39;s a very very urgent matter as we
speak in New York City the United
Nations are currently gathering at their
ocean conference in this AB experience
you take on the perspective of a fish
and you learn that fish cannot
distinguish between microplastics
and plankton and that sea creatures end
up eating plastics you also learn that
this gets back to you in your everyday
life and plastic enters our food chain
this prototype I will test with students
as part of my research because I would
like to find out how we can implement
experiences like this into lessons in
this case geography lessons I would like
to support science teachers when they
try to bring climate change closer to
their students so that eventually these
students change the way they think and
act because that&#39;s the aim of education
for sustainable development remember I
will publish my research findings on
saving planet a.com and you can read
through it if you like you can also join
the project it&#39;s a social project if
you&#39;re a scientist or a developer or
just somebody who cares or creative
what I want to bring to you with these
experiences and with this talk tonight
is that the future of our planet does
not lie in the hands of a few world
leaders you as individuals have an
impact on climate you met her you met it
to us you met it to the planet and you
can make a difference while you&#39;re here
if we don&#39;t team up on this our children
and the children of our children will
have nowhere to go
my project is called VR saving planet a
because there is no planet B I hope you
like the idea
