I&#39;m going to start today with a question
and I&#39;d love for you to really give it
some thought my question is this when is
the last time you said to yourself this
is going to be a bad day
in other words when&#39;s the last time you
felt the weight of life crashing down
upon you take a moment and think about
that hopefully you have your moment in
your mind or you&#39;re close to having it
in your mind because I have a couple
follow-up questions for you the first
follow-up question I have is what
happened what happened to you to cause
yourself to think this is gonna be a bad
day perhaps it was pulling into the
office and spilling coffee all over
yourself or maybe it was showing up to
class and finding out there&#39;s a pop quiz
when you forgot to do the readings last
night where maybe it&#39;s a recent medical
diagnosis you received what was it for
you that happened and my second
follow-up question is when when did you
know your day was going to be bad if I
had to take a guess it was probably
before you even got to work or got to
school and for some of you it was before
you even got out of bed which brings me
to my third and most important follow-up
question which is how did you know how
did you know that your day was going to
turn out badly
I actually had the answer for you and
the answer is a simple one you didn&#39;t
you had no way of knowing how your day
was going to turn out and yet you had
already decided so why is that well
that&#39;s because the human brain loves
assumptions we like to take things that
happen to us recently and assume how our
future is going to turn out based on
those things and for those of us that
get caught up in our bad day moments we
get caught up in our negative
assumptions and if we start to let these
negative assumptions build and build we
can run into quite a few problems in my
work with people with anxiety and
depression
I hear about negative assumptions all
the time I hear things like Maria I just
know this meetings not gonna go well or
I&#39;m not gonna be able to do this project
at my job I just know it all right here
things like Maria this is gonna be a bad
year for me I can feel it
and for some I hear things like what&#39;s
the point in life if everything&#39;s been
so bad for me so far I just know it&#39;s
going to continue to be bad those are
some really tough questions people start
assuming because of negative assumptions
so go back to that thought I asked you
to think about for your bad day moment
because every time we have these bad day
moments and feelings there&#39;s something
that we want to change so what was it
for you you wanted to change perhaps you
wanted to change something with your
family maybe it looks something like I
wish my kids listen to me better or
I wish my parents saw me as the
independent adult that I am or maybe for
some of you it didn&#39;t involve your
family maybe it had to do with your job
or your friends I wish I had a job that
paid more money I wish my manager could
see my full potential I wish my friends
called me more often where maybe for
some of you the change you want is a bit
bigger and it has to do with your
community maybe it&#39;s something like I
wish we had better roads I wish our
public schools were better for our kids
maybe still the change you need it for
your life was even bigger than any of
these maybe it has to do with the things
going on in the world today maybe some
of the stuff that we&#39;ve been hearing
about on the news the thing is no matter
what it was that you wanted to change
none of this can change until you first
change you because the only thing we
really have the ability to change is
ourselves and if we can figure out how
to change ourselves to a more positive
mindset then this begins to create a
ripple effect into our family our job
our friends into our community and yes
even into the world it all has to start
with you first so how do we go about
doing this well one of the ways we can
do this is by following a few steps now
I&#39;ve outlined four steps that can really
start to create this positive change
within you and so step number one I
simply want you to notice so the next
time you wake up and you think to
yourself this is going to be a bad day
notice it that&#39;s all I want for step
number one or the next time you think to
yourself before you go into that meeting
at work this I just feel it it&#39;s not
gonna go well notice it because then
step number two is I want you to start
learning to question yourself question
these thoughts question these feelings
that you have ask yourself am i trying
to predict the future right now am i
assuming something because remember none
of us can actually predict the future we
can take some pretty good guesses what
we don&#39;t know for certain and then step
number three find your positive
alternatives to that negative moment
that you&#39;re in so let&#39;s go back and
revisit some of those examples I had
mentioned previously
so say you pull up to work and you end
up spilling coffee all over yourself and
you think how is there a positive
alternative to this well what is that&#39;s
the only negative thing that happens to
you all day what if when you get into
work today&#39;s the day you finally get
that promotion you had been hoping for
and overall when you go to bed you
realize this is one of the best days
you&#39;ve had in a long time what about if
you receive a really difficult medical
diagnosis and you find yourself thinking
there&#39;s no way I can get through this
I just can&#39;t a positive alternative is I
can and I will get through this what
about for showing up to class and
realizing there&#39;s that pop quiz on the
readings you forgot to do last night
well positive alternative say if you
think about what the lecture was last
time you take some really good educated
guesses maybe you&#39;re gonna get through
that pop quiz just fine plus it&#39;s a
learning lesson for next
making sure you do those readings and
then step number four which to me is the
most important step of all this step is
gratefulness thinking about the things
in your life that are positive already
things that you can already be thankful
for what are they for you maybe for some
of us it&#39;s the fact that we have very
supportive family and friends maybe it&#39;s
the fact that we have our health for
those of us wishing we had a different
job well we can be grateful for the fact
we have a job right now and we&#39;re able
to pay our bills and if you&#39;re finding
it really hard to think about things to
be grateful for but I&#39;m going to give
you one you can use any day anytime and
that is I woke up today
and I have a new day to try and make the
change I want to make my life better now
the thing about these four steps I&#39;ve
talked about today is I&#39;m going to need
you to practice them before you need
them so what do I mean by that I mean
before you even find yourself feeling
like today is gonna be a bad day I want
you to have gone through these steps
think about when we do fire drills or
tornado drills we don&#39;t do these drills
when there&#39;s actually a fire that would
be total chaos we need to know what to
do before we need it and so by
practicing these steps especially
gratefulness when we have those bad day
moments we know exactly what it is we
need to do and how to do it so when you
find yourself feeling like life is just
crushing down upon you
and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna be able
to get through this moment remember you
have a choice you can either continue to
stay miserable or you can choose to
change your mindset to a more positive
one and end up like this thank you
[Applause]
you
