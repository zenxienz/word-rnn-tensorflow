well good morning everybody
what an event this is I&#39;m thrilled to be
here especially as you heard I graduated
here in 1960 from here in 1964 now the
math nerds among you are going just like
that
1964 that&#39;s 53 years ago that guy&#39;s got
to be over 70 years old and you&#39;d be
right
71 in fact but the thing about getting a
little older
I say a little older is that actually
you stop caring what people think or
what people say about you and so you can
just kind of put it out and so it&#39;s in
that spirit that I ask this question do
you think men are more intelligent than
women
or do you think women are more
intelligent than men let&#39;s just have a
little straw poll who thinks men are
more intelligent than women
yeah the men are a little reluctant but
it&#39;s all men that are voting for that
one who thinks women are more
intelligent oh boy just like that ha
well that said something right there
you know the fact is a quick look at
history will tell you that that really
men have been the major contributors and
and creators of advancements in science
and mathematics you know biology
chemistry physics and certainly in the
Applied Sciences engineering economics
psychology you know and they have been
also the major contributors they&#39;ve done
the lion&#39;s share of contribution in
history philosophy in in music arts and
so you know when we think about it
all the great profits that have come to
earth they&#39;re all men and the
individuals that came after them and
took their message and created religions
and lead religions all men when was the
last time we had a female Pope you know
doesn&#39;t happen yeah so you know when you
when you start to think of it you know
and in business and in government once
again oh man although things are
starting to change just in the last few
decades but before we can put a tick
under male on that one we kind of have
to we&#39;re not we kind of have to we have
to we have to see what the the female
thinks of that with those last few
comments and I can hear women saying
okay yeah we&#39;ll give you that yeah you
guys have dominated politics in in
religion and in government there&#39;s no
question about that and actually while
we&#39;re at it we&#39;ll throw in medicine and
science and law and a bunch of other
things so the question that we have for
you guys is how are you doing so far
with the planet yeah how is that working
you got this global warming thing
figured out and be able to feed
everybody on the planet we can do it
operationally but we don&#39;t seem to be
able to do it what&#39;s happening in Iran
and in the
least in North Korea and in many
countries in Africa yeah so we we can&#39;t
really put that tick up there just yet
now one of the things that I think we
most of us agree on is is that women are
thought to be more emotional than men
that men are somehow more rational that
they kind of think through the
consequences of their words and actions
before they initiate although the
current President of the United States
would be one example that where that
just doesn&#39;t hold so yeah if if men are
so rational and I&#39;m sorry in that and
that women tend to come from they&#39;re
more from their feelings and will
reflect on it later but but here&#39;s
another question if if men are so
rational if they do think things through
before they act how come of the 11
million people right now currently in
jails around the world incarcerated how
come fully 95 percent of them are men
yeah I don&#39;t think we can put a tick up
there just yet on that score now one
thing we can all agree on both genders
that can agree on is is the fact that
men are physically stronger than women
and in fact have been physically
stronger right from the beginning
through to this day and and so before
the atom was smashed and the books were
written and religions were created you
know before music and language and fire
you know when we were really literally
crawling out of the swamp six million
years ago that one biological fact that
is the superiority of male physical
strength has has given the male the
ability to control and at times dominate
the situations in which they are are in
and it has set the tone it has actually
framed formed and maintained this
relationship that has existed between
male and female since the very beginning
so it isn&#39;t really about intelligence
it&#39;s actually about physical strength
and that&#39;s been going on for literally
male
of years and in actual fact if if your
criteria is is the survival of the
species well you&#39;d have to say it&#39;s
worked its we&#39;re flourishing you know so
men became hunters and gatherers and
protectors and sort of can work outside
of the home or the cave with sticks and
stones and the women worked inside the
home bearing children raising children
preparing the food and so we have these
different roles forming up different
ways of living our lives but in actual
fact we do have the same levels of
intelligence now if we if we go back
actually to the time of Christ there
were literally only well not only but
but 300 million people living on the
planet at that time less than the
population of the United States so
plenty of room and spaces resources for
for everyone
food although we still squabble it a lot
then as well and it took it took
eighteen hundred years to go from 300
million to 1 billion people 1800 years
then things really kicked into gear that
was the start of the Industrial
Revolution took only one hundred years
to go from 1 billion to two billion 1900
and then only 60 years to go to 3
billion and you know where this is going
you&#39;ve seen the numbers today 50 57
years later we are at seven-and-a-half
billion people on the planet so whatever
is going on in the earth with all the
issues and all the creation all the
wonderful things and all the not so
wonderful things the dominant overriding
issue that is going on in our world and
will be for the rest of your lives and
the rest of the lives of your children
is this massive explosion in population
which means a huge change in living
conditions and it also means that you
and I living here right now are going to
have to make changes in our life in
order to survive
Darwin told us this 150 years ago
he said adapt or perish that&#39;s it two
choices that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got and so you
know we we ran into a situation in the
early in 1800s late 1760s where the
world&#39;s population doubled just like
that and so hence came the Industrial
Revolution which is basically a chapter
in history of a group of people trying
to find ways to survive this incredible
growth and today it&#39;s the same thing and
that&#39;s while technology is here to help
us to survive to survive that explosion
now really the human beings you know
survive not only survive but flourish
and you know the history all of a sudden
over a very short period of time we had
the steam engine we had electricity we
had light bulbs we had telephones we had
the internal combustion engine man
flight and he just went on and on
literally every decade there was these
incredible cures incredible developments
and here we are today we survived that
and I&#39;m glad we did otherwise you
wouldn&#39;t be here neither what neither
would i but there are some consequences
to that kind of expression of humanity
when it&#39;s trying to survive and one of
those consequences is that the the
education system in the early 1800s
totally controlled about men filled with
young men and young boys being taught
students then went on a mass of training
literally 200 250 year training exercise
in developing our intellects and we know
that it worked we survived as a species
but one of the side effects is is that
we succeeded in producing generation
after generation of intellectually
overbuilt but emotionally underdeveloped
males and here we are today we have
books that we read that you know men are
from Mars and women are from Venus and
never the two will meet it&#39;s a it&#39;s
they&#39;ve got a lot of humor but also a
lot of wisdom and
main point of view put across is that
men come from their intellects they lead
their life from their intellects they
see things intellectually that&#39;s how we
create these in these inventions and
these creations in order to survive in
women come from their heart they express
their emotions and so you know a man
today says emotions feelings you want to
talk about that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
complicated it&#39;s confusing it&#39;s
disruptive it&#39;s very messy oh my god
she&#39;s crying what the hell am I going to
do now well here&#39;s a couple of thoughts
or a few thoughts that I&#39;ve picked up
about emotions and feelings along the
way feelings feelings without words
convey context and perspective and
understanding feelings feelings help us
to understand without words the other
person&#39;s point of view facts help we
forget facts all the time but you know
what you never forget a feeling if I had
a piece of yellow cedar here in my hand
right now with that sweet and pungent
smell and I took a sniff just like that
I would be filled with memories and
feelings and sensations of my father and
he died sixty-five years ago just like
that immediate facts go in and out of
here at the speed of light feelings
Lodge and they queue as an instructive
instruct us for the rest of our our life
it&#39;s starting to become actually a much
more important dimension than I think
males have thought for a period of time
so not only that at the feelings if I if
I think about facts for a minute
you know I&#39;m I&#39;m 6 foot 2 and 220 pounds
I&#39;ve got blue eyes and ball they&#39;re
white hair and the meniscus in my right
knee started to bother me about two
months ago you think though that set of
facts is of any assistance to me right
now as I&#39;m speaking to you it&#39;s
not only of no assistance it&#39;s it&#39;s
really of no no value to me the other
thing or the last thing on this point is
is that feelings precede thought
feelings generate motion activity
Institute or in initiate behavior
actually feelings are the source we call
it II motion this conference is about
drive Drive originates here we can
direct it we can frame it we can
schedule it we can time it we can focus
it up here with this intellect with this
central processing unit but it
originates here so that being the case
if you look in the dictionary under the
word smart what you&#39;ll see is
quick-witted grasps concept quickly
it says mental power mental strength and
really that that&#39;s a description of this
central processing unit it&#39;s a
description of your intellect it
processes data and if you look under the
dictionary in the dictionary under the
word intellect
it says the capacity for thinking and
reasoning as distinct from feeling two
separate functions if if you look at the
next word in the dictionary under
intellect enter interestingly enough it
happens to be intelligence kind of
something different now has entered the
equation and of intelligence
it says the capacity for understanding
for perceiving and comprehending meaning
Oh meaning okay now what does it say
about meaning it says the sense and
certain significance of a word a
sentence an action a symbol
it talks about the the true
interpretation or intended purpose of a
speech or a message or an action so what
we&#39;ve done in the last minute is gone
from a discussion of our intellect and
moved down to our heart and to our
emotions and to our feelings and the
thing is when you combine those two
aspects of yourself in the right amount
at the right time in the right way
you actually create intelligence you
create meaning you create insights in
fact you create your intelligence your
meaning your insight and in that moment
some interesting things happen the world
slows down it doesn&#39;t speed up you
become calmer and quieter you don&#39;t
become louder and more excited you gain
clarity you become more clear because
you can in that moment you can see
further and you can see deeper into and
these are the moments of personal growth
these are the moments of growth in your
maturity in your intelligence and in
your confidence and self confidence in
you and the world around you so these
are important moments we have this body
we walk around and we are made up of
only two things really we were made up
of our intellect we&#39;re made up of our
emotions and you know neuroscience
shines a really interesting light on
this because it tells us that that our
feelings originated in the reptilian
portion of our brain at the same time
for men and for women
and that literally millions of years
later the thinking function began to
install itself into our brain and lodged
itself in the frontal lobes and we call
this the executive function or the
intellect and you know one day
the intellect may become the rulers of
our emotions but we are a long way from
that in an evolutionary sense so you
know when I know just in closing here I
will say to you that you know this is
this is really an interesting school and
it&#39;s a really successful school you know
things like this occurring are wonderful
events and there&#39;s a lot of reasons why
it&#39;s successful but there&#39;s actually two
pieces that I think are a huge part of
the success of this institution and one
is about 25 years ago this school was
the first school in cat first
independent school in Canada that said
we&#39;re going co-educational and boy was
Brentwood ridiculed and teased at that
time what are they doing can you imagine
a year later the head of school at the
time bill Ross was asked what was the
impact and he said without a shadow of a
doubt it has improved the behavior and
and a much more balanced approach to
life on behalf of all of the students
it&#39;s a much healthier and much set much
more sensible place for students to grow
and live and learn and the other thing
that you all know about is that over the
years here your program has evolved into
three separate parts
one-third of which is the arts one-third
of the resources one-third of the
facilities one-third two-third of the
energy and effort is devoted to the arts
which is a specific attempt initiative
to develop this aspect of the human
being and that&#39;s what makes this place
so alive and so highly functional and
such a great place to to to live and
learn so I would leave you with one
challenge and I would say talk about
this talk to your head to your house
parents talk to your teachers talk to
the head of school and say if if we&#39;re
so comfortable being on the leading edge
well why not take that third step and
begin to include in your curriculum
courses which specifically address the
issue of a healthy and highly
function balance between emotions and
intellect and in that way we can secure
this this development of healthy highly
function and successful adults so I got
to thank you very very much it was just
wonderful for wonderful to be here and
just a great experience to be able to
talk to you about this this important
topic thanks very much
