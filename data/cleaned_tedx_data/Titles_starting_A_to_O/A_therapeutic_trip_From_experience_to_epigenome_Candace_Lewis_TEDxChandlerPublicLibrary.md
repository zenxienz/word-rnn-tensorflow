common mental disorders can be thought
of as a lack of connection a lack of
connection with self in a lack of
connection with community mental health
is a current public crisis every day
over 90 Americans are dying due to
opiate overdose and over 20 veterans are
dying to suicide it&#39;s important for our
health to build connections in many
different ways for example as a
scientist it&#39;s important for me to
connect with other scientists from
around the world and last year I was
able to do this on a Fulbright
fellowship where I studied the effects
of drugs on brain at the University of
Zurich psychiatric hospital even more
important we need to establish and
maintain personal connections I was also
able to do this last year when I married
this wonderful woman who also happens to
be a neuroscientist but these are
examples of when connection goes right
we have positive experiences with our
community what happens when the office
is highly stressful or traumatic
experiences are large predictors for
many psychiatric disorders experiences
such as armed robbery sexual abuse child
maltreatment and combat all of these
experiences predict many disorders not
just post-traumatic stress disorder or
PTSD but common mood anxiety personality
and substance use disorders are all
linked to these negative experiences and
we&#39;ve known this for a long time we&#39;ve
known the relationship between
experiences and mental health but what
we didn&#39;t know we didn&#39;t understand was
the connection how is it that the things
that we experience can then influence
our mental health and that brings me to
the new field of neuro epigenetics and
this is one connection in which we have
found in molecular mechanism by which
our experiences can shape our
neurobiology so what are app genetics to
explain this I have to get to the
molecular science for a moment every
cell of your body
carries the blueprint for life your own
unique
nucleotide sequence in the sequence code
for what proteins to build when and
where but even though every cell of your
body is carrying the same code it&#39;s not
following the same instructions our
cells build different proteins this is
why we have different types of cells we
have skin cells and bone cells and blood
cells and my favorite brain cells
they&#39;re not following the same Cohen
this is what epigenetics is epigenetics
can be thought of as on and off switches
or up and down switches for what
proteins to build and what we&#39;ve learned
in the last couple decades is that
traumatic experiences have the capacity
to change these epigenetic markers these
up and down switches on genes implicated
in mental health this is a molecular
mechanism by which our experiences can
shape us another way of illustrating the
difference between genetics and
epigenetics is with identical twins when
they&#39;re born they have near identical
genomes that they will continue to have
for the rest of their life but they&#39;re
born already with slightly different
epigenetics and those differences in
their epigenetics will only grow with
age because we know that many
experiences and things in our
environment change our epigenetics such
as nutrition exercise toxins stress
drugs and this is not necessarily a bad
thing
this is really quite a fantastic idea
this shows that our brain has the
ability to continuously respond to
ever-changing social cues throughout our
entire life which leads me to wonder if
traumatic experiences can be so powerful
as to change our epigenome in a way that
changes our physiology and downstream
behavior and mental health is it
possible that a profound experience
could also be so powerful as a change
our epigenome in down trips downstream
physiology and perhaps heal mental
health we all have profound experiences
throughout life experiences such as
getting married welcoming a child into
our home putting our all into a goal and
achieving it or not
or spiritual experience whether it be if
nature or religion is it possible that a
profound experience much like a
traumatic experience can come in and
alter our epigenome in a way that leads
to healing if this was possible how
would we do it how could we induce a
profound experience in a therapeutic
setting what would it look like one idea
is to use a psychoactive substance to
use our current knowledge of
pharmacology and how drugs affect our
brain this wouldn&#39;t be so far off from
our current mental health treatment
paradigms already we already use a wide
variety of drugs to treat many disorders
often on a daily basis and there happens
to be a class of drugs that people have
been taking for millennia to purposely
induce profound experiences and many
cultures from around the world seen as
class of drugs as healing medicines
this is psychedelics now this might seem
like a silly proposition at first these
are in fact legal illegal substances
right now they&#39;ve been a controversial
topic ever since the 1960s but while
they are powerful substances and should
be regarded cautiously I&#39;m here to say
that they got a bad rap so what do I
mean by psychedelics what are plastic
psychedelics the chima is commonly known
in North America our LSD or acid in
magic mushrooms or psilocybin classic
psychedelics work on your serotonin
system serotonin is a neurotransmitter
highly implicated in regulating mood and
perception and right now the most
commonly prescribed antidepressants work
on your serotonin system so what is a
psychedelic I swear it&#39;s like I&#39;m
sitting here telling you that we can
induce a profound experience what does
that look like what does it feel like to
answer this question let&#39;s turn to the
research literature so I&#39;m not talking
about recreational use I&#39;m talking about
what is that we find in the science and
a controlled study when these
participants have adequate preparation
expectations and dosing
one of the most commonly known and
perhaps misunderstood effects of
psychedelics are the sensory alterations
and of course this is where they get
their other term hallucinogens now while
the word hallucinogens is still widely
used in the literature I personally
choose not to use it and that&#39;s because
the term hallucination has a negative
connotation and it&#39;s often used in
pairing it with psychosis in a psychosis
one has lost touch with reality and they
think that the sensory alterations that
they&#39;re experiencing are real now with
psychedelics one tends to remain in the
knowing that what they&#39;re experiencing
is an effect of the drug they&#39;ve taken
so for an example some common visual
alterations one may experience if this
was your reality if this was the world
you were looking at under the influence
of a psychedelic you might see light you
might see colors have brighter
luminescent like light is shining
through the colors you might experience
color alterations so they can look
different the colors might not be real
you can lose visual acuity so everything
you&#39;re seeing might be a little bit
blurry you might see geometric patterns
and movement coming from whatever it is
you&#39;re looking at and more often than
not people report this as visually
aesthetic and pleasing and entertaining
this is why I choose not to call them
hallucinogens but psychedelics that term
was coined by a psychiatrists and it
means mind manifesting another common
reported subjective effect of these
drugs is increased insightfulness
participants report the ability to see a
connection between emotions and people
and experiences in their life but they
were not able to see before they report
feeling a wide variety of emotions and
even the harder emotions like sadness
fear and anxiety they later report that
it was beneficial to experience them and
they learned something from them
unity people report feeling connected to
all of humankind through time and space
race and religion nation and border
people feel connected recent research
from Johns Hopkins University showed
that in a controlled setting with
healthy participants when given a
moderate or high dose of psilocybin 78
percent of them reported it to be among
the top five experiences of their life
in a year later 94 percent of them still
agreed top five experience in my whole
life they also reported increased life
satisfaction well-being and openness to
experiencing life now I&#39;m not saying to
go home and take a psychedelic this
weekend don&#39;t say that don&#39;t think that
we&#39;re just looking at what the evidence
is showing us about the potential about
this class of drugs when they are taken
correctly but the research hasn&#39;t only
been done with healthy participants by
1965 before this class of drugs was
illegal over 1000 published clinical
studies in over 40,000 participants
suggested beneficial effects a
psychedelic assistant therapy for common
psychiatric disorders
now since the 60s our regulatory and
research methods expectations have
changed when it comes to clinical drug
trials but recently three top research
universities in the States have
published Phase two clinical trials
using psilocybin assistive therapy to
treat depression and anxiety related to
cancer so they&#39;re not treating cancer
the treatment depression and anxiety
related to the cancer experience all
three studies all participants show
decreased depression anxiety six months
after their treatment this breaks our
current mental health paradigm we
currently do not have a single
fda-approved
antidepressant that has rapid or
long-term effects
so I remind you the power of experiences
in our mental health we have recently
discovered that our experiences have the
ability to change at the molecular level
and I wonder is it possible that the
experience of psychedelic assistive
therapy can be healing us at a molecular
level is it possible that the long-term
behavioral effects in the long-term
symptom reduction that we&#39;re seeing
after psychedelic assistive therapy
could be happening at the molecular
epigenetic level I don&#39;t know the answer
to this yet this is what I hope to find
out in my research over the next couple
of years now I know I&#39;ve talked about a
lot today but if you can remember one
thing from my talk this as a society if
we choose to harness the power of the
connection between our experiences and
our neurobiology we may be able to bring
in a new era of mental health thank you
