on a Tuesday afternoon a few years ago I
hypnotized a man to kill another human
being a few of you might be wondering
right now why I would do such a horrific
thing on a Tuesday afternoon it came
from the fascination of an old murder
case in 1951 a young man entered a bank
in Copenhagen he wanted to rob the bank
but something went wrong and he shot and
killed two of the employees he then fled
the scene and when police found him they
thought he had a weird smile on his face
and fairly quickly they came to the
conclusion that he must have been
hypnotized to commit the crime which is
an interesting conclusion for 1951 later
two psychiatrists both confirmed that
the man had in fact been hypnotized to
commit this crime police went and
searched and strangely enough found the
accomplice that hypnotized the robber he
became known as the guardian angel the
fascinating thing is both of them were
sentenced to life now it&#39;s generally
considered impossible to hypnotize
someone to do something against their
will so fast-forward to 2015 I set out
to prove that in fact you cannot have
such influence over someone else now I&#39;m
a Mentalist and a hypnotist in Denmark
and for the past five years I&#39;ve had a
TV show in Denmark where I do
psychological manipulations on
volunteers from the general public
my biggest manipulation so far was to
recreate this 1951 murder case a young
man volunteered for my TV program he had
no clue of what would happen to him
my team and I took him to a shooting
range where we told him that he would
become a better shooter he believed that
I asked him to shoot around and he was
terrible and then I took him inside and
then I set him down and then i
hypnotized him I said Casper because his
name was Casper
close your eyes and listen to my voice
just like that yes because in a minute
you&#39;ll do everything as I say because I
will be your guardian angel they&#39;ll be
under my command and no matter what
happens you will do the job exactly you
will do the job he came out again and
shot another round and he was fantastic
or he was much better and then we
wrapped the whole thing up and he
thought he was done for the day that he
just needed to do some press photos at
an art gallery in reality a whole new
setup was waiting for him there
complete with actors simulating being an
art gallery an art owner and of course
we had hidden cameras everywhere when he
arrived I got my cue I called him up I
said Casper because his name was Casper
Oh this is Jan close your eyes and
listen to my voice because I am your
guardian angel now the two of us you and
I will make the world a better place
open your eyes and look behind you as a
bag take the bag around your neck look
inside you&#39;ll see the gun that you used
early on the day grab a hold of the gun
feel the power inside yourself because
you and I will make the world a better
place yes you&#39;ll do exactly as I say
inside the gallery there&#39;s a lot of
money and you&#39;ll need that money so we
can make the world a better place now
feel the power feel the courage inside
yourself so we can make the world a
better place no matter what happens you
will feel the power and the courage
inside yourself to do the job what will
you do if somebody comes between
you and the money and he replied I&#39;ll
shoot them I said exactly do the job he
went inside pointed the gun at the
gallery owner he said give me the money
give it to me I know you have it give it
to me now the gallery owner went out to
the back just as we planned and send out
the security guard he came down the
stairs and his 19 year old medical
student did not shoot him once no he
shot him three times
it was fantastic it was amazing we made
TV history
we actually just made history because he
shot him of course it wasn&#39;t real
bullets in the gun
I knew that but he did not know that at
all he shot in his reality he shot and
killed a man in his reality he took the
life of someone else I made him shoot
another person I made him take the life
of someone else I made him shoot and
kill another human being I made him
believe that he shot another man later
that evening I arrived at my hotel room
shaking because I realized what I had
done I had made an honest human being
bad I had made a man kill another human
being and to be quite honest that wasn&#39;t
a good feeling at all not at all so I
just sat there at my hotel room staring
into nothing for a couple of days I
couldn&#39;t sleep and doing all of this at
some point I can&#39;t remember when I
started laughing because I remembered a
quote from an angle to a good friend of
mine spider-man and he said with great
power comes great responsibility with
great power comes great responsibility a
cheesy movie quote gave me an epiphany
I love that word so what is great power
I think it&#39;s the ability to influence
others and we all have some point in our
life but we have the ability and the
power to influence someone else now you
may not be a Mentalist or a hypnotist as
I am but you have the power in the
boardroom in your classroom towards your
friends your family your partner or
maybe you have kids I have kids three of
them my greatest power is over my kids
it&#39;s my responsibility that they become
good citizens of the world I think about
it a lot I really do because it is my
power to influence them in the right way
I think about it how I leave them in
which situation I leave them because I
know that eventually they will influence
other people in their lives so I truly
hope that someday when their old man is
not around anymore
they&#39;ll watch this video of me standing
right here in front of you
and they can say to themselves that the
mother and the father did a good job of
raising them when you realize that you
have this power two words are over
someone else what will you do with it
think about it carefully because you
might change the life of someone Oh and
just on a side note maybe don&#39;t pick up
the phone if I call you
[Applause]
