it&#39;s
you
thank you so much for having me here
I&#39;ll be your your English speaker for
the day so before I move on I want to
point out there gonna be little numbers
in the corners of these slides those are
all latitude longitude so every one of
these places you see I put those there
to remind you that these are actual
locations in the world that you can go
and visit and if you pay attention to
them you might actually notice something
over the presentation so I grew up in
the Midwest of the United States I grew
up in Minnesota and my parents would
take me on these long road trips or it
was like 6-7 hours between stops and
when I was 12 we went on a road trip
that that sort of changed my life and
set me on the path that I&#39;m on now so we
went to Spring Green Wisconsin to a
place called the house on the rock and
so the story behind the house on the
rock is that there was an architect who
wanted to work for Frank Lloyd Wright
and Frank Lloyd Wright told him I
wouldn&#39;t hire you to build a cheese
crate or a chicken coop and so dejected
and angry this guy went and he built his
own version of a Frank Lloyd Wright
house that&#39;s kind of strange frank lloyd
wrong kind of construction and besides
that he started collecting things and
over time this place grew into something
strange and amazing and so inside of
this place the house on the rock was the
world&#39;s largest carousel the world&#39;s
biggest collection of carousel animals
it had a Hall made to look like it went
on forever and it had a sculpture of a
squid fighting a whale that was the size
of the Statue of Liberty and as a
twelve-year-old
I could not believe what I was seeing I
was amazed and completely filled with
this sense of awe and wonder and so from
this experience it was a fairly straight
shot to what I do now which is atlas
obscura so at its heart outlet obscura
is a collection of thousands of places
all over the world
unusual wondrous and often hidden places
places that sometimes people don&#39;t
realize are right next to them maybe a
few miles from where they live and so we
try and
bring this sense of joy and amazement
about what is in our world to everybody
and I think that we&#39;re in an interesting
time right now and actually that talk on
cybersecurity sort of touches on some of
this so in the Victorian age during the
Industrial Revolution the Victorians
became absolutely obsessed with ideas of
wonder and the otherworldly they were
obsessed with druids and ghosts and
fairies and it&#39;s because I think they
wanted some sense of mystery and awe in
the world to counterbalance the feeling
of incredible change and technological
progress around them and I think we&#39;re
in a moment where we&#39;re also all seeking
a certain sense of beauty mystery and
Wonder in the world and so we started
out as obscura to try and provide that
so we try and give people this sense of
awe and Wonder and we do in a few ways
we throw events all over the world this
is at the Explorers Club in New York
where we were showing off some of the
things that they have in storage we take
people on trips this is in Bulgaria to a
place called Beluga it&#39;s sort of what I
would call the greatest abandoned
communist monument in the world and
there it&#39;s a rich category uh-huh and we
wrote a book so last year we published
our first book a sort of distillation of
all of our favorite places and it was
received very well it was number one on
niro times it was number one on Amazon
for a couple of weeks and so I think
that was an affirmation for us that
people are hungry for this kind of sense
a sense that the world is not all been
covered if there are still stuff to
discover and to find so the most
important thing about how samskara is
that it&#39;s it&#39;s built by you it&#39;s built
by local explorers it&#39;s built by people
who decided to take a left turn instead
of the right they take every day and
then found something amazing and then
they send it in to us and that is house
obscura has been built over the last
nine years so what kind of places do
people share with us so it&#39;s a wide
variety I&#39;m gonna give you a few
examples so the Eiffel Tower would not
be a good example but the secret
apartment that Gustave Eiffel built at
the top
the Eiffel Tower and hosted luminaries
like Thomas Edison 40 that&#39;s an atlas
obscura place this is a place close to
my heart this is in Peru it&#39;s called the
Quechua Chaka or the last Incan bridge
and this is a bridge that is remade
every year by the four villages who live
around this area they come together and
they weave this bridge entirely out of
grass and they&#39;ve been making it this
way every year for hundreds and hundreds
of years going all the way back to the
Incan Empire this is in Turkmenistan
this is a place called the gates of hell
and it&#39;s not it&#39;s actually not a natural
phenomenon it is an industrial accident
it was created in 1971 when a Soviet
natural gas drilling rig showed up they
punctured through the top of the desert
the whole rig fell in created this
300-foot wide hole they had another
problem which is that it was leaking
deadly natural gas so they did what I
think they felt was the sensible thing
they set the hole on fire they thought
it would burn for maybe a few weeks or a
few months it&#39;s been on fire for 40
years so that is that is the kind of
place that we we get and one a little
closer to home
this is not far from here this is in in
Florence and it&#39;s around the corner from
the new feetsies so basically on the
other side of that block there&#39;s the
history of Science and Technology Museum
and in this museum next to the
lodestones and the armillary spheres and
the telescope&#39;s is a tiny human fragment
in a little glass egg
this is Galileo&#39;s middle finger and so
this was taken from his body about a
hundred years after he died by an
acolyte and has made its way to this to
the museum and whether it&#39;s you know
pointing to the heavens where Galileo
saw the beauty of God and in math and
science or pointing somewhere else you
know I think is for the viewer to decide
but why does any of this matter in a
sense why should any of this weirdness
matter to the people in the room it&#39;s
interesting fine and good but what&#39;s
what&#39;s sort of the the point of it and I
think there is something
we can all take from this there&#39;s a word
that was recently coined a locater
plexus and it means other wonder and
it&#39;s the sense that I think we&#39;ve all
experienced when you&#39;re somewhere new
you&#39;re traveling and everything seems
amazing even the street lights and and
trash cans seem incredible and your
brain feels like it&#39;s coming alive that
sense of other one or the kind of new
eyes you get when you travel has
actually been fairly well confirmed in
science so when you travel it improves
your problem-solving the Journal of
Psychology found that people who
traveled were 20% more likely to solve a
given computer problem it increases your
faith in humanity you meet other people
and you get the sense that a we&#39;re all
kind of the same and so you have this
general increase that people are good
and it&#39;s really good for your creativity
another journal article found that
people who lived abroad were much more
creative in their writing and in coming
up with novel ideas so all of this is is
fine and good but it&#39;s also a little
annoying it&#39;s a little annoying that
constantly tell people travel is good
for you it&#39;s like saying being rich is
good for you like yeah totally but like
we can&#39;t all be traveling all the time
and here&#39;s the thing about saying travel
is good for you it&#39;s true but it&#39;s also
wrong think about the business traveler
think about someone who flies halfway
around the world stays in the radisson
goes to conferences gets coffee at
Starbucks every morning and flies home
they have not the travel wasn&#39;t
particularly good for them it was a part
of their job it&#39;s fine but it he didn&#39;t
do the thing that all of those studies
are talking about that&#39;s because what
they&#39;re really talking about is
something else they&#39;re talking about
curiosity they&#39;re talking about engaging
with a new world finding new experiences
going on new adventures and that&#39;s
something that you don&#39;t actually have
to get on a plane to do necessarily so
as we shift the focus from travel to
curiosity a couple of things become
notable one a recent Harvard Business
Review
overview found that curiosity is as
important as intelligence in predicting
entrepreneurial success curiosity also
makes you more tolerant of ambiguity
ambiguity and I think in our age as I
talked about previously in an age of
increasing complexity and uncertainty
being able to see things in shades of
gray is an important survival skill it&#39;s
a skill that helps you navigate
appreciate and understand the world and
luckily we can build curiosity because
if you take that example of the business
traveler who&#39;s getting nothing from his
travel the reverse is also true if you
can force yourself to find new paths
even in familiar spaces if you can force
yourself out of your sort of comfortable
environments you can create that sense
of allo catalysis that that feeling of
other wonder that the world is new and
interesting and beautiful even in places
that you know as well as the back of
your hand this is probably the single
most important insight of Alice obscura
so you know I&#39;ve been doing this for for
a number of years and we get dozens and
dozens of entries in every day people
saying there&#39;s this incredible thing
that maybe you didn&#39;t realize was there
and I thought after a while it would
sort of go away like we just you know we
all the good ones would be gotten and
what&#39;s happened is more and more I find
that things close to me close to where I
live maybe a few miles from a place I
know very well have something in them
that I cannot believe was there and one
of the comments we receive most often is
this is two miles from my house how did
I not know about this so I&#39;ve become a
deeper and deeper believer and the idea
that the wondrous the beautiful the
magical are close at hand and I have a
few kind of tricks to to find and
explore to help me break those patterns
that we all get into the kind of
blindness you get into when you walk
down a city street I mean I&#39;m here in
Verona as a traveler so to me it&#39;s like
it&#39;s this incredible unbelievable space
and I&#39;m sure everyone who lives here you
have to walk around you have to get to
work and it sort of starts to fade into
the background but there are some tricks
to
force yourself to see anew so I like to
use either a coin or a dice to force
myself to get lost and it&#39;s a little bit
of a cliche but the beautiful thing
about being lost is you really see you
really pay attention to your
surroundings suddenly your your nerves
go up and you think okay what am i what
am I looking at
I also encourage people to act like a
tourist it&#39;s something that it&#39;s hard to
do especially if you live in a town I
live in New York oh there&#39;s a lot of
tourists there but sometimes it&#39;s worth
taking a weekend and going and doing the
kind of corny things that you think of
as tourist activities and you find that
you don&#39;t know your city that well at
all in fact there&#39;s whole parts of its
history that are unfamiliar to you this
is a personal favorite it won&#39;t work for
everybody but I&#39;m a big fantasy and
science fiction nerd so I sort of turn
whatever environment I&#39;m in into a kind
of a fantasy novel so I an alleyway is
filled with with tiny goblins and a door
leads to a secret underground Kingdom
it&#39;s for me it&#39;s just a way of engaging
my creativity which then in turn makes
me want to find out the real histories
of these places and we need when you do
this when you start to treat your city
in this way like a foreign land like a
an amazing place that you&#39;ve traveled it
begins to open up and you find it be
kids creates a kind of feedback loop you
realize that there are all these hidden
corners all over and you you start to
really feel them calling you you want to
go investigate something that someone
told you about that&#39;s you know just
outside of town and and so as that as
that feeling kicks in the world really
opens up you know what started to feel
maybe like a small you know town what
started to feel sort of claustrophobic
suddenly feels like it has endless
possibilities I mean I I like to travel
I like to go all over the place but I
could stay only in New York or I&#39;m sure
only in Verona and spend a lifetime
exploring and discovering new and
incredible places within it and within
this slide deck I&#39;ve sort of hidden a
small secret and maybe some of you have
noticed or recognized things along the
way but every image I&#39;ve shown for about
the last 20 images is a place within
two maybe three hours from here there
are all places that you could get to in
a day so every single one of those
slides is somewhere that you could
explore today tomorrow and and I just
think that that is a really beautiful
idea this is a place
giant karst cavern not far away about 45
minutes part of the geological Museum
this is artists Ella maybe some of you
know it this incredible arts environment
where everything is made out of sticks
or stones only natural materials are
allowed that&#39;s about two hours from here
the Gigante Giant Bomb ravaged remains
of this huge statue of Neptune that&#39;s
about three hours from here it&#39;s
apparently I just found out today that
it&#39;s it&#39;s in trouble it needs to be risa
ported and so people should go there
tell everyone about how amazing it is
and hopefully it can be preserved this
is the monsters of boom marzo is crazy
proto surrealist sculpture park that was
rediscovered by Salvador Dali that&#39;s a
few hours from here that&#39;s at four hours
south this is a giant pink bunny which
was on a slide previously that has been
lying on top of a mountain since 2005 in
art escena and it&#39;s almost entirely
eroded now but just the idea that
there&#39;s been a giant bunny lying on top
of a hill a few hours from here is I
think a good example of how much there
is in the world to discover how much
surprising places there are all around
us so this is a cathedral being grown
out of trees this is a beautiful bell
tower left over from a flooded town
this is IPL pea playground which is this
handmade theme park made by one man over
his entire life these are all just
examples of things that are right here
and there are dozens and dozens more
there are so many I&#39;m gonna end with a
small story which is that when I was
traveling in South America in the
Amazonas region we went to a small town
called gocta that was beneath this
enormous waterfall and they were an
incredibly poor town and they were
really in need of tourism and
infrastructure support and what happened
is that in 2005
a hiker a german hiker was going through
the area and he looked up at this
waterfall and he thought oh it&#39;s a very
tall waterfall I&#39;m wondering how tall it
is so he wouldn&#39;t asked and they said
nah we actually we don&#39;t know so he came
back the next year with surveying
equipment and he measured this waterfall
and it turned out to be the third
tallest waterfall in the world
it&#39;s very German of him till I come back
and bring measuring equipment and so
when we were there when I was there with
my co-founder Josh we went and we asked
the people in in gocta this tiny town
who said you had this incredible wonder
right here literally in your backyard
and why why didn&#39;t you tell the world
about it and I said well you know we
knew it was special but against
everything else incredible in the world
we thought how special could it really
be and eventually we stopped noticing it
we all live at the base of gocta Falls
all of us live next to incredible
unbelievable wonders and we just have to
open our eyes to see them thank you for
having
[Applause]
