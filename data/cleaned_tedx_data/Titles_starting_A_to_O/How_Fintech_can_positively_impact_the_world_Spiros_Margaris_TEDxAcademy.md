I&#39;m actually not only honor I&#39;m actually
very touched to be here with you so I
don&#39;t want to talk much about tech
although I&#39;m a Finn tech expert I want
to talk about people because I tell you
something tech is dead without people
haven&#39;t seen any tech if it&#39;s abused by
people so I want to stress more than the
people side how it can have an impact in
our lives and how we should encourage
tech to be used to help us society now
how do everything start most great
startups the way the ones I know they
start with this with a dream and it&#39;s
wonderful to dream and then to think my
god could it be possible could I
my people my parents were very simple
parents now I&#39;m standing here I was
thinking about this before never so
touched and they wanted to be here and
it&#39;s possible things are possible you
know the things we we are not Mastiff
and the great startups they try to
follow their dreams and I like to think
of startups like surface maybe because
they&#39;re sexy wow if I could do this and
I think most startups like to think of
them is you know Silicon Valley
California I love that seriously and so
you know and startups have a lot in
common with surface because surfing you
fail a lot I mean you because you aim to
get this perfect wave but it&#39;s very hard
enough to do to ride it and and you know
their odds against you especially for me
and but and you take a leap of faith you
do things that we have no clue if you
could achieve it with all the
consequences that come with trying new
things and now I&#39;ll come a little bit
too to the word FinTech FinTech comes
from financial technology the young not
only young people but people think hey I
don&#39;t like the way banking is done now
and I think I could do it better so
friends come together to three people
and they say okay let&#39;s find a solution
outside of the bank to provide better
savings or how can I send money from
Paris to Casablanca and and how can I
make it cheaper how can I make it better
for people and what the nice things
about the FinTech startups is that the
very customer focused and very simple
you know why because that&#39;s they&#39;re all
they have don&#39;t have much money they
don&#39;t have a reputation the only thing
is the customer they get and you know we
all know how hard it is to win somebody
over for your idea so if you haven&#39;t
then try everything to make their
experience from asset management lending
you know to the poor whatever as
pleasant as easy and as cheap as
possible so they think very hard to be
very innovative of course they don&#39;t
want to be bankers it&#39;s not because
bankers are bad but it&#39;s probably those
startups that don&#39;t feel comfortable
being in such a big corporation where
we&#39;re obviously they feel like they
can&#39;t innovate they&#39;re more like these
guys and even that looks cool we&#39;re not
there but you know they think hey we can
do it but you know we forget if we look
from top top down the risk feels very
different so those people take a lot of
risks maybe there&#39;s less to lose but in
the graphic to that they take risks and
that&#39;s encouraging that we have people
who take risks in order to help us all
this FinTech start up a very successful
tech startup basically with that kind of
message they said hey the old system of
overcharging clients is dead that&#39;s how
they shoulders I give an example it used
to be instill is you if you send money
with a one name names with a big
organization it might cost you 10 to 15%
the moment they charge you exchange
rates the moment a person picks up the
money and with those FinTech startups it
might cost only 1% of 1/2 they did
another ad that did another action where
they walked almost naked it seemed to
look naked that just had skin colour
underwear on to show hey we&#39;re
transparent we show what we charge and
we wanted you to know this is a billion
dollar company so you can see not only
they take risk in the proneural risk
they also want to show that they dare to
be different and to dare to be
innovative and this is a little picture
but it gives a little picture in the
middle is any bank you know and this is
only a small picture of established
players around it where you can see any
banking from lending to as I said to
sending money to Robert Wise they will
cover the space and they will provide
you if they&#39;re successful with better
solutions and most banks you know this
is the future that doesn&#39;t mean big
banks can&#39;t innovate but probably will
be together with them because they&#39;re
much more nimble they really they really
care for you I mean care in terms of I
mean they want to win you over
obviously it&#39;s it&#39;s a business but I
think the successful ones it&#39;s more than
business you will think who uses FinTech
FinTech solutions of course Millennials
they&#39;re born 1980 to 95 you would think
they use it yes they do use it
but it&#39;s more than them it&#39;s everyone
Challenger banks and those banks started
out of FinTech
those customers are both 55 because I
have the money but it&#39;s as I said it
said cross everybody will use it as
estate get more established you will be
very used to banking with them or with
Facebook it&#39;s gonna be so normal and you
might bank with your bank if we provide
to those services and the customer focus
you will my bank course with your bank
but it is not only but young and old
it&#39;s something much more important I
think that&#39;s where the legacy if you
remember FinTech hundred years forward I
think the legacy event it will be a
different one not only simple cheap or
better but helping people who are on the
bank people on the bank people are
people who don&#39;t have a bank account who
lived maybe like in Nigeria in some
areas where there&#39;s no branches and the
consequences are not having a bank
account it&#39;s severe because you get a
salary where should we have Wireless
salary you want to build something as
more business you need a loan so it
might be good to have a bank account it
might be good to have a relationship
with somebody who says I believe in you
it serves us all and the beautiful thing
about this and pacer is called the
service were not with a smartphone that
was any phone with a Nokia with in all
Nokia you were able to transfer money to
receive money that&#39;s empowerment it&#39;s
fantastic and from being non-bank than
becoming on the bank and the next step
it will be to live
hopefully live we are so accustomed to I
think yeah it&#39;s very important then we
have something worse than on the bank
the unbanked refugees they have no
identity there&#39;s no bank account and
imagine how hard it is for those people
it may not even dream of a bank account
to to start a normal life and you know a
lot of them more successful startups in
the world were built by immigrants so
some of those unbanked people here
hopefully a lot of their children might
be our future so we should provide for
them so what we do in the FinTech space
through blockchain technology we give
them an identity there&#39;s something that
companies together with governments they
give them a credit card on the credit
card acts as a bank account so when they
when they come out of of of this awful
life were there no identity they become
underbanked but it&#39;s a first step you
know so when they get a job they can say
transfer the money to this account they
can provide better for the children I
mean it&#39;s something so important for all
of us that we we strengthened society as
a whole
so for them again basically it&#39;s like we
go to a shop and it says you&#39;re closed
but you want to get in because the
coffee is good because something good is
behind the glass for this under banked
and unbanked people it is like this and
they know it but that&#39;s not something we
should aim for you know under Bank you
won&#39;t find on in Africa on India you&#39;ll
find it among ourselves for instance
through a debt crisis as we know normal
people had normal jobs who had some debt
all son lose their jobs they can&#39;t
provide for payments for the debt but
they have a family so if the government
would tell the bank hey be more
conscious about the situation we have to
find a way there all you the money but
we have to find a way to ease it to pay
so they can feed their children because
that&#39;s a priority I don&#39;t think many
banks would say oh yes it&#39;s a good good
idea because they have a different
business model so but fintechs of course
for them they would be open for those on
banks and and those people who won&#39;t
want to transfer money to the banks will
transfer the money they can the FinTech
account because vintage like in the UK
for instigates them probably one of the
most important winter cups regulators
realized that they can&#39;t really change
the big institutions but by encouraging
the vintage to flourish they changed
banks because you build the competition
you know you know that&#39;s the best way
and the same here if if the government
can&#39;t do it by telling banks okay we
have to be more reasonable or we have to
look for solutions for the underbanked
then fantasy it&#39;ll help because they&#39;re
happy to help even if it&#39;s all of their
own interest but they&#39;re there
I lived in America so long so I didn&#39;t
take a soccer game at the baseball I
think like in baseball it&#39;s not only
about winning or for company about
making money fans one identify with
cooperation with identify with with the
team the means you have to show some
values and imagine if it&#39;s a big
institution you would show that you care
a little bit more than then it&#39;s
expected from you I think people would
identify with you and if you don&#39;t you
will miss an opportunity of people there
will be your own future as they grow
more established and there will be
people with jumping the opportunity
thank God to allow those seeds to be
filled and to help those people from
rich to poor from people can&#39;t help and
since we can help I think it&#39;s worth to
do it I mean that would be the goal you
know I don&#39;t know if we can reach it and
at least should be the aim by
governments regulators big banks and
fintechs to fill the stadium to let most
of us participate in a better future and
you know I think maybe together we can
turn the sign around from closed to open
I think it&#39;s a dream worth dreaming
