good afternoon I know most of the talks
this afternoon are about success and
progress but I want to talk about
something different I want to talk about
failure in many ways failure is the
f-bomb of our lives we all spend a
tremendous amount of time trying to
avoid failure but is that really
possible I want you to think back to
when you were in school your hand to the
pop quiz raise your hand if you asked
does this count I&#39;m sure many of you go
through a yearly evaluation at work how
many of you have ever asked will this
assessment become part of my permanent
record and then we have family how many
of you have ever considered what will my
family think of me when I make this
decision we are all driven by numbers
data reports and reviews in this college
acceptance and corporate ladder world we
are driven by failing fear failure
causes students to stay up until three
o&#39;clock doing their homework and in many
cases causes executives to lie cheat and
steal so what does failure mean to you
is it I didn&#39;t get the grade I wanted is
it my boss criticized my work and she
yelled at me is it I got a five percent
raise but damn it I deserve more so I&#39;d
like to take a moment we close your eyes
please I&#39;d like you to think about a
failure in your own life a big epic
failure think about what it felt like
what it looked like how it affected you
how it affects you now hang on to that
memory okay open your eyes we&#39;re going
to come back to that a little bit later
hmm allowing failure to overrun your
life can be completely debilitating a
failure at the top of the food chain can
start a war it can ruin a relationship
it can spur jealousy between friends it
can tear families apart
so let&#39;s deconstruct failure and look at
its component parts and analyze and
reframe it for our purposes so first is
it really failure or is it adversity
that fuels our fears
isn&#39;t it the pushback of unknown factors
that churns our stomachs and causes our
pulses to race and anxiety generated by
the notion that other people succeed
while we alone have a patent one failure
I love this book it&#39;s big among the read
me a bedtime story age bracket but it&#39;s
message is pretty clear everyone poops
and therefore everyone fails the key is
to recognize the challenge the reality
and the adversity of this within our
lives I love this iceberg at the top
that 10 the 10% we see is labeled
success while the bottom says what
really happens and that includes
struggles failures persistence criticism
disappointments like the iceberg
we have been lured to think that success
only happens on the surface but the
reality is that iceberg will not float
without all of that submerged mass we
need failures in order to succeed and
the winner is lala land oh wait a minute
no it&#39;s not
this monumental and epic failure could
have really been a disaster it was
certainly controversial but Jordan
Horowitz the producer stepped forward
and said no no this is not a joke
moonlight has won Best Picture he took
responsibility in the moment how often
do we step forward and take
responsibility for our own failures I
was raised in the Lutheran Church in
Lancaster County Pennsylvania I went to
Quetta chemical classes I&#39;ve forgotten
most of what I learned but the one thing
that I do remember is that doubt
strengthens faith when I first heard my
pastor say that I thought well this
doesn&#39;t make any sense those are two
completely disjunct ideas but as we
discussed it I learned that doubt
provides questions questions lead to
curiosity curiosity leads to answers and
then those answers either support your
faith or breaks your faith in which case
you move on to an alternative so
adversity causes change we learn from
our mistakes not from our successes I
think this is one of life&#39;s greatest
truths 65 years ago univac was installed
at the u.s. department of the at the
Bureau of the census it was the first
computer used at the Census Bureau it
required an entire room it took up 382
square feet and needed 5,000 vacuum
tubes and yet it had less computing
power than this iPhone if it wasn&#39;t for
the struggles of NASA as they tried and
work to miniaturize transistors and just
about everything else as part of the
space race that would have never
happened it was their research leading
to failures and answers and more
research and more fail
and more answers that finally gave us
this technology and now we are the
beneficiaries of that and too often I
think we lose track of this so that&#39;s
NASA story I have two very personal
stories I&#39;d like to share about
adversity and failure in my own life in
the 1970s when I was a freshman at
Northwestern University I arrived on
campus convinced that I was gonna hide
the fact from everyone that I knew that
I was gay I really struggled with that
but I made friends
I learned to sort of accept myself I
started to go out I danced to ABBA
and eventually I came to the point where
I really felt pretty good about myself
and then the AIDS crisis hit and this
mysterious disease moved in that
community in such a horrible way and my
friends were sick and my friends were
dying my grad school roommate Ned Austin
died my boyfriend Hank awesome died that
is Hanks patch and the quilt he was born
in Rising Sun Indiana I went to so many
funerals I was numb but I found the fact
that because I had to go from funeral to
funeral it forced me to put one foot in
front of the other and when the funerals
were over I just kept taking steps and
now at this point I look back and I
realize I&#39;m a survivor I survived a
global health crisis and I lived to see
the day that I got married
so the 80s went on and I finished
back-to-back degrees at Northwestern I
earned a conducting degree and I
couldn&#39;t find a job because no one
wanted to hire me with a master&#39;s degree
and no experience so I got a job as a
waiter I worked at the Pump Room in
Chicago it&#39;s a great place to work and I
kept taking interviews and I kept
working cap taking interviews and a year
went by and still nothing I became the
maitre d at the pump room I was doing
very well
I was unsalaried still no job I was at
the point where I was about to change my
career path to restaurant management and
then someone took a chance on me
Dean Simpson at Northern Valley Regional
High School in Old Tappan hired me and
he was a damn good job and I stayed
there for 31 years and then when I
retired in 2013 a former student became
the chair of music at this school
the master school in Dobbs Ferry New
York and she scooped me right up out of
retirement and so now 36 years later and
two magnificent jobs later I can barely
remember the struggles and the pain and
the failure that I felt waiting tables
at the pump room so those are my stories
I&#39;ve asked you to think of one of yours
all of these situations create stress
and anxiety for us so what are we
supposed to do with that anxiety when we
reach a breaking point what are we
supposed to do when we reach this
tipping point there is a relatively new
branch of psychology called positive
psychology it was championed by dr.
Martin Seligman at the University of
Pennsylvania
positive psychology is the scientific
study of human flourishing as an applied
approach to optimal functioning and one
of its key elements is the idea that we
can shift our perspective when you look
at something with new eyes you ask new
questions and you can get new answers so
what can you do well you can change your
words and you can change your mindset
instead of saying I don&#39;t understand
this say what am I missing
instead of I&#39;ve made a mistake think
instead what can I learn from this
instead of I&#39;m never gonna be good at
this
think maybe I&#39;m on the right track among
the core values and positive psychology
are the ideas of the importance of
relationships acts of kindness and
physical well-being working from a
positive mindset it empowers the ideas
of optimism mindfulness and gratitude in
many ways positive psychology is like
looking at the glass half-full
so let&#39;s look at failure through this
lens of positive psychology and to do
that I want to flip it over and really
define success what is the common
definition of success
hmm well most of the time when we
accomplish something we think wow I did
a great job at that except this one part
that didn&#39;t go so well so a lot of times
our success ends up being what is left
from our expectations after we factor in
our failures so I set out to write a new
formula I thought about this and I
realized that it&#39;s important that we
recognize the experience that we get
from our failures
and the wisdom that we gain from those
experiences so experience magnified by
wisdom to go further I think it&#39;s really
important to include perspective
perspective maintaining perspective
means that we keep goals with in
proportion to the potential you would
not ask your six-year-old daughter to
run a mile but you could ask her to do
that at age 16 positive psychology
teaches us that perspective is malleable
we can adjust our perspective our
perspective can be a positive attitude
experience amplified by wisdom in the
context of a positive attitude can yield
success
I like this formula so much better I
think we are in so much better control
of all of these things we can leverage
the experience that we gain from our
failures we can culture our wisdom and
although it&#39;s difficult at times we can
control our attitude so this is a
symbolic equation this would not stand
up to my math friends of masters but I
think it is important that we recognize
its value in our own lives so here&#39;s my
challenge to you today when you leave I
want you to think about that epic fail
that you&#39;re holding I want you to
process it through this equation and see
what you come up with and what changes
you can make in your life I want to
close with one last story when I got
that job I played in a concert band in
northern New Jersey the ridgewood
concert band and I sat here on the end
of the second row
right next to the edge of the stage I
play clarinet so I&#39;m playing and it&#39;s
very very wonderful we&#39;re playing there
rosenkavalier waltzes by Strauss we&#39;re
playing and suddenly I realized my toe
is caught in the seam of the riser under
my feet and my body&#39;s centre of gravity
is lunging forward because I&#39;m being
very expressive of course in slow motion
I can feel my body lunging at the player
in front of me and I knew I was going to
wipe her out in that moment I knew the
only thing I could do was to use that
foot foot to push myself in a different
direction
sideways and off the stage and so in the
middle of that concert I fell off the
stage and crashed onto the floor it was
spectacular and when we finished that
number the conductor acknowledged me and
said and the clarinets who fell off the
stage was / demersal
so as you can imagine I&#39;ve gotten a lot
of mileage out of this story I try to
tell this to the story before a concert
with any ensemble when I feel they&#39;re a
little jittery
because I know if I tell that story and
they recognize this that no matter what
happens in that concert it&#39;ll never be
as bad as when I fell off the stage so I
want you to reframe your failures take
baby steps think about small changes in
quantity that could be amplified for
change
think about that new formula for success
the only thing you have to lose is your
fear of failure thank you
[Applause]
you
