entomologists liked to joke that we&#39;re
the biologists that have jobs and
there&#39;s some truth to that because
because there&#39;s a lot of pests
humans have been battling against
against bugs for for millennia these
things eat our big destroy our houses
they they bite our children in the night
they eat our food right you know how
many picnics insects have wrecked it&#39;s a
lot it&#39;s a lot and insects have killed
more more soldiers than bullets or bombs
have through disease transmission
insects throughout human history have
changed the tides of war where we&#39;ve
decided to call a nice things like this
but not all insects are pests in fact
just the finest sliver of the insect
community are hurting people the vast
majority and this is true so much of
biodiversity right we always focus on
the pests but so much of the life that&#39;s
out there we couldn&#39;t live without and
so that&#39;s what I study I study how
insects help people rather than how they
hurt people and there&#39;s a lot of ways
and topologists estimate that insects
contribute between tens and hundreds of
billions of dollars annually to to to
the US economy alone how do they do that
well they do things right if you like to
hunt or fish or bird watch think a bug
insects are the are the the basis of
these food webs that that support the
wildlife that we that we appreciate
insects provide services they provide
products and values these are some of my
girls here honey production is a billion
dollar industry we wouldn&#39;t have fruits
and vegetables without these managed
pollinators
insects are nature&#39;s insecticides by
eating pests of crops they shape when
and where you have pest problems by
eating the the the the seeds and the
green parts and the roots of weeds
insects have a have a profound influence
on when and where weeds become a problem
we can use these things right and
insects are a major source of protein
for just about every culture except for
Western cultures and around the world
insects transfer feed into protein
better than any of the livestock that we
currently raise and and and as such are
really important component of human
diets if you&#39;ve ever had crab legs or
Lobster I hate to say it folks but
that&#39;s a big bug but and that&#39;s kind of
the cart that a lot of entomologist like
to drag out whenever there&#39;s whenever Oh
what&#39;s the value of an insect but it the
value of insects to human society
transcends that that very short list I
mean the colors the the smells the
tastes of our world are largely shaped
by the insects that have interacted with
plants throughout generations right
it&#39;s the spices in our cupboards the
chemistry&#39;s the plant create that we
then exploit for our medicines for the
for cents things like this for flavors
in our food that comes as a response to
herb every from insects the colors of
the natural world are attracting
pollinators right we wrap our bodies in
the in the secretions of bugs silk
that&#39;s where it comes from
talk about influencing the path of human
history look up the Silk Road a few
times and everybody&#39;s heard of
performance-enhancing drugs
how about performance-enhancing bugs
everybody was dazed and amazed when the
1992 burs tri knees women&#39;s track team
set new records new
world records after consuming fungal
infected caterpillars that that&#39;s
partially their claim to fame so
tremendous tremendous impact on human
society but how often do we overlook
that or stomp it into the ground just to
hear that crispy Kringle right these
these insects through I just love that
about them right through small
individual actions that are aggregated
and synergize with one another
insects shaped the entire world I
recently my career has led me down a
path where I got to interact more and
more with a lot of farmers that remind
me of bugs and these guys would actually
probably in Gales would probably be
flattered by that so you know the crowd
I run with okay why because through
small suit through small changes to
their farms through through through
individual actions and aggregating and
synergizing these things these
regenerative farmers are literally
changing the world don&#39;t ever don&#39;t ever
underestimate the the power of little
things to to overcome seemingly
insurmountable problems obstacles how
did I get involved with these guys well
I&#39;m an entomologist and what I was
discovering as I was talking with some
of these farmers is that they were
eliminating insecticides from their
operations and that&#39;s not supposed to
happen when you have a pest problem
you&#39;re supposed to react to that right
you&#39;re supposed to to control it what
these farmers are doing is is that
they&#39;re reinventing the system so that
they don&#39;t have problems to begin with
with pests
okay so they don&#39;t have to react they&#39;ve
got it all in built into their system
and this transcends entomology this
transcends pest management they&#39;re there
they&#39;re calling it regenerative
agriculture why regenerative that&#39;s a
it&#39;s an empowering term sustainable
agriculture isn&#39;t gonna cut it anymore
we&#39;ve degraded our natural resource base
to the point where simply sustaining it
isn&#39;t going to solve the kinds of
problems and produce the food that we
need what these guys are doing is
they&#39;re taking their farms and they&#39;re
rebuilding the natural resource base
while producing food key elements of
this instead of focusing solely on
yields or pounds of beef per acre what
they&#39;re focusing on is rebuilding soil
especially soil organic matter the black
dirt that we all see it&#39;s that skin that
covers much of our terrestrial areas of
our planet Wow
so they&#39;re conserving and promoting soil
while conserving biodiversity on their
farms all of the plants insects microbes
fungi things like this animals on their
farm while producing nutrient-dense food
nutritious food profitably those are the
key elements these guys this is not this
is a movement that&#39;s happening unseen
under the radar screen right now across
the planet there&#39;s thousands of farmers
that I&#39;ve now visited throughout every
different scenario that you can invent
of circumstances production
circumstances that you can envision and
the practices that they put onto their
farm to make these systems work very
substantially but they are unified in
high in certain principles okay
principles what are those principles
well we&#39;re going to talk about those
number one they are stop
tillage okay-y tillage degrades organic
matter in several ways and the
profitability of a farm field is
directly correlated with the amount of
organic matter in the soil how does this
happen through erosion when you till the
soil that the water rushes away all a
lot of the topsoil the wind blows it
away over to your neighbor&#39;s fields but
it also eliminates disturbs disrupts the
biology of the system that grows that
soil organic matter and so this is
usually the first step almost always in
in regenerative agriculture they never
leave bare soil the energy for a farm
does not come from a gas can the energy
comes from the Sun and the only way to
capture that is with plants and so when
you have bare soil on their farms what
they were finding is that they weren&#39;t
if they weren&#39;t able to hold the soil
down first off but they also weren&#39;t
able to capture that energy and turn it
into things like crops or animals third
principle some biodiversity is better
than none and more is better than less
why is that
especially with plants because
biodiversity does things it provides
services just like all those services I
just pointed out with insects
biodiversity the life in that system
drives it and the end and what we found
as in science is that biodiversity
scales with how many plant species are
in an environment or in a habitat and
but they&#39;re doing it in agronomically
feasible ways instead of having 30
inches of bare soil between corn rows
they fill it up instead of leaving half
of the season bare soil they put cover
crops out there now they vary their crop
rotations they take those field margins
then they fill them up with species and
then they are in
degrading livestock with their crops
okay and animals and plants insects
microbes all of these things co-evolved
together so this adds an additional
revenue stream in addition to improving
the functionality of those crops
somewhere down the road along the line
we went down this path and this path
said that simplifying growing more
growing fewer species on more land made
you a good farmer and that
simplification of the agro ecosystem has
had profound effects because when you
eliminate the diversity from your farm
you have to replace it with a more input
this is what the country currently looks
like on 10% of the terrestrial land
surface of our country we have three
crop species we had replaced the the
function of hundreds of species with
three and then we maintain the
productivity of that with a lot of
inputs Agrokor you have to replace what
biodiversity did with with agrochemicals
but there&#39;s cracks in the ice
we can now correlate things like my
climate change like pollution the
degradation of rural communities human
health problems biodiversity loss like a
lot of our bees and butterflies we can
correlate those back to how we&#39;re
producing food that&#39;s not to say that I
hate farmers right this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t
this is a what I look at this is I mean
this is an opportunity to solve really
improve our natural resource base while
producing food in the same place at the
same time that&#39;s what these regenerative
farmers are doing insects see the world
much differently than we do each of
those little facets produces an image
and the insects take all of these
different images
these different perspectives and they
combine them into a single image in
their brains to perceive the world
around them to perceive the whole system
that&#39;s what these regenerative farmers
are doing right now instead of
compartmentalizing each aspect of the
farm
they&#39;re combining them into a systems
level perspective I think that that&#39;s
the future of food production what these
guys are doing boldly bravely against
the grain is that they&#39;re solving
planetary scale problems with our food
system thank you very much
you
