AGGA Maury I started my first restaurant
20 years ago it was born out of sheer
passion for food I don&#39;t actually cook
but I don&#39;t know why I went into foot
business well I I started everything
from scratch meaning I did product
development I did hiring I did
purchasing everything okay so I started
with a team of one cook one prep prep is
the guy who helps out hook one
dishwasher server me and my wife so
every time I cook doesn&#39;t make it to
work we have the Pro Shop no cook loops
so I said I cannot live with that it was
so frustrating that I said we have to
scale up the operations good enough
sales came in and I pulled myself I
would never closed shop again so I
started putting in three chef&#39;s inside
of one those were to put up paints in
growing pains of starting up a new
business this picture is very
significant for in our journey in
business this particular item brought us
to where we are today fish head was a
gourmet food yes
niche market very few appreciate patient
but we were able to forget people who
loves food and this is the food that
brought me to mr. Han BC senior there is
just man in the Philippines today mr. C
would frequent my restaurant maybe three
four times a month he particularly comes
in late in the evening when we&#39;re about

to close down say 9:00 9:30
his secretary will call us okay
there was no beeper no cell phone no
emails nothing it was a it&#39;s a landline
mr. C is on his way with some visitors
can he can you hold from closing down
and wait for him
so that that was happening okay all over
again one day when he was with his son
or late dinner he requested me to sit
down with him and said young man you&#39;re
a hard-working guy imagine you have to
extend your closing hours just to cater
to two of us I said no no worries no
worries uncle that&#39;s part of our job so
invited me would you like to join my
mall yes m&#39;lord as the very first mall
in the Philippines first integrated mall
I said we&#39;d love to it was so hard to
get a space there and there&#39;s so much
people there and yet no no come to my
office and then and come to my office
tomorrow I said okay okay I&#39;ll be there
this young 20 year old guy walks in his
office the Secretary was saying you
really have an appointment with mr. C I
said hey I have so you saw me I assured
me to the mr. room and said okay he
called one of his assistants Ricky be a
space in SM Odessa I say no application
needed Noreen
that totally changed our our our
direction in business so this particular
picture is very significant to us
after doing a food court so the passion
to go to other fields of restaurants
it&#39;s very encouraging at that time so
today we have a lineup of stores that uh
that uh that we operated then because of
the globalization because of social
media exposure we thought of bringing in
a reputable brand in Manila and I think
Manila is ready for that so why don&#39;t we
have a Michelin star okay let me discuss
on on the a Michelin star how do you get
it with the history of ian michelin star
started the some road map guide to sell
their tires michelin is a fire company
piece in Europe they started to sell
fires together with a road map and there
there&#39;s our pit stops gasoline stations
and some restaurants ice evolved over
the years it became very reputable that
people were buying just a book for the
list of restaurants and not buying the
fires so after the war they started
doing that just focusing on restaurants
okay it started in France okay and then
the clamor for them to go outside France
they went to New York South America and
most recently in Asia today we have two
legitimate Michelin star restaurant in
the Philippines we brought in team hall
one three years ago when we were when we
were negotiating with them when we
presented our portfolio the first thing
they asked was do you have your hands
full why do you need the franchise
tympole I said because we want to have a
Michelin star restaurant in the
Philippines and said that now we have
the same vision so because of that
vision they gave me him horns rights in
the Philippines then when we were
easily one time we were trying to look
for a good restaurant particularly Milan
the concern said there is a good
restaurant right outside Milan it is the
most affordable Michelin star restaurant
and in a few minutes we were off due to
this restaurant so we met the owners we
discussed with them the interest to
bring them the Philippines so when he
said Philippines
he said Philippines is that in Asia so
it was really a hard sell we have to
invite him over show him around and
where Philippines is the moment he
landed in the Philippines and so what
BGC is happy and ortigas he said we&#39;d
like to have one or two stores here so
those were what those were they be the
selling points that we have to do when
applying for a foreign franchise they
have to see Manila and not hear it from
the news because if it&#39;s a different
story so today we have two Michelin
rated restaurants in the Philippines
next year or this year
i&#39;ma say we&#39;ll have three more
affordable Michelin stars in the
Philippines these are all coming in
second half of this year we we think the
Michelin star restaurants as long as
it&#39;s affordable would work in Manila
not all Michelin stars restaurant will
work in Manila the white leaners
expensive ones they won&#39;t work but I
guess affordable machining stars which
is now the new direction of Michelin
when they awarded a very first Hawker
Center a Michelin star in Singapore so
is the Philippines ready for a Michelin
rating I think in the next five to ten
years
Michelin will come to Manila the last
country they went to last year was South
Korea is it a jalopy that I owe the most
number of Michelin star restaurants now
is in Japan so mutually
now in Asia and I see in the very near
future
the Michelin will make it in Manila so
soon I think we will have a Filipino
Michelin star restaurant latest craze in
America now the talks is Filipino food
would be the next big thing that&#39;s
according to Andrew Zimmern of the
bazaar food be some he has a TV show
it&#39;s a celebrity chef and according also
to
Andrew protein no reservations layover
so me personally I feel that Filipino
food was presented with international
standard headless boneless okay we&#39;ll
make it internationally and I think with
these two guys watching for us we will
be the next culinary star in the world
so we are company now we&#39;d like to think
global and probably put up not probably
it&#39;s already the words we&#39;re putting up
our first story in America so in closing
we evolved from one space to another and
we shouldn&#39;t stop from there we are
working on our first Filipino restaurant
to be open in America and that&#39;s a dream
come true
