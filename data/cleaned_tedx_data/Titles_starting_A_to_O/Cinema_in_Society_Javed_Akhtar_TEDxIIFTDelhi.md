hello everybody everybody can hear me
well I&#39;m talking about cinema and
society we are a nation of movie buffs
so this is very relevant to think and
analyze how cinema influences society
and how society in princess cinema you
see art I mean let me start by stating
obvious that art should entertain but
there is a difference between art and
circus circus&#39; only entertained art has
many more things to do and particularly
cinema because cinema is a kind of a
synthesis of so many arts
it has literature it has visual it has
music it has acting it has dancing it
has every form of art somehow or the
other contributes in cinema but does it
reflect society does it reflect the
aspirations and hopes and dreams of
society their apprehensions and hurts
and bruises I believe that even
mainstream cinema which has no claim
over reality does that one can ask that
if the film is films are not realistic
how can they portray how can they
reflect truth of the society you know
commercial cinema has its own language
like dreams have you know when we sleep
all the parts of our bodies are
functional
except for brain brain functions in a
different manner because if it keeps on
functioning the way it functions when we
are awake how will we sleep so it has a
trick
it changes the language and instead of
thinking shop focus it starts working in
dreams
now dreams don&#39;t come from Marcel moon
they come from the realities but they
turn into symbols and if you tell your
dream to any psychologist he or she will
be able to analyze and tell you why you
are seeing the dream and why you have
seen your dream the same way cinema if
we look at it carefully as a matter of
fact in the light of the list of the
heroes or the lists of the villains was
a list of the hero ins the characters
I&#39;m not talking factor you can write the
socio-economic political history of this
country of last 70 years and more as a
matter of fact if remember in 14th who
is a hero David us
Devdas was the symbol the
personification of the funeral system
that was breathing its last there even a
lover even a rebel
could not think to rebel against the
parents are in the establishment so that
anger was directed towards the self and
there was a glorification in that
society for self-destruction then the
world changed and came the time when we
got independence and we are hopeful and
we were happy and we thought
everything&#39;s going to be fine and right
and the happiness is just around the
corner and wonderful days out the next
page of the calendar and then we had a
rebel star now
the rebel star that we saw later the
rebel image that we saw later you see in
70s this rebel star was different this
rebel star had no problems with the
society with the economic or social
system because this rebel star was
hopeful the only fight he had won with
the few realistic system of his or her
own family
so this star for the first time unlike
Devdas he started telling the parents
the mother or the father or the
grandfather that I will marry Franco and
I won&#39;t marry Soto
that was a rebellion
then in a while the dream shattered the
society realized people rely the younger
generation life that things are not that
hunky-dory happy days are not here and
so on and so forth
and did disillusionment which ultimately
came to her seventies created the angry
young man this was for the first time a
vigilante
a man who had lost because the society
had lost trust in the institutions that
was the time when extra-constitutional
forces were rising that was a time when
the wholes
decisions were being rejected and so on
so forth and that was a time that you
saw on the screen an angry young man has
come but how long you can remain angry
so ultimately you were tired of anger
and comes a cynicism then you see that
the villain who was once upon a time the
villain was the tacos the Zamindar when
we had that remnants of feudal system
then with urbanization the villain
became the capitalist the mill owner
because that was the time of socialistic
pattern of society and then you see that
the villain as urbanization became
denser and the villain was the slumlord
or the urban gangster and lo and behold
within few years this gangster this
urban gangster became the hero that tell
something about the morality for society
then after that the villain was the
policeman the politician which was
unimaginable in 40s or 50s because we
used to respect politicians leaders but
in 80s the villain was the politician
the policeman and in 90s for barrier
vyas reason the villain became the
pakistani terrorist and then we got
tired of him also the law of diminishing
utility was applied on him
and at the moment we don&#39;t have any
melon because today the villain of the
society has said tomb Raider&#39;s
resemblance with us that we don&#39;t want
to face him we don&#39;t want to expose him
as a matter of fact we want to be him so
how can we call him a villain that&#39;s why
we are devoid of villains at the moment
look at the women characters man Chopra
he was a film and Meena Kumari in
minasan out of the world who would cried
the drop of the Hat their husbands will
go on the quota to listen to mudra and
they will sit in the temple and sing
bhajans for a long for the long life of
the husband and so forth now she is
rejected
she is gone the society is aware that
she is no longer a currency but she is
not on the screen also you see it is not
a one-way traffic it is given cake what
happens that there are some they think
but counter to plate they fantasize but
they can&#39;t visualize they imagine desire
but can&#39;t deem the cinema somehow
instinctively understand what they are
looking for and when the guest is right
when the filmmaker the writer of guess
is right the film offers an icon the
film offers a symbol the film offers a
narrative a character and the audiences
decide what we were looking for and has
the best it&#39;s obviously the change is
constant that&#39;s why the hero hero in
everybody changes
you see you used to have Mona darling
used to have Rita we used to have Julie
wherever they gone they are no longer in
the friends anymore because the hero and
used to be the potato Murtaugh sati
Savitri that time some baby needed
somebody like Rita and Miss moon also
but then our hero in became miss Mona
and the society accepted that so now we
don&#39;t we don&#39;t need those vamps and it
is all of it is happening in the society
in cinema is really only reflecting it
then cinema if you die image then you
take the tomato and send a stronger
message to society cinema and so on so
forth in there is a major change when I
joined film industry I was 19 year old I
had joined after my graduation and when
I started writing and should some
producer they said son you are talented
you will become a writer but let me give
you an advice write story which will be
popular in small towns because that is
where the money is there are very few
big cities and the rental theater rental
is so high that we don&#39;t get much money
from the big cities this film should run
in this small town after 45 years this
mantra is standing on its head now they
say that I mean I&#39;m repeating the words
of the producer young producer I won&#39;t
name him that I don&#39;t care if my film
doesn&#39;t get relieved in European Bihar
as long as it is doing well in
multiplexes or big cities and diaspora
likes it I am home safe and dry now this
person is not a sociologist this person
is not an economist but this person
unwittingly unknowingly making a
statement that almost 75% human beings
Indians are redundant and understandably
so because you had to hospital for each
people hospital for poor people hotel
for rich people hotel for poor people
school for each people school for poor
people now you have theta for rich
people and theta3
these multiplexes have offered as a
package deal
something is very good about it
something is not so good good that we
are allowed to have all kind of film
then they become viable bad because the
audience that comes to multiplexes is
not interested in social economic
problems of the country it has happened
for the first time you will notice that
the protagonists of Hindi cinema
in no longer a working person or a poor
person he doesn&#39;t come from working
class in 40 50 60 70 you may not agree
with the intellectual level of those
films but who is the hero
Richa wala taxi driver a farmer a mill
worker a clerk a schoolteacher a lawyer
a doctor now our protagonist doesn&#39;t
work he lives in a palatial house and
when he steps out he&#39;s in Switzerland
because if he&#39;ll walk on the streets of
India some poor person may come in the
frame and he spoiled the party so what
has happened that on one hand we are
achieving variety on the other hand at
the cost of certain realities so Turkey
is economically divided
I mean 75 people don&#39;t mean there are 25
paper that are important and obviously
because that those 75 people will buy in
a single theatre buy tickets in 10
rupees 50 rupees this man will buy a
ticket in 500 rupees so he is worth 10
of them here I have to please one they
all have to please 10 people so this is
a better deal and then I&#39;ll be talking
about them and I&#39;ll be writing about
them and I&#39;ll be filming about them whom
I know well who are my society well my
people
so we are gaining sophistication we are
gaining smartness Venice at the cost of
honesty in depth and it is coming from
the audience I genuinely believe that
audience is a pretty bad influence on
cinema they generally accuse cinema why
won&#39;t it they would make Dobie doesn&#39;t
mean it would love to do that they will
make Madame India Sujata
buns me why won&#39;t they do it you had
done it earlier when they had done it
when the middle class was educated and
sophisticated
you see when again life off with your
packages and here in every package you
have something good and something bad
because there was hardly any in this
tradition so how could you be in middle
class only people who are lawyers
University professors called
teachers doctors civil servants these
are the people who only trust people so
they were necessarily educated but
industrialization when industrialization
happens it creates lots of and Cleary&#39;s
these ancillary I&#39;ll suppose somebody is
making a bicycle so you say okay you
make the tube these main factory doesn&#39;t
produce everything they give small
contracts to different people smaller
people now these people are technicians
these people have learned at the job but
they may not be necessarily educated so
industrialization creates a middle class
which is not necessarily a do it happily
native almost 15 crore people entered
middle-class bracket for the first time
I don&#39;t know there it is right to say
politically correct or not but it&#39;s the
truth
that it takes three generations to lose
culture
when you lose everything then do you are
in you remain with your culture and you
take three generations that it goes out
of you
it takes three generations to gain
culture there&#39;s a last thing to come a
last thing to go things are changing
that&#39;s why the next generation has grown
up and the next generation you can see
the difference et was the tournament
when for the first time a team color
people him and to middle class bracket
and how you can see communalism was not
invented by a tease
it was all always there but it was never
ever Glee or an aesthetic as it was in a
tease and cinema always had made good
and bad films but these were the dark
ages of cinema certainly ecology this
song and the speeches of mr. al-kidd
when he come from the same package you
could not imagine that a man like him
would be the top leader of the country
in 1415 not possible and you could not
imagine circle a career John Oliver
could be a super hit song in 15 it&#39;s the
same thing but things are changing and
I&#39;m hopeful because gradually I can see
that the party I mean the first
generation celebrated the party they
didn&#39;t want to hear anything about
calahonda
and so on who is having let them we are
eating but the next generation and the
next generation that is coming is all
sensitive more receptive the ante not at
the right place now we can see that we
have crossed Kuch Kuch Hota Hai Kahuna
ho pyaar ho gaya so on now the finger
achieving certain depth certain
sensitivity and I am extremely hopeful
and I am extremely proud of this younger
generation which has come now and things
will become better and better
because for them it is no achievement
that they have all the material things
around them and they have the facility
for their parents of grandparents it was
energy but maybe it was an achievement
for me but not for my children they take
it for granted and now they are looking
around they are the people with much
better values much better aesthetics
much better morality than my generation
and that is why I believe that Indian
mainstream cinemas future is very bright
society will see good films and will ask
for better friends thank you
[Applause]
