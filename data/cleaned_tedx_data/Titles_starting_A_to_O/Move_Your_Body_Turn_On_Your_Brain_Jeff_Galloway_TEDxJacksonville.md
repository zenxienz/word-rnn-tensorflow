I want to start with a question how many
of you are looking forward as the
decades
to having less energy and more brain fog
I don&#39;t see many hands out there but I
will tell you that a lot of the people
that I speak with and my work believe
that this is inevitable good news it&#39;s
not inevitable as a matter of fact you
have a great deal of control over
maintaining the energy in your life and
your mental sharpness and as a matter of
fact if you engage in an activity that
was embedded in you by your ancient
ancestors exercise you can even grow new
brain cells at any age take Don McNally
for example here&#39;s a picture of Don in
his late 80s in the exuberant feeling
after finishing one of his 744 marathons
now a marathon is 26.2 miles
I interviewed Don when he was in his
85th year and that year he added 29 new
marathons to his total but the most
impressive thing about Don was his
mental sharpness and his energy level
which were as good as any 30 year old
that I would make meet and I want to be
like Don when I grow up so here&#39;s
another story about a fat lazy kid me
yeah a lot of people assume that since I
ran in the Olympics that when I was in
school I would run circles around the
kids on the playground but that was not
the case and when I was 13 years old my
family moved from Green Cove Springs
Florida to Atlanta I had attended 13
schools during my first seven years and
my academic background was very spotty
in addition to that I had never gotten
into any regular physical activity but I
was going to be attending for my
fourteenth school a very competitive
pressurized prep school where we were
moving
and I was really afraid more about the
physical activity because that new
school required all boys to go out for
strenuous athletics after school I had
no skills
I had no conditioning and I was way
overweight well I fell in first with a
couple of kids who were lazy and tapped
into their Intel and and what it was is
that during the winter quarter you go
out for cross-country because the
cross-country coach was the most lenient
in the school and you could lie to him
you could tell him that you&#39;re gonna run
on the trails in the woods when all you
did is jog to the woods and hide out and
that&#39;s exactly what I did the first week
but then an older kid who had watched me
do this busted me and came up to me and
said Galloway you&#39;re running with us
today and I knew they were real runners
so I had my strategy in place I was
going to reach the edge of the woods
grab my hamstring and let them go but
they were funny and then they started
telling jokes about some of the other
friends that were there and it was all
interactive in nature and fun and then
they started telling gossip about the
other kids well I didn&#39;t make it very
far that first day but each day I&#39;ve
tried to go a little bit farther but
three things happen very quickly first
of all even when I was physically
exhausted I felt better in my head and
in my spirit than I had ever felt
secondly having been the new kid in
class 13 different times I had found it
very difficult to break into the cliques
at these schools from the very first run
that I took with these cross-country
kids they opened their world to me I was
accepted I was trusted I was supported
and and given advice on what I could do
to get better we were all in this as a
team and that totally changed my life
but another and third major area of
change was I
was struggling academically actually
that&#39;s a euphemism I was at the bottom
of my class and I was studying long
hours I just wasn&#39;t focused but on those
runs with the cross country kids most of
whom were on the academic honor roll
I discovered that I was as smart as they
were I had the reasoning power that they
did it totally reset my expectations
about myself and I too found my way on
the honor roll but there were two
questions that started them that
propelled my work in this whole area of
motivating people and empowering people
the first one was how could
after all day long of stress building up
how could ten minutes into the run my
stress would be gone the second question
was even on the days when I was really
wiped out after workouts which were most
of those workouts I could go home facing
a pile of homework very very hard
homework and I could focus on it I could
learn better and I would get better
grades far better than I did before I
started this whole exercise program what
was going on so I started researching I
started studying and what ended up being
the product of all of that is my book
mental training and I accessed a number
of key experts in the field and here
they are I totally recommend their works
their research and the articles that
they have written but I have to tell you
after going through all of them and
other experts the research on the brain
didn&#39;t really get started until the
1990s when safe brain scanning devices
were developed to be able to see what
parts of the brain were turned on and
also which circuits in the brain were
turned on and finally which brain
hormones were induced in order to create
certain situations and it was discovered
early on that exercise turned
on the circuits for a better attitude
for more vitality and for personal
empowerment better than any other type
of activity now I knew that that that
was no surprise to me but it certainly
has been a surprise to a lot of
beginners the area of research though
that surprised the experts was that the
part of the brain that was turned on for
greatest benefit was an area called the
hippocampus the hippocampus is a
critical thinking area of the brain it&#39;s
where learning occurs where memory takes
place and where new growth of brain
cells occurs and of course that&#39;s
particularly important for those who may
have destroyed some brain cells earlier
in life so there are huge benefits
mentally to exercise and the studies
continue to come out every year three
recent studies show there&#39;s a 20% boost
in learning vocabulary words after a
workout as opposed to before a workout
that a person that starts to run three
days later has hundreds of thousands of
new brain cells and in memory test
exercisers tend to score twice the
scores of non exercisers so there&#39;s huge
benefits going on here
but what was it in our evolutionary past
that caused the connection of exercise
and learning and brain activity well it
started 6 million years ago our
ancestors who were chimpanzees by DNA
evidence experienced an energy crisis in
which a climate change resulted in less
food supply and so the primates that
became our ancestors started moving
started going farther on a day-to-day
basis and in the process they found that
the brain that they started out with the
the chimpanzee brain was not ready for
all of the new challenges that they had
to try to find new food
to process new food to remember how to
get back to where they started from and
on and on all types of new challenges so
our ancestors starting six million years
ago started the development of the human
brain it&#39;s an entirely different entity
than the chimpanzee brain which we still
have the human brain allows us to size
up a situation to set up a strategy and
then to move step by step towards
whatever it is that we want to do and as
a result of the exercise you are going
to find the human brain turned on more
and you can tend to stay in the control
of human brain which is then going to
get you away from the negative hormones
that can be produced by the chimpanzee
brain so you have a great deal of
control over your motivation as you move
forward but just remember it was
exercise that actually developed our
human brain which makes us different
than animals are so a lot of you may now
feel that exercise is probably a good
thing where&#39;s your hand if you think
that exercise might be a good thing for
you yeah yeah but how many of you are
thinking yeah but it&#39;s gone to hurt or
I&#39;m gonna be exhausted or I&#39;m gonna puke
so any any of those well I&#39;m gonna take
away that excuse because it never has to
hurt you can start with gentle walking
for five to ten minutes you can do that
and then you can increase every other
day by three more minutes until you get
up to the 30 minute threshold where
these marvelous brain benefits are shown
to occur so you have an opportunity
without puking and I&#39;m against puking by
the way to be able to make some major
changes in your brain and in your
as a result so now comes the fun part of
my talk
it&#39;s the pep talk first of all remember
that our human brain developed due to
exercise so we&#39;re going back to our
roots when we do this and that when we
exercise we turn on the brain for better
learning for better memory and new
growth of brain cells at any age I&#39;m not
going to let those of you past a certain
age get off the hook on this you&#39;re
gonna still continue to grow new brain
cells you will also when you exercise
turn on the circuits for a better
attitude for more vitality and for
personal empowerment that will keep
changing your life for the better as
things go by and finally exercise has
been shown to take the stress hormones
that start to build up and neutralize
them and when you need a pep up and you
get in on your workout you get going on
your workout you&#39;re gonna rev up the pep
up hormones there so your body has a
natural way of taking care of itself so
now is the time move your body and turn
on your brain
thank you
