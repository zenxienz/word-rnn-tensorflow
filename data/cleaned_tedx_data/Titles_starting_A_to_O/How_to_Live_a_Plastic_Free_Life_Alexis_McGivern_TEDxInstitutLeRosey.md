I suffer from a rather odd affliction
this increasingly common condition has a
few incurable symptoms I&#39;m sorry to say
it but I hope you&#39;ll all suffer from it
too by the end of this talk doctors are
still working on the name but they&#39;re
currently calling it plastic it√≠s the
first of these symptoms is like a
superpower I call it the plastic goggles
as soon as I walk into a room my eyes
zero in on any plastic item present
whether that&#39;s a wrapper from a tasty
snack a water bottle or a disposable
fork in a plastic takeaway box I make a
mental calculation multiplying the
pieces by how many people are in the
room and trying to estimate based on
their habits just how much plastic has
been consumed in the previous days I
also imagine where these pieces of
plastic will be in five twenty or even a
hundred years time the second and
probably more positive symptom is what I
call the plastic free goggles which is
walking into a room and identifying
where those pesky pieces of plastic
could be eliminated and replaced with
reusable and sustainable alternatives I
didn&#39;t always suffer from this condition
in fact I lived the first two decades of
my life blissfully unaware of the
mountain of trash I was leaving in my
midst I called myself an
environmentalist but paid little
attention to how those values affected
the way I lived my life I was an addict
consuming plastic and other throwaway
items with fervor because they added
convenience to my life I clearly
remember the moment I decided to stop
using plastic
I was interning at an environmental
organization during University and I
used to wander down to the corner store
during slow times to stock up on granola
bars my favorite snack
one day when I was done eating my
granola bar I went to throw the wrapper
in the trash as I stared at this plastic
wrapper packed full with nutritional
information the company&#39;s logo and a
picture of the great outdoors I suddenly
had an epiphany this granola bar which I
had eaten in less than five minutes
would outlive me my children my
grandchildren my great-grandchildren
long after I&#39;m gone and everything I&#39;ve
done with my life has been relegated to
the annals of history this plastic
granola bar wrap will remain when you&#39;re
in a bad mood you sometimes tend to
dwell on your mistakes for some people
this means thinking about the haircuts
they wish they&#39;d never gotten or the
people they wish they&#39;d never dated when
I&#39;m in my darkest moods I think about
all the plastic I never should have
gotten involved with what happened to
that pot of yogurt I had after my first
day of seventh grade where is it now is
it in a landfill buried deep under
thousands of other pieces of plastic has
it been incinerated it&#39;s toxic fumes
long gone into our atmosphere or worse
yet has it caused harm to another living
creature plastic was invented in its
first form as a synthetic polymer in
1907 but plastic in the form we now
recognize and know like polyester or
polystyrene was invented in the early
1930s
what really ramped up the production of
plastic was world war ii where it was
being used in everything from military
weaponry to automobiles after the war
ended the plastic industry faced with an
overabundance supply of this miracle
material with no real demand began to
get
about how best to use it we assured in a
new age of throwaway living I was
demonstrated in this article in the 1955
edition of Life magazine I want you to
really take this photo in for a second
doesn&#39;t this photo blow your mind
imagine explaining this system to an
alien we decided to change our packaging
to something that is virtually
indestructible to use for just 20
minutes or less plastic is an incredible
invention it has propelled us into the
future forming the basis of our
technological devices improving our
efficiency in the medical field and made
shipping easier and cheaper just to name
a few things but our demand for plastic
is increasingly insatiable plastic
production in 2015 was 322 million tons
in Europe about 40% of that was used
just for packaging and this stuff is
increasingly ending up in our oceans
mostly through poorly controlled waste
sites actually it amounts to about 8
million metric tons entering the ocean
each year that&#39;s the equivalent of one
garbage truck full of plastic being
dumped directly into the ocean every
minute the impacts of plastic pollution
are multi-dimensional I&#39;m going to tell
you just enough to scare you into action
but not enough to completely freak you
out
since plastic is not naturally occurring
in the ocean it can wreak havoc on our
marine species they can become entangled
in floating plastic debris or can
mistake it for food and accidentally
ingest in either choking or leading to a
false sense of fullness plastic can take
up valuable space in the stomach while
offering no nutritional value some
seabirds have been found with up to
3,000 pieces almost eight kilos of
in their stomachs that&#39;s like if one of
us ate 12 pizzas worth of food but was
unable to digest any of it as our global
population continues to grow we&#39;re also
creating more trash in developed
countries were throwing away a whopping
average of 2.2 kilos per person per day
but the impacts of increasing waste
generation are felt more deeply in the
developing world
even though consumption there is much
much lower because there&#39;s a limited
capacity to properly and safely dispose
of waste this can lead to it piling up
around where people live contaminating
groundwater and causing water based
illnesses like diarrhea open burn pits
and leaching of toxic chemicals into
soil can lead to longer term problems
like infertility and cancer as humans we
have a desire to protect each other and
the creatures we share this planet with
the reason why plastic pollution as a
problem is so insidious
is because it doesn&#39;t feel like we are
hurting anyone by using plastic last
year I moved to the Maldives to work on
a project that focused on marine
plastics and waste management on Islands
when I told my friends I was moving they
were all very just picturing me lying
out on beautiful beaches but what I was
really moving for was this this is
garbage island a few kilometers away
from the capital male it is the
recipient island for waste from all over
the Maldives and deliveries are made
several times per day when I visited I
met Akash a Bangladeshi worker whose job
it is to move around the island and set
different piles of waste on fire in
order to make room for new incoming
daily shipments the air there is thick
with a toxic smoke and a cache
complained of frequent dizziness nausea
and headaches after work I don&#39;t want to
show you these photos to upset you I
just want to remind you that over here
in this part of the world were used to
rolling a bin to the
our property and it&#39;s dealt with by
somebody else by the time we get home
from school or work just because you
don&#39;t live near a garbage island it
doesn&#39;t mean your waste magically
disappears once it leaves your sight
your waste may not be dealt with by a
cache but it is dealt with by somebody
imagine if our wastes weren&#39;t regularly
collected from our homes this is what
they would look like after my Eureka
moment with a granola bar back in 2013
something I affectionately referred to
as my plastic ax moment don&#39;t worry
that&#39;s a really bad job I decided to get
serious about tackling my plastic
consumption
I&#39;m quitting plastic i defiantly told my
somewhat apprehensive friends and family
but I already had a reusable water
bottle and I regularly brought my
reusable bag with me to the grocery
store so what else was missing and why
was my apartment
chocolate block full of plastic I&#39;ve
learned a lot over these past four years
and I&#39;d love to share some top tips with
you today thank you
this is my go-bag where I go this goes
it&#39;s a plastic filled world out there
and this is the kit that i armed myself
with plastic free-living doesn&#39;t have to
be a major inconvenience in your life
like any habits practice and a little
bit of patience makes perfect when I
first officially committed to giving up
plastic my first thought was oh my god
what have I done no more Chinese
takeaway but luckily you can enjoy lots
of delicious food on the go simply by
bringing your own container I used this
one because it&#39;s collapsible and it&#39;s
small enough to fit inside of my purse
and this is good not only for that
delicious Chinese takeaway but for
anything where you&#39;d be getting a
disposable container like for leftovers
at a restaurant or for any outdoor food
stall like at a music festival synthetic
textiles like nylon or polyester usually
used in activewear unfortunately really
released tens of thousands of micro
fibers with each wash these really small
micro fibers are too small to be caught
by water treatment plants which means
they have a direct ride right into our
waterways it&#39;s better to opt for natural
materials like cotton but for the
clothes that you already have I
recommend using a garment bag like this
guppy friend you put all your clothes
into it zip it up and at the end of your
wash when you remove it you&#39;ll find a
lining of microfibers all along this
little section here then you can take
them and safely dispose of them in the
bin when I go out to a bar or a club
I&#39;ll bring my own steel cup and a steel
straw the steel the steel cup is a way
for me to avoid disposable cups usually
when you go out to a bar or a club
they&#39;ll serve you in plastic cups
because it&#39;s much easier for them to
clean up but multiply that by all the
drinks for getting in one night buy
every person in the bar and buy every
bar in every city on planet Earth that&#39;s
a heck of a lot of plastics to be
throwing away
actually it amounts to about half a
million disposable cups thrown away each
year making a pile of garbage ten times
higher than the matterhorn this steel
straw is a great visual reminder to a
waiter or bartender that you don&#39;t need
a plastic straw because straws suck our
kitchens can be a massive source of
plastic mostly from over packaged food
and grocery stores I shop at bulk stores
like this one allowing me to refill on
pantry staples like rice or pasta or
even things like washing up liquid or
laundry detergent in refillable
containers which allows me to massively
reduce the amount of plastic packaging
I&#39;m bringing into my home I also bring
small cloth bags for dry goods and don&#39;t
worry there&#39;s lots of chocolate at these
kind of folks stores you can find a bulk
store near you by putting in your
address on this website zero waste home
comm slash app you&#39;d be surprised at how
many bulk stores are popping up all over
the world they&#39;re increasingly growing
in popularity and finally I recommend
changing your personal care products a
bamboo toothbrush and a bar of shampoo
instead of bottled shampoo are the two
easiest switches that have made the
biggest difference in my plastic
footprint and baking soda makes an
incredibly effective deodorant don&#39;t
knock it till you try it
when I was a teenager I used to tell my
best friends
everything sometimes when it didn&#39;t work
out with the boy I called them up and we
discuss everything that had gone wrong
in the relationship I would love to live
in a world where a girl calls up her
best friend and tells her it&#39;s not gonna
work out I saw him drinking out of a
plastic bottle a lot of people ask me
wait a minute
what&#39;s wrong with recycling recycling is
great but it is not a viable solution to
this problem most types of plastic
cannot be recycled and for those that
can like PET bottles
they can only be genuinely recycled once
or maybe twice before they&#39;ve been
damaged too much to be recycled again as
compared to something like an aluminium
can which can be recycled an infinite
number of times
other people ask me wait a minute
don&#39;t governments and corporations have
a bigger role to play in all this and
the answer is yes governments can take
big steps through positive policy
changes like banning or taxing plastic
or incentivizing the use of compostable
or reusable packaging corporations can
also make big changes to the amount and
type of packaging they use or through
financial contributions to build up
recycling facilities in the developing
world however I&#39;d like to refer you to
Newton&#39;s first law of motion also called
the law of inertia an object at rest
stays at rest and an object in motion
stays in motion unless acted upon by
force we can be that force that gets
people engaged and moving from their
resting and infecting all our friends
and family with plastic itis if every
person in this room and every person
watching this video decided to give up
at least one item of plastic and
encourage their friends their families
their co-workers heck even just their
Facebook networks to do the same it
would create a ripple effect of plastic
free ambassadors all around the world
standing up and demanding change big
actors respond to big actions and that
would be pretty difficult to ignore
like any habits plastic free living can
take an adjustment period it&#39;s not going
to happen overnight
and I recommend you take it one step at
a time that first step towards plastic
free living can be a big one like vowing
never to buy bottled water again or it
can be a small one like placing a
reusable bag in your car for the next
time you go food shopping it doesn&#39;t
have to be all or nothing to make a
difference because every single piece
matters once you&#39;ve mastered that first
habit I encourage you to try another one
and another one and another one until it
just becomes part of your daily routine
there have been many times in the last
four years where I haven&#39;t lived up to
this plastic free living ambition
whether that&#39;s when I&#39;m traveling and
out of my comfort zone or when I arrive
at an event totally unprepared for an
onslaught of plastic when that happens I
take a deep breath try not to panic and
remind myself of the good actions that I
know are making a difference choosing to
address your pasta consumption means
coming to terms with the fact that our
actions have an impact on each other and
on our planet every time you vote with
your wallet and choose not to feed that
plastic beast you&#39;re making a conscious
decision about the type of future that
you want we can play a massive role in
chipping away at convenience culture by
demonstrating to others that you can
live a happy fulfilling and fun life
after giving up plastic thank you
you
