it&#39;s been such an inspiring day
wonderful I&#39;m from Wales one of my
favorite words in Welsh is
untranslatable no that&#39;s not the word
its untranslatable in the same way as
your corsola which i front first lived
in Holland as a zealot and I understand
the word to mean that warm cozy
comfortable feeling you get with friends
that can be applied to any situation in
a social situation the day it&#39;s been a
zealot for me but the the word of Welsh
my favorite word in Welsh is here life
and the meaning different people will
tell you it means different things for
me it means it carries a nostalgia a
longing for the things past for home
it&#39;s almost homesickness along for the
things that are lost the things that
have departed the good old days the good
old ways I spend most of my career
looking at the old ways of making
theatre I think of myself as a time
traveller like a ginger doctor who
one day there will be one looking at the
old ways that we used to make theater to
inspire the new looking at the way that
we build theaters used to the way the
companies used to work together the way
that we used to approach text the way
the audience&#39;s have changed and not to
be authentic no one wants autentic in
these original practices if we went back
in time 400 years together and we went
to the theater together you wouldn&#39;t
like it
half the people around you we&#39;re dying
of the plague the teeth were all rotting
out if you didn&#39;t like what I was doing
as an actor you throw food at me food
was expensive not quite as expensive as
here I remember the first time that I
walked out onto an original practice
space it was at the reconstruction of
the theater that Shakespeare and his
actors worked in for 20 years it&#39;s on
the south bank of the River Thames the
Shakespeare&#39;s Globe Theatre it&#39;s an
outdoor theater they would have
performed 400 years ago at about two
o&#39;clock in the afternoon and they would
have been lit by the Sun they did have
indoor theaters too they were less
common and in fact the globe of just
built one and you can go to the theater
and experience what it is to watch a
play by candlelight it changes you it
changes the way that you breathe it
changes the way that you watch changes
the way that you hold yourself standing
in the Shakespeare&#39;s Globe Theatre
you know theatre has changed so much in
the last four hundred years it&#39;s now a
spectator sport
it&#39;s easy for you now you can sit there
in the darkness be entertained and I
can&#39;t quite see you all the lights are
brighter
I can&#39;t see if you&#39;re happy or sad or
enjoying yourself or not
hasn&#39;t always been this way
Shakespeare&#39;s theatre they would have
been in the same light the light of the
Sun a shared life and what that means is
that if I come out on the stage and I&#39;m
playing in Hamlet and I make a joke
you&#39;re more likely to laugh it feels
like I&#39;m talking to you because I&#39;m
making eye contact with you and you&#39;re
making eye contact with me you&#39;re more
likely to cry when I die laughing and
crying that&#39;s what going to the theatre
is that&#39;s entertainment going on a
journey together experiencing something
together and that word together soundin
on song in French the name we give for
Shakespeare&#39;s company these band of men
and they were men because women weren&#39;t
allowed to act on the stage the work
together for 20 years they&#39;ve been
described as Shakespeare&#39;s understand as
has never been seen before or since I
was fascinated by that idea and I made a
theatre company that worked in that
wedding we brought the same actors
together again again and again the
things we shared I had wonderful friends
and lost wonderful friends Peter broke
the theatre director once said if a
group of people were to get together and
devote themselves utterly to realise the
works of Shakespeare what an
extraordinary group of people that would
be think about the company that
Shakespeare kept for 20 years the same
people every day 300 days of the year
they would have known each other
terribly well wonderfully well the
reliance on each other
we adapted our company towards a modern
climate that&#39;s the point of original
practices not to be how it used to be
but to see how we can change awards the
modern how we can take from the art to
inspire the year many were craftsmen
they worked with their hands literally
actually because one day they turned up
to the theater and the gates were locked
the tenant the landlord
they were tenants to a plot of land
where their theater was and he decided
to raise the rent it was too much for
them so what did they do they didn&#39;t
give up they went to the space at night
took the theater apart carried the wood
across the river found a new piece of
land and built their own theater with
their own hands they didn&#39;t approach
their work as a job to be done that a
craft to be honed and they made it
themselves they wouldn&#39;t be handed a
copy of a play
they&#39;d have to write it down at
themselves the original practice of cue
Scribus it can make you working terribly
terribly first a to script well what is
it we it&#39;s very like in music if you&#39;re
playing fourth violin in a 72 piece
Orchestra you don&#39;t carry around all
seven to two parts the other 71 parts
are being taken care of by the other
musicians you carry out your part the
focus it gives you makes your work
concise it&#39;s the same with Shakespeare&#39;s
company you&#39;re playing the key scale in
Romeo and Juliet you die halfway through
the play there&#39;s no point when you&#39;re
writing out your lines to write out the
second half of the play you&#39;re dead
someone else is looking after that
there&#39;s no point in writing out as soon
as they&#39;ve you know then someone else is
looking after that there&#39;s no point in
writing out the speeches that you don&#39;t
say in the things that you are in you
right now
the accuser when to speak the accuser
when to enter in and takes it and what
you say you learn it fast they were said
to have up to 40 plays in their head to
any one time they would do a new play
every single day they perform at about
two o&#39;clock in the afternoon they get
the lines for the next play later that
day
and some people think they would have
learned the whole part of the night it&#39;s
not possible learn a whole part in 24
hours it may be in fear doing it every
day they haven t practice changes your
way of being then memories must have
been muscular inflated so well and with
little rehearsal time I tell you and
when you when you use Q Street practice
it makes you listen because you
literally don&#39;t know what the other
person is gonna say when you work
together regularly you trust you trust
that the other person that you&#39;re
working with is gonna do right and gonna
do well you start to learn how they&#39;re
going to respond to the situation you
listen so clean keenly not just to what
they&#39;re gonna say but how they&#39;re gonna
move and where they&#39;re gonna move next
to they don&#39;t have time to plan it they
don&#39;t have time to rehearse like we do
these days but eight weeks they respond
in the moment they listen to each other
we forgotten how to listen that way to
listen to each other&#39;s body language if
you listen differently to because the
actors spoke differently the original
practice of accent of pronunciation you
go online you can go online later listen
to some Shakespeare Shakespeare for the
last hundred years has been spoken in
the right accent the accident
of the BBC of received pronunciation to
be or not to be that is the question
it&#39;s so different from how Shakespeare
used to sound and we can work it out
pretty close they used to spell a lot
more eye things to speak so we go back
to the old text there are accounts at
the time of what the accent sounded like
and then some of Shakespeare&#39;s rhymes he
worked so much in Rome the rhymes don&#39;t
work so well anymore so we know that the
accent must have changed we know that
the answer must have sounded more like
to bear or not today that is the
question
no is the winter of our discontent made
glorious summer by this Sun lark
shall I compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the Darling Buds of
May and summers lease hath all too short
a date that accent of Elizabethan London
of Shakespeare&#39;s London spread around
the world and it&#39;s the great-great-great
great-great-great great-great-great
grandmother of pretty much every English
accent today so the right accent for
speaking Shakespeare is your accent if
you wanted to speak Shakespeare&#39;s craft
he came to rhythm there was so much
music in Shakespeare Marlowe the man
that was Shakespeare before Shakespeare
he came up with this great idea there
was a type of poetry that has a
particular type of rhythm in it
it&#39;s the rhythm that we all speak we
still speak today when we speak English
a de dum de dum de dum de dum de dum
rhythm I dropped my phone and cracked
the screening today
you carry that rhythm with you every day
but you have in your heart do it now
feel
it&#39;s a human sounding rhythm and Maha
realized that if he gave his characters
this rhythm in their speeches then they
would sound more heightened because
they&#39;re speaking in poetry but they
would sound more natural so the rhythm
of Marlowe&#39;s speeches go to Dante dum de
dum - dum - dum de dum de dum de dum de
dum de da de dum de dum de dum de dum de
darlin on the Shakespeare well he took
this idea and he ran with it his
speeches would go - dum de dum - dum de
dum da da de dum de dum de dum de dum de
dum de dee dee dum de dum de dum and
everyone go what was the dee dee because
he knew you know well when we speak we
we we stop we stop we&#39;re not fluent we
hesitate we pause and he realized that
if he manipulated this rhythm and his
characters would sound even more human
whilst still selling heightened was them
still speaking in poetry and you get the
half way through his career and the
rhythm of his speeches goals - dum de
dum de dum de dum - dum de dum de dum de
dum de dum dum dee dum dee dee dee dum
dee dee dee dum dee dum de dum de dum
dee dum dee dee
they don&#39;t go down to talk to Tom did
up-to-date he did on the DVD they began
to ddddd
dad he played jazz with this rhythm he
manipulated to simulate the heartbeat of
his characters as he made the rhythm
fluctuate it tallied with the emotional
heart of the characters that were
speaking and his actors they pick up on
this every single new once it was their
job we we don&#39;t you can&#39;t see this on
the page you have to lift up the hood
you have to look at the mechanics
underneath we don&#39;t have this daily
practice the Jazz mechanics of shakes
please craft he was a craftsman he&#39;s
called a playwright we spell that word w
RI ght you know the other place we find
that word shit right think about the
craft that goes into making a shit the
time science you wanted to be a
craftsman in Shakespeare&#39;s time you had
to be an apprentice to a craftsman you
wanted to be an apprentice there to make
your own tools
Shakespeare&#39;s tool was the quill you
want to make a quill you have to find
the Swan and pluck a feather this one&#39;s
a mean
after you run away you sharp from that
quill get some ink find some paper
papers expensive too and you go dip dip
dip
scratch scratch dip dip dip special
scratch did this restaurant stretch you
have to be here or not it&#39;s hard it&#39;s a
craft that is honed he crafted heart
into word and not words to be studied
words to be learned by heart words to be
spoken words to be hard
the words to be shared ideas to be
shared the old ways and the old days
they may not be the best ones that they
can teach us then they can inspire us
for the new plan for the future
