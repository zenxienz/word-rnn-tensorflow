the factories of the future the factory
of the future is gonna contain an human
a dog and the robot a human to feed the
dog a dog keep the robot away from the
human other or to do the work well kind
of instead of our instead of a dog we
will have the suit of the future with
sensors this suit is gonna keep the
robot away from the human
so the incorporating smart robots in the
factor of future we are facing some
challenges those challenges are being
demonstrated in the following video
segments imagine you are a worker on the
shop floor thinking how to make
manufacturing in Europe more competitive
and flexible imagine how much more
efficient it would be if you could work
side-by-side with the robot
but the robot is bolted to the floor
blindfolded and is only allowed to move
a work when it&#39;s behind a steel fence
the call robot project brings the future
of robotics to the factory today through
the use of collaborative and mobile
robots
homo BOTS provide mobile manipulators
that can safely reach any location in
the factory floor autonomy to grasp
tools and parts and deliver them to the
worker flexibility to adjust to the
manufacturing needs safe and intuitive
interfaces so the operators can interact
and collaborate with robots in a shared
workspace using it as a tool without
programming so this is a project that I
am working on I am trying to work on two
challenges the first one is the robot is
blindfolded the second one is the robot
is only allowed to work behind steel
fence
so this is my work collision-avoidance
for collaborative robots the idea is we
have the serial robot and I were a
sensor I can&#39;t close up to the robot the
robot avoid collision with me so I asked
my professor to come and see the robot
he got shocked he said Mohammed slow
down the robot is very fast it cost
seventy two thousand euros he wasn&#39;t
concerned about my safety
it wasn&#39;t concerned about the power I
would love to bring the robot here so
you can hear the sound of the motors
struggling under the inertia of the
robot it&#39;s amazing what we can do with
math actually the math can sing a song
just as singers this is not a toy
this is lots of steel moving very fast
the math behind it shall be perfect so
you can get such smooth motions so my
research theme is collision avoidance
for collaborative robots it has to
subtitles collaborative robots and it
means robots that me that works with
proximity from the humans that have to
interact with the humans physically and
also collision avoidance what is mean it
means we need to make robots ever to the
humans so when the robot is moving it
doesn&#39;t hit the human
so what I am trying to do as I said the
suit of the future it&#39;s a suit with
sensors so the robot can receives my
presence at the same time I am working
on the control loop on the robot so I
want to in do the robots with advanced
motor skills human-like capabilities so
they can avoid collision with us this is
the demonstrator you have seen before so
the idea is with the demonstrator I want
to stress about something the robot is
not reprogrammed to do the reflexes
there is a smart algorithm that
generates the motion online so I do not
know how the robot is gonna react I know
that the robot is one gonna hit me so
the road has some sort of intelligence
and also it&#39;s not only one person could
be near the robot it could be several
persons several obstacles rushing the
robot from any direction with any
velocity the robot shall react safely
where are we going to use this algorithm
collision avoidance I&#39;m going to show a
case study in automobile industry it&#39;s
the fabrication of car door the car door
has slots in that in those slots we need
to insert parts
as in the following sequence you have
the part the slot and the part inside
the slot so for this I use the
collaborative robotic sell this
declarative robotic cell and there is a
human me working beside the robot the
idea is I have to do some work the rock
shall receives my residence and then it
shall avoid collision with me giving a
space to work
I am wearing sensors you see the robot
is not very program
figure this out by itself it generates
the motion by itself you see right now
at the end of duel there is this part
right now there is coupling the rope
goes away I come here the robot the
robot receives my presence was away I go
back you can hear the sound of the
motors right now and even the table
stressed under the forces so here I am
right now working on robotics I&#39;m gonna
take you back where it started I was a
bachelor degree student in Syria and one
of my friends came to me he asked me to
do a laser CNC machine for him a lesson
CNC machine is a machine that cuts and
engrave wood and other materials using
lasers so you draw the shape on the
computer let me see the machine shall
cut it so the problem is I couldn&#39;t find
the parts what I shall do I couldn&#39;t
find the controllers to control the
machine so not only I had to construct
the mechanical system I also had to
construct the control system I know the
equations of motions very well and I
know how to program and the idea was to
figure out a way to put the equations of
motion inside the computer and use a
computer to control the machine well I
said the art computer is not required
adult computer will do the job here is
trial what I was of sibling the machine
I chose it because you can see the
brilliant purple colors coming out of
the laser tube whilst it fires it really
gives you such intense feelings
so after eight months of hard work going
to the University in the morning and
then working on the machine in the
evening I got the machine on and running
and when I hear the jingle the jingle of
the seal and the roar of the motors I
knew I knew what I wanted to do I want
to work in robotics here the machine is
engraving my name in Arabic letters on
Abby&#39;s foot
finally I want to share with you a story
about a road I had to take to come here
to Portugal so when I was in Syria the
water was already raging going to the
army service was mandatory my only way
out was to go to Algeria there I
couldn&#39;t get a residence card I couldn&#39;t
continue my studies I had to sleep in an
office and I had to work in construction
so I started to apply for scholarships
always being rejected my friends started
to tell me stop wasting time and money I
never listened
finally I got scholarship by braces and
Sampaio - here - were to go so the first
time I went to the airport the security
foreign services
return me back they didn&#39;t allow it to
go out failure so I spoke with doctora
Helena the adviser of presidents and bio
she said that she&#39;s gonna bring me in
again here - were to go so for the
second time I go to the airport the
security services thought that my visa
was fake
so just because I&#39;m from Syria so while
everybody was waiting in the line I had
to stay outside of the line surrounded
by security services people were looking
at me as if I was criminal oh my god it
was really very embarrassing
lately I wasn&#39;t able to attend the
conference in Italy because also
passport issues but the thing is I never
regret I never stopped I do what they
believe in and Here I am doing what I
love
thank you
you
