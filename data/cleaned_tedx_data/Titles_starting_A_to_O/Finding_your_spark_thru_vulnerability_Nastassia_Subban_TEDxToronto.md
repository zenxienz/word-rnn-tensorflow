on October 24th 2016 so basically a year
ago today I found myself outside my
classroom crushed defeated unafraid
literally five minutes before my class
was to start I hear one of the worst
things to hear as a teacher as a person
one of my students at the young age of
23 had his life taken over the weekend
and now I have to figure out what I&#39;m
gonna say to my class but I&#39;m fearful I
don&#39;t want to say too much in front of
them everyone knows teachers are just
supposed to state facts not their
feelings and I don&#39;t want to cry in
front of them because everybody knows
teachers should never cry in front of
their students so I&#39;m literally standing
outside my classroom talking to myself
trying to figure out how I&#39;m gonna keep
my emotions intact stay in control and
say I&#39;m not gonna be holding class today
because one of my students was killed
not just any student a student who had a
magnetic smile a student who was loving
and kind a student who had the spark
that student with the sickness in my
stomach I walk into my classroom put my
bag down take a breath
open my mouth and the tears just flooded
literally all the feelings I have been
feeling over my past eleven years of
teaching were surfacing I was saddened
by society life and every single thing
in between because this was not supposed
to happen
Deshawn had his whole life ahead of him
he had goals dreams desires and like I
said he had that spark on that day I was
unexpectedly open with my class there
were no lesson plans
no rubrics no script no rehearsal just
me raw and vulnerable in the education
world we call this a teachable moment my
class was silent I actually think they
were shocked think back to the time when
you realize that for the first time your
teacher was a human being the first time
you saw them at the mall or the grocery
store you&#39;re walking through the aisles
you pick up a couple apples you look to
your left cuz you hear familiar boys say
hello and all you could do is look up
and say mr. Adams you eat apples that
was the vibe in the room weird and
awkward they didn&#39;t know what to do I
didn&#39;t know what to do so I just started
sharing my memories about DeSean and
within moments there was an unspoken
connection an unspoken understanding
that even though I&#39;m their teacher I&#39;m a
person first and life happens to me too
that day I began to reimagine
vulnerability as a strength so there are
two things I want to tell you about
vulnerability the first one is that
vulnerability strengthens our
relationships with others what I thought
would have positioned me as weak in the
classroom actually strengthened my
relationship with my students DeShawn&#39;s
passing reminded me that in order to be
a good teacher we need to be willing to
build those relationships I&#39;ve forgotten
about that
I forgot that I not only thought DeSean
and his classmates in the classroom but
I saw them at the community center where
I could smell the peppers and sauces
from their cooking classes I could see
the intensity and concentration on their
faces during pick-up basketball and I
could hear the joy and pleasure
as they learn Caribbean dance and they
laughed and they pointed and they
laughed at me as I tried to follow the
moves they were a part of my life
and I was a part of their they met my
family and friends
they saw me and in return I was able to
see them I showed them my spark
somewhere along my journey as an
educator I have forgotten about that
I forgot that no matter where you teach
whether it&#39;s an area deemed at risk or
an affluent one whether you&#39;re teaching
small children teenagers or adults
relationships must be fostered in order
for classrooms to thrive and that
requires vulnerability at this point in
the game it is non-negotiable so that
day that day the wall that I had created
between teacher and student between
coldness and connectedness crumbled
gradually what happened was that the
students in my class their wall started
to crumble too they started to ask
critical questions they began engaging
in meaningful intentional dialogue they
were less hesitant and less afraid to
discuss matters around race racism class
and gender they shared their stories of
love hurt resilience and fear and I
shared mine base on me and in return I
was able to see them and but most
importantly they were able to start to
see the spark in themselves and the
classroom felt transformed when was the
last time you had a meaningful
relationship with someone when was the
last time you were able to share your
truth is your wall blocking your spark
from shining it&#39;s your wall blocking you
from building meaningful relationships
that wall needs to crumble in order to
strengthen your relationships with
others and yourself and that is the last
thing I want to tell you about
vulnerability vulnerability strengthens
your relationship with yourself as I
started
watch my students grow and develop I
started to question my own growth and
development I started asking myself a
million questions some of them that were
extremely difficult and some that just
kept coming back to me looking for an
answer what was my intention
as an educator why did I want to hide
those tears that day did I in some way
fail desean and who am i to be teaching
other people&#39;s children I had to begin
to answer some of those questions here I
had to give myself permission to change
I had to surrender I had to realize that
though on the outside the wall looks
sturdy I had to embrace the fact that I
hurt I really hurt deshaun was someone
who represented to me light hope and
resilience and his death shattered my
soul and crushed my hope my insecurities
my complex family dynamics and my
regrets were also things I was holding
on to that weren&#39;t allowing to me
allowing me to become the educator and
person I could be I had to begin to work
through some of those things in order to
become the educator and person that I am
today
so today I am a course director out of
Teachers College I&#39;m inviting teacher
candidates to explore vulnerability in
the in the classroom I am encouraging a
movement one class at a time I&#39;m
inviting them to explore their journey
as an educator and as a person while I
continue to explore my own I&#39;m asking
them to share their life experiences and
consider some of the questions I had
said before leaders in educational
theory like Parker J Palmer bell hooks
and a Rudolf Steiner say that the only
way to teach
to be deeply immersed in self-knowledge
if one does not know themselves one
cannot teach well it is that simple when
our walls are up
there&#39;s no vulnerability there is no
spark where there is no spark there&#39;s no
light where there is no light there can
be no learning when teacher and student
are not taking risks together there can
be no love nor trust but we all know
this we know the teachers we loved and
the ones we couldn&#39;t stand and why we
have seen the numerous TED talks on
vulnerability we have been to a
conference listened to a podcast read a
book had coffee with somebody and talked
about it and what happens after we give
gratitude for five days we meditate for
a few mornings and then we go back to
our regular routine how do I know I&#39;ve
done it like a hundred a thousand times
what will happen after this talk you
know who am i but a teacher from Toronto
the six I&#39;m smiling because I can see
one of my students in the back right
there and he&#39;s saying this Subban do not
ever do that again
shoutout to SPL so I mean what do I know
I just had a moment so I dug up some
research from this school I&#39;m not sure
if anyone has heard of it Harvard great
okay in 2015 they did a study in a grade
9 class and what they found was when
teacher and students build a meaningful
relationship and share some type of
common ground they both like soccer or
the movies etc those students did better
academically this stuff works Harvard
said so I have three sons legacy who&#39;s
six epic who&#39;s four and a half and honor
who&#39;s four and a half yes epic and honor
are twins and before you do the math
legacy in the twins are 21 months apart
do I recommend that for anybody
No
and I&#39;m looking around the room and I
could see the look of exhaustion on your
faces just thinking about the type of
energy it takes to get through a 24 hour
period with them and it&#39;s exactly what
you&#39;re thinking but it&#39;s a whole other
talk thankfully they&#39;ve started school I
want when they have finished high school
to be able to tell me about all the
wonderful teachers they had the ones
that they knew believed they were worthy
of love and belonging because they could
feel it the ones they knew where they
saw teachers taking risks alongside them
and they knew because they could see it
I&#39;m the ones they knew celebrated their
triumphs and challenged them to do more
because they could hear it these are the
teachers that would have understood the
strength of vulnerability these are the
teachers that would have encouraged my
sons
to show their spark and these are the
teachers I want not only for my children
but for all children with all the buzz
around vulnerability there is no time
better than right now to do this work
with integrity and intention embrace the
fear that is holding you back
own it accept that it will always be
there and then let it go you cannot
build walls forever I hope you joined
the movement email me don&#39;t call me
because I never answer my phone I have a
running soundtrack of screaming boys in
the background give yourself permission
to be vulnerable give yourself
permission to show your spark the time
is now
magach MLC thank you
you
