I want to show you a video scandals
happen all the time the question is how
the democracy is finally those animals
and what will it mean for for the wider
region I think one of your children is
just walked in i mean shift is shifting
shifting sands in the region to the
relations with the north may change I
would be surprised to be you know North
Korea North and South Korea&#39;s policy
choices on North Korea have been
severely limited in the last six months
perhaps some of you seen this video on
social media from 2017 it exposes a
domestic reality of life as working
parents but there was a darker side to
the reaction on social media
commentators assumed that Jung a Kim the
Asian woman who ran into after the kids
out was the nanny and not his wife
perhaps some of you has seen that too so
those who thought that Jung a Kim was a
nanny it&#39;s worth thinking about why you
thought that I&#39;m nya me I was born in
England married an Australian and moved
to a regional town just outside of
Melbourne and we have three young
children until 806 so I&#39;m also familiar
with Randy and the children on to the
floor but I&#39;m also familiar with that
question are you their nanny I was in a
shop in City with my son it was a small
gift shop in an affluent area and I was
asked the same question
are you the nanny no why replies she
then asked is he yours at that moment I
realised I wasn&#39;t in London the perhaps
exposure multiracial relationships mixed
race or biracial children wasn&#39;t a norm
to a lot of people my first reaction was
to be very defensive because I was being
questioned
and whether or not there was a mother to
my son based on my skin tone I grew up
in London one of the most ethnicity in
the world and I was surrounded by
different cultures even in my own family
this is normal but when moving to
Australia I realised there was a new
normal and I appeared to be a minority
especially in the affluent areas where I
was constantly being asked where are you
from and I reply London then they&#39;ll say
no where are you really from and I reply
back I was born and raised in London but
then I understood many people in
Australia if they think that your skin
colour defined your ethnicity and that
British equals white and any variation
on that is questioned a person&#39;s
ethnicity say isn&#39;t where we were born
my journey into the workplace took me
into child care well my eyes were opened
up even more I asked questions like
because you&#39;re black do you see me as
back when you look at me or are you are
Aboriginal of the TV and can you wash
your skin so it&#39;s not dirty I made a
decision to start taking some sort of
action so I started sending emails to
childcare centers so we could increase
resources that were more inclusive we
started putting educational books
directing different families in
different race we started putting dolls
of color in which I had to source from
overseas it was real easy to find the
white princess doll from the film frozen
but try and find another doll like Moana
and it was almost impossible so our
parents drive in the market demand and
if so why aren&#39;t they buying those like
milliner or at least both and why did i
need to purchase dolls and resources
overseas in order to represent an
Australian family like mine according to
Australian census from 2016 thirty five
percent of Australians were born
overseas and in most states the average
household had at least one parent that
was born overseas and the typical
migrant moving to Victoria isn&#39;t from
New Zealand or from England they&#39;re from
India we live in a very colorful country
and always
has but the truth isn&#39;t being exposed
the media paint a picture of race
khuddam and my children&#39;s heroes in
their books and in a media of Caucasian
families of all the TV shows that were
produced from 2011 to 2015 a massive
eighty-two percent of the characters
were Caucasian is that the Australian
that you guys think this is Toit
Australia&#39;s latest contribution to the
story

play is crucial to every child&#39;s
development and important notice from
the Australian toy Association there are
so many different people within
Australia from so many different
cultures and so many different ethnic
groups if you want to see it a real
representation of the Australian
population then hop aboard a tram look
at the carriages on the people on board
you will see the real Australia the
multicultural diverse mix of the
Australian population but when you look
at our television programs you will see
a vastly different cast to the one on
the tram why is that the media industry
is predominantly Caucasian and the pupil
being hired or pretty much all complete
Caucasian so how will things change if
the industry doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t it&#39;s time
that we start thinking about hiring new
generations of diverse cultures for
directors and actors I know things have
changed and we are taking strides but
it&#39;s just not enough and if I couldn&#39;t
find what I was looking for then it was
my responsibility to rewrite the story
my beautiful children shouldn&#39;t have
their hair touched should be wondering
why people look at them strangely and
shouldn&#39;t be wondering why people are
asking where they&#39;re from when they were
born Australian so I started to write a
book was about my family&#39;s experience of
diversity and acceptance in a kid for
anyway so I started sending it off the
Australian publishing companies and
waited for their response so instead I
decided not to give up and I started to
fund the book myself and I got it
self-published over the USA and I
started sending it to educational boards
childcare centers any place I could
think of I said to out and then the
response was positive and I started to
get interests people calling me up to go
on to shows and talk about the message
of the book and to come into schools so
when it&#39;s a few schools and I started
talking about the book and the main
message and the kids were very receptive
and the book was about my family and how
we may look a little different from each
other how our skin colors were different
or we might have features that look
different but in all our families were
all a little bit different and the main
thing is that we love each other
we&#39;ll all you
nique and we&#39;re all special in our own
way and the kids were so respectful
there are so many questions they talked
about the book and they&#39;re really
interested in the story but the impact
didn&#39;t just stop at the children and the
comment was from a mother with her
blended family she said how her daughter
after reading the book was now embracing
who she was and she could see the way
her daughter&#39;s thinking and
understanding had changed
another comment was from a mother who
said she felt ashamed this is the first
book she had read to her children
featuring a multiracial family on the
front cover books and resources at
featuring ethnic or multiracial people
are only for us you know the United
States have quotas for racial diversity
and they&#39;ve resulted in a record number
of shows featuring access from all
diverse backgrounds networks in the
United Kingdom are also considering
introducing them as responsible
all-white cast that that&#39;s happening at
the moment I think this is something
that Australia should also be looking at
because we are still failing to reflect
our multi racial diversity I want to
show you something because children see
want what they see on TV and there are
very few options for us out there the
ethnic children might mix race children
minority children we don&#39;t get a say in
the media there&#39;s hardly any image
images that are promoting us in a
positive way and I want ask to feel just
as beautiful as the children that we see
on TV I want people to see that we are
just as important as the children and we
sit on the TV and we need to fill that
other children see us and they know that
we are important and it&#39;s all about
inclusion when if you seen an advert
featuring a black child or white child
holding a black doll or Barbie Hammond
if you seen that you don&#39;t see that on
the TV it will see the white doll of the
blonde hair and the blue eyes and when
my child looks at the TV he sees these
things and he never relates to them he
can&#39;t write my daughter she wants the
long hair and the blond hair she doesn&#39;t
see the children with a curly afro hair
or the brown skin on the TV so what she
sees is what she wants we need to be
more inclusive I want to show you this
photo that was taken by Chris buck it
was featured in The Oprah Magazine
it
makes its readers consider stereotypes
and this photo reflects what it was like
for me and many others growing up and
why I don&#39;t want it to be for your
children or mine
I hope this photo helps you understand
how important recitation is if we can
educate ourselves and our children from
a young age instead of asking are you
the nanny or where are you from they
will ask how is your day and simply come
and ask my children to play
multiculturalism is our culture with
increasing numbers of blended families
and within different cultures it&#39;s
important that we recognize this and
with embrace it
and reflect it in our media to normalize
this society isn&#39;t it time that we
educate inform and inspire it&#39;s let&#39;s be
part of the change mix it up Australia
