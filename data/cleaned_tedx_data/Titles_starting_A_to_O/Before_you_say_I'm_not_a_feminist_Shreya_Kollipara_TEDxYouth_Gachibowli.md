hi everyone
so before we start I&#39;d like to introduce
this brainchild of mine I was gonna call
it the person who doesn&#39;t get it but I
think we&#39;ll just give him a name and
call him Bob so Bob is a physical
embodiment of society I&#39;m sorry so he&#39;s
basically um an insane person who
doesn&#39;t really understand anything and
he&#39;ll appear here and there everywhere
throughout the speech so yeah it&#39;s a
quick disclaimer so if if you believe
that men and women should receive equal
rights and be treated equally and if
someone asks you if you&#39;re a feminist
you should be saying yes because it may
sound crazy but that&#39;s how words work
now if you like to eat meat for example
and someone asks you if you&#39;re
non-vegetarian if you can&#39;t just say oh
no no that&#39;s too aggressive of a word
hi I&#39;m Shia and I&#39;m a feminist
now if you just envisioned me speedily
running across the road with a sign that
says kill all men hi again and I&#39;m here
to help fix your vision because I can&#39;t
run that fast but well that&#39;s not what
feminism is really about this angry
screaming woman character that we have
that oddly shares the same tone of
speech as a dot Hitler and also the same
mustache is not a feminist and what she
endorses isn&#39;t really feminism feminism
is the radical notion this out of the
world concept and the crazy idea that
woman and men should be treated equally
that they should receive equal rights
and opportunities have equal social
statuses be paid equally and not be
constricted by gender norms which is
nothing but a byproduct of patriarchy
but recently our mash nation has gone
wild and feminism has become everything
cept this it is looked at as a system
that hates on men it is looked at as a
system that hates on woman that idea
traditionally feminine stereotypes it is
looked at as a system or a method to
propel woman onto the throne of the
world and award them privilege in the
name of a movement it&#39;s looked at as
everything except an ideology that
advocates for equality on the basis of
one sex and unfortunately these
misinterpretations about feminism have
come to become its definitions so the
first and ironically the most popular
misinterpretation about feminism is that
it doesn&#39;t stand for equality and I got
it it&#39;s difficult to understand but Bob
asks why is called feminism if it stands
for equality well Bob it&#39;s called
feminism on the basis of a system called
equity which is where everyone receives
what they deserve or need as opposed to
equality where everyone receives the
same thing now you could think of it
like this you have your left arm and
your right arm and your left arms
naturally weaker because you&#39;ve never
exercised it as much as you right arm
you&#39;ve always exercised your right arm
making those really weird grunting
noises why do people do that but now you
realize for you to function as
efficiently as possible we need both
your arms to be equally strong so would
you exercise both of them for the same
amount of time or with the same weights
both smaller not exactly because that
wouldn&#39;t that would definitely make both
of them stronger but never equal in
strength so ideally what you do is
exercise your laughter I&#39;m a bit more
and that would I make it equal in
strength and that&#39;s gender equality for
you woman being systemically oppressed
means they&#39;ve ended up in society weaker
positions so we are the left arm because
the world hasn&#39;t fed them well with the
rights and opportunities they&#39;re
entitled to as humans so now for a woman
to become equal to men you&#39;d have to
give them what they deserve and need
which is equity so you&#39;d have to give
them all the freedom and the love and
the good stuff that makes your biceps
pop and
and now you&#39;d have to that&#39;s what so
that&#39;s what feminism works towards right
it starts with equity and it comes out
with equality
it gives rights and things to people
that don&#39;t have them and since women are
in the process of receiving a lot of
these the rights opportunities education
health care not well to some extent
maybe being born because female feticide
is still a thing with that&#39;s why it&#39;s
called feminism and you can&#39;t just say
it&#39;s not equality because women are
protesting abortion rights because I
quality would be giving men abortion
rights and just a thought like maybe
they don&#39;t really need them so but the
one abortion that maybe men and women
both need is one that gets rid of the
gender biases or gender roles that we
conform to and expect others to conform
to when feminists asked for a society
that isn&#39;t prejudiced against women that
don&#39;t undertake traditional female roles
we also asked her society that doesn&#39;t
put the pressure on men to be exposed to
at all where they have to be distressed
out here away breadwinner of the
household when we asked for society that
that gets rid of their stereotypically
weak and submissive female characters we
also asked them to get rid of their
historically consequent contr parts the
stoic and dominant male character
because here&#39;s the deal right tourism
and equality is not just about allowing
woman equal pay it&#39;s about allowing men
to be taken seriously about issues that
supposedly don&#39;t affect real men sexual
abuse and eating disorders are just a
few of these things now so that&#39;s what
feminism works towards it works towards
helping men express emotion they&#39;ve been
historically shamed for expressing
because again having feelings are
feminine like if Society was a person
which is Bob they&#39;d say ridiculous
things like this if you cry boy you
would become a birth giving human it&#39;s
natural obviously and the now the second
thing that usually drives people away
from feminism
is the phenomenal gender wage gap so
it&#39;s been called fake and statistically
flawed because previously it did compare
the income of women in generally lesser
paid jobs to men in higher paid jobs and
what are there are studies that are
fatally flawed as such because they were
made by crazy people there are
statistics that show how much lesser
women are being paid even while working
the same jobs so just a quick question
what was the one movie this year that
made the film industry of India more
popular than anything the one film that
went more than thousand roars yes it&#39;s
bubbly but did you know that bubbly paid
its actors around five times more than
they paid their female actresses and
it&#39;s a little bit odd like I get it the
actor like flew from a palm tree and he
climbed an elephant and he shot like
four arrows at a time I&#39;m pretty sure
the female actress also shot for hours
at a time but I didn&#39;t I only watch
movie wants so it doesn&#39;t make that much
sense like are you gonna pay him 20
crores more just because he flew from a
palm tree or because he&#39;s a man it&#39;s
something to think about because it
makes you look at the movie in a new
light the entire film industry in a
movie you like and the last most
confusing thing about feminism is the
fact it&#39;s actually a kind of like plague
within it and I think that&#39;s called a
feminazi but the politically correct
term would be an imbecile so it&#39;s a
little confusing feminism can be
misinterpreted
even by the people it stands up for I
had issues understanding feminism
because I thought it was supposed to
hate on men and then it&#39;d been paid on
men but I thought I was supposed to hate
and like run away from all boys because
they had the cheese touch or something
so it&#39;s it&#39;s a little complicated a few
days back or a few weeks back I messaged
one&#39;s friends and asked them if they
were all feminists and when I received
responses like this I&#39;ll give you some
time to read it
I understood that people age it
immediately thought that feminism was
something that could have multiple
contradictory definitions that were all
propagated by feminists that feminism
could mean both fighting for equality in
fighting against men that feminists for
people that both spoke up for access to
spoke up for equal access to education
and screamed for free birth control and
that&#39;s not what feminism is and that&#39;s
not who a feminist is a feminist my
record isn&#39;t anyone who fights the
opposite sex in the name of equality it
isn&#39;t anyone who shames a woman for
making the choice look over a household
and not becoming an affluent
businesswoman it isn&#39;t anyone who&#39;s
shaming and humiliating girls for liking
makeup in dolls because for God&#39;s sake
the point is to become equal not to
become a man it isn&#39;t anyone who&#39;s
humiliating and saying people are less
of a feminist before making choices and
doing things that may seem traditionally
masculine or feminine a feminist isn&#39;t
anyone who says discrimination against
one sorry discrimination against women
is strong for that discrimination
against men is equality that&#39;s not what
feminism is about that&#39;s someone who&#39;s
becoming Bob
so it&#39;s feminists or people we are
people that advocate for equality we are
women and men that are proud to be women
and men we are humans that just want to
be thought of as humans and not objects
or followers of Hitler so at the end of
the day if you&#39;re a feminist that won&#39;t
make you a bloodthirsty mess andrius it
doesn&#39;t make you a sexist it makes you
human so the next time someone asks you
if you&#39;re a feminist maybe try about and
think about what it really stands for
before you lash out in the accent the
next time someone asks you if you&#39;re a
feminist maybe we try and say yes
because I promised Hitler one kill you
and you&#39;ll be a better person than Bob
is thank you
[Applause]
