some people say each one of us was born
with a gift that you&#39;re born with
certain talents where we naturally excel
and some things and do okay it is almost
as if you&#39;re just born with a contract
that steers us towards what we are good
at the arms and heads dictates what we
should be doing in coalition&#39;s but is
that really always the case should be
let such a contractor that definitive
they&#39;re thinking that way have the
potential of some there are choices
sometimes I&#39;m consciously think of
activity you look something you&#39;re
absolutely passionate about maybe it&#39;s
for an instrument or even a class now
think of an activity you don&#39;t enjoy
something making the thought of weeks
ago now I want you to compare the two
and notice how much your efforts
probably contrast with each other it&#39;s a
lot isn&#39;t it well it is obvious that you
tend to put more effort into the foods
you love you don&#39;t things we love we&#39;re
passionate about we work hard to be the
best better
where are the things we don&#39;t
particularly care for we do have minimal
passionate I&#39;ve heard or just drop you
indulge with them at all
your perception affects reaction to
situations from interactions with my
peers I realized that we have allowed
ourselves to grow up having opinions
about the foods we are faced with
whether we enjoy taking part
we encountered but if they really come
to think about it how does that serve us
in any beneficial way all that does
absent-mindedly determine how much
better to what we do growing up
I made the same mistake everybody else
did I told myself was looking at several
things on Facebook but come on everybody
does it and a lot of people will
disagree with me it&#39;s evening you don&#39;t
need to be all that but we have it so
profoundly engraved into our brain to
dislike certain things we don&#39;t realize
that one of the main things what we
continued or not started in different
fields or using we enjoy the busier face
with it&#39;s because we refuse to see our
potential of succeeding in that death
but we can change all that and we can
start with the cosplay initiative which
probably only sounds familiar to
psychologists but it&#39;s basically a
method of controlling your influence I
think it is also a dramatic tower it
would respond in a control game by the
president of states stimulus is
something that encourages activity to
begin info and in eighteen nineties even
half of papers new theory about behavior
he conducted one of the most prominent
psychological experiments called
Pavlov&#39;s dog experiment he discovered
that through a gradual training process
emotions can be learned how will observe
that his thoughts would salivate at the
presence of food so he decided that
every time he would bring about every
time he&#39;d feed his dog he would drink
about the dog was obviously didn&#39;t
salivating here in the developing at
first but after numerous times during
this procedure the dogs associated the
sound of the Bell with food so they
learned that whenever the bell rang they
would be fed by the end of the procedure
the dogs have learned the dogs would
salivate at the present the sound of a
bell even before they even saw our small
children in classical conditioning the
unconditioned stimulus Anu
paired to eventually evoke a conditioned
response the unconditioned stimulus is
something that naturally triggers a
response like the food in Salman&#39;s
experiment how it made the dog salivate
where&#39;s the neutral stimulus is
something that does not going to be
provoked natural response like in
Pablo&#39;s experiment it was not a natural
response of the dogs to salivate at the
sound of the Bell as a result of the
apparent however keep the neutral
stimulus becomes a conditioned response
so when I petted Palance experiment the
dolphin learned to salivate this sounded
up how those experiment shows us how
we&#39;re able to alter our behavior tipping
differently about something and how and
in the same way that he was able to
create motivation within the dogs learn
to salivate at the sound of a bell we
will create the motivation for ourselves
to but don&#39;t worry I can assure you all
this for exhaustion students so clearly
the motivation has a huge partner
learning to love something you must in
and there are two main types of
motivation intrinsic and extrinsic by
definition intrinsic motivation is
performing an option or behavior and
seeing it as an opportunity to learn
explore or actualize potentials where
our extrinsic motivation is doing the
sort of task we were to obtain the
reward up to bettering respect someone
who plays a sport solely for the purpose
of enjoyment or I need to improve has
intrinsic motivation Russell who plays a
sport to compete newer to win trophies
or medals has experts in motivation
however when it comes down to the to
intrinsic motivation is more powerful
because the drive comes from within so
the effects tend to last longer since
they aren&#39;t basic objectives that can&#39;t
be guaranteed but getting money or
facing the results possible conditioning
and motivation work together and burn to
allow us to learn to love something we
must in it and I&#39;m saying this because I
tried it myself when I was a little girl
my mom set me up with
domestics and the only hand can really
say but is that I was not very good at
it after doing it for a couple of years
absolutely no liking towards it as
anticipated by stomping through but my
mom said it that I still had to continue
gymnastics hopes that I would someday
change my mind and the truth is I did my
intrinsically motivated was that I hated
to see myself failing that is how I
conditioned myself into becoming a
better gymnast I worked harder to push
myself further practice for many many
additional hours and as a result I went
from this to this advanced proficiency
award about to both medicines a couple
months later and even more importantly I
genuinely became really passionate about
my sport but here&#39;s the catch you will
have to work for this it really isn&#39;t
that easy to just get there and you will
all face hard times in various fields we
try but it is at this point in your
journey where you will need to rely on
your motivators most if you have big
motivators this is the stage where
you&#39;re most likely give up I mean in my
process of learning to love the 15
athletes I have to push through so many
moments of death records have seen it I
was able to do that because I have
strong motivators but ok so this has
happened to me that&#39;s only one person
not very convincing right but what else
by curiosity of hard to tell me that
this has also happened to someone else
someone has already made it let&#39;s talk
Michael Phelps the most decorated
Olympian of all time when he first
started swimming at the age of 70 it
something will get here too can get his
head into the water due to his fear but
Phelps didn&#39;t give up at that after what
to 1996
smells like Tom Dolan and Tom OpCo
motivated him to get into the water get
over a sphere and just start swimming so
this is not the age of seven only eight
years later by the time Phelps is 15 he
were to break his first world record at
the 2004 Olympics that&#39;s crazy isn&#39;t it
well how far is he gonna be hard to tell
you that you are able to do the same
thing and how achievable by having a
growth mindset for many years professor
of psychology at Stanford University
Carol Dweck observed the way people
dealt with failure and suggests that any
individual it&#39;s a tendency to believe
that their talents can be mastered
various beings have a mindset
however this mindset isn&#39;t hard to
obtain numerous advances in neuroscience
actions that the human brain is way more
malleable do you think so you may be
wondering that well what is it easy
waiting for useful and you can start by
viewing challenges as opportunities or
replace the word Galen for the word
learning fundamentally don&#39;t doubt
yourself there&#39;s no doubt chances just
because you think you may not succeed so
although I&#39;m not throwing these new
concepts and ideas to you I guess an
immunity to be candidly applied to
yourself
so if there&#39;s something you&#39;re not to
make safe work will eventually face that
you don&#39;t hav pardon I have three simple
steps cream first identify what it is
that you need to improve and recognize
you have a choice in what you do and
decide to love secondly find extrinsic
there preferably intrinsic motivation
here&#39;s a third week and lastly a lot of
yourself to understand that challenges
will come along the way and that you all
have to work for this but trust me it
would be so worth it especially since
from there on it&#39;s a matter of time
editor media artists it&#39;s through as
doing so and I&#39;ll provide the right
circumstance precondition yourself and
oh I guess it would be unreasonable for
me to go around asking everybody but
maybe a time on the table stuff
however if there&#39;s whatever it is that
you generally don&#39;t enjoy taking part in
someone else out there is passionate
about that one thing and spends the
summer days driving people to be the
best at it because of how much they love
it so if they were able to find the
positives for whatever it is that they
love but you hate and they are able to
see it from Earth a beautiful
perspective don&#39;t you think you can&#39;t do
earlier I mentioned how a contract can
be so definitive in our lives and how
easily can affect or actually determine
the things we are meant to be doing many
of us including myself really treated
this contract as if it has to be
absolute in our lives but really it is
our viewpoint of this contract that
needs to be modified Maya Thomas to you
today is to destroy that contract and
begin the process of reading arrow
you
