so I&#39;m standing in my living room
holding a list of every online purchase
I&#39;d made in the four years prior
yikes in that time I&#39;d spent twelve
thousand dollars on over three hundred
and fifty things let&#39;s just say I got to
know the neighborhood UPS person very
well on that list I saw a lot of things
I didn&#39;t even remember buying but what
was not on that list were the family
trips that I didn&#39;t go on and the
wedding of a friend of mine that I
didn&#39;t feel like I get could attend it
because I couldn&#39;t afford it I couldn&#39;t
help but feel as though my priorities
had been hijacked that one click
purchase felt like more of just a muscle
movement that an intentional choice and
that is what I call the twitch the
twitch is an unintentional unproductive
response to discomfort and that
discomfort shows up in many different
ways it might be boredom it might be
desire but the twitch is a quick
solution to those feelings even though
it doesn&#39;t solve anything
and I promise if you have experienced
the twitch yourself you are not alone
it&#39;s because every aspect of our modern
digital lives is designed to be
incredibly addicting companies use the
same strategies that casinos use to keep
you playing the slots to keep you coming
back and it doesn&#39;t help that all of the
wrong things are getting easier let&#39;s
take this for example two activities
going out and buying a pair of running
shoes and going to the gym to workout
both of those things at one point took
very similar amounts of effort you would
put on your clothes you&#39;d step out you&#39;d
maybe get into the car and then you&#39;d
either shop or you&#39;d go work out
I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t have to tell you
which one of those two activities has
become incredibly easy unfortunately not
the working out so why does this matter
why does it matter to break the twitch
because if we don&#39;t we are letting
someone else decide what is most
important to us the twitch hijacks our
ability to be there for the people we
love and work towards long-term goals
it&#39;s because the small things truly add
up but there is a way out there are two
things that I&#39;ve done in my own life to
break the twitch and live more
intentionally the first thing you can do
is notice simply notice when you get the
urge to twitch if you&#39;re taking out your
phone and checking social media buying
something online and do not feel shame
because realize that this is a system
that is created to keep you coming back
the second thing you can do is work to
create intentional friction intentional
friction is best explained with a paper
towel let&#39;s pretend that you&#39;re using
too many paper towels and you want to
use fewer every time you wash your hands
you reach over if you just put a rubber
band over the paper towels every time
you reach you won&#39;t be able to grab one
it will take extra effort you&#39;re putting
intentional friction back in that
process if you have facebook on your
phone I&#39;d be willing to bet that you
could open the app without opening your
eyes in that instance you can move the
app to somewhere else so your brain has
to think a little bit more delete the
app completely so you can only use it on
a computer if it&#39;s online shopping you
can remove your credit card information
you can log out of your accounts so that
you give yourself a fighting chance and
making an intentional decision we have
to fiercely protect our idle moments
even when they&#39;re uncomfortable so that
when we look back we will see evidence
of a life well-lived and not a list
of things soon forgotten thank you
