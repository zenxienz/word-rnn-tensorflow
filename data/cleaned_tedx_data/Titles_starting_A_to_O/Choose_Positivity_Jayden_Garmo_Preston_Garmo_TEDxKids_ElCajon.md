could who believe a kid like me with
massive muscles gets bullied on occasion
in fact a new study shows that 75% of
kids are scared to go to school because
of bullying what is a bully a bully&#39;s
not defined purely as a person it is
their actions that make us boys you&#39;re
not there are different methods of
bullying
sometimes bullying can be physical
verbal or even through cyberspace
usually the instigators are the bullies
pick on other people because they lack
self-respect and probably by themselves
and many circumstances are bullying the
victors have to live in the most
vulnerable people such as the very young
that elderly and people with special
needs
throw scoops for society are not the
only victims that bullies go after
bullies can go after anyone we all
haven&#39;t targeted for bullying at some
point or another in our lives what does
a bully look like we rarely think of
ourselves we have a stereotypical image
of what a bully looks like we need to
realize that we are all capable in
having a bully like attitude even the
nicest people around us how probably
bully others on occasion I know it is
hard to believe that each of us have
engaged in wrongful conduct against
others but it&#39;s true none of us are
perfect everyone has a good side and I
believe that most of us have good
intentions but some of us have a hard
time drinking them out some people
choose to bring out their good side
while other is pouring out their evil
side we often rely on excuses and blame
others for our actions when we have no
one else to blame but ourselves the
decision to bully or even to make a
negative remark is completely within our
powers we make the choice as to what
comes out of our mouths and we choose
our actions it is completely up to us
and control
say or do you might ask why do people
bully you know when I think of the acts
of bullying I think of someone in that
very moment not being happy with their
life that moment of unhappiness causes
each of us to become bullies by our
actions and what comes out of our mouths
Jaden I call it the bullying all of us
it can come out at any time especially
when we look at situations negatively
even as a kid I see it every day at
school at home when we&#39;re shopping
and especially when we&#39;re driving it is
in that moment when we&#39;re looking in the
glass half-empty and the way saying do
mean things Jaden
what can we do to stop bullying if we
truly want to put an end to bullying
winter examine our own thoughts feelings
and actions we did it perceive each and
every moment we have on this earth in a
positive light many of us feel that were
often victims when in fact we&#39;re the
ones bullying ourselves when we pity
ourselves how many times we really put
ourselves down I hate my hair I&#39;m too
short I&#39;m too fat that could have
smarter than me by looking at the glass
half-full
we can strive to be more positive to
ourselves first and then be more
impeccable with their words towards
others and think before we act the
responsibility lies within our own reach
we should also have thicker skins and
not take anything personally or
seriously we often allow outside
influences to affect your
decision-making process sometimes we
allow people to get underneath our skin
and we take what they say personally if
this happens we can only blame ourselves
because we not only have the capacity to
control our actions but also our
feelings and moves if it takes two to
tango then if we don&#39;t allow allow the
remarks of the bully to affect us then
the bullying would have lost if a bully
threatens harm that&#39;s one thing but if
they&#39;re really spouting off their mouths
we can remedy the situation by turning
the tables on them and actually being a
nice
to the bullies that&#39;s great advice for
all of us to follow but I like to see
some changes that can implement
immediately in order to create safer
schools and communities two things must
happen first anti-bullying needs to be
taught daily but children are taught at
a young age should be more positive
towards others with a daily
reinforcement of positive behavior we
can hope that as students grow older
they can learn to become nicer people
secondly every school playground needs
to include what I call a friendship
corner where students who are in need of
a friend buddy at recess can go this is
a great way for people of different
backgrounds to get to know one another
schools and teachers could provide
incentives to lure students into the
friendship corners such as extra credit
future the principal and plaques if it
takes a village to raise a child then
it&#39;s gonna take all of us to stop
bullying and remember if you get bleed I
will alert an adult being a bystander
does not help the situation be an
upstander and defend the person who is
getting bullied and when you go home
today
think about how you treated your family
your kids and yourself most of all and
remember to think positive because
positive thinking stops bullying
