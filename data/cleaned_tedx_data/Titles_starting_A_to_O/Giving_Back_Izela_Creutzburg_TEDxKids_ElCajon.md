1100 can you believe that number well
that&#39;s is a number that I am trying to
decrease I know many of you might be
thinking 1100 what there are 1100
homeless veterans in San Diego alone and
that is why it is my mission to help
every single one of them I like because
of my dad
he is a veteran he&#39;s a Marine Corps he
is the proud owner and CEO of canes and
canines his business sells dog collars
leashes shirts toys and food that dogs
can eat and with every product that he
sells he uses that money that he gets
from his product to help one homeless
veteran each time one day in class my
teacher asked me if I wanted to give
back to all homeless people or just
homeless veterans I said I just want to
give back to homeless veterans because
they are the ones who risk their lives
for us and now they live on the streets
in my opinion they do not deserve that
they&#39;re human beings they&#39;re just like
us they&#39;re just less fortunate
according to WWE Daschle Coalition for
homeless parents calm most homeless
parents are male but nine percent are
women the majority of homeless veterans
are single but some are married or not
single there are many reasons to why our
local homeless veterans become homeless
one reason is affordable housing
affordable housing is homes apartments
and condos that veterans can&#39;t afford
another reason is is it is hard for some
veterans to get jobs that provide enough
livable income live full income means to
get paid for work but that money has to
go to the roof over your head the
clothes on your back and the food on the
table and guess what some veterans don&#39;t
even have access to health care
whatsoever
the last reason that I will give you is
substance abuse according to Web MD
people abuse substances such as drugs
alcohol and tobacco to help them forget
what they saw after witnessing a
life-threatening event such as combat by
sharing this mission I want people to
know it a veteran is I want people to
know I Verne&#39;s become homeless and
finally I want you to know that homeless
veterans are still out there when they
shouldn&#39;t be I mean like come on there
is something we can do about it there is
something that we can all do to help and
that is why I challenge you whenever you
see someone who&#39;s homeless not just a
veteran but anybody who&#39;s homeless shake
their hand and if you want to give them
a sandwich or do anything you can to
help
