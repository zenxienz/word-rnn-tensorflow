I want to introduce you to my
friend Roberto Roberto is one of those
kindest warm heart
Kida scientists you ever meet I had the
privilege of being a friend and a
colleague to him he grew up in Argentina
studied at University of Bern Isaiah
raised and spent a lot of his career in
the United States where we met by the
time I met him he had already had a long
list of accomplishments having helped
start a company having helped lead
scientific teams with multiple patents
and really contributing to cancer
diagnostics and therapeutics and I was
really really glad to be able to work
with him and you wouldn&#39;t hear any of
this from Roberto himself he was super
humble and never took credit and was the
last to say anything bad about anybody
else and the last to say anything good
about himself so I had a great privilege
of working with him as we fought
together to figure out how to detect
cancer early using a blood test this
picture here is when we were celebrating
in London we had a major breakthrough in
our collaborators and in England and so
we went and visited since is one of our
first times to the UK we decided to
partake in the afternoon tea and we took
this picture to celebrate about a year
before this picture was taken
Roberto felt ill a little bit and went
to the emergency room and then the
doctors you know saw something in his GI
tract but didn&#39;t know what to do they
decided to keep him in the hospitals is
to study and also observe they were able
to do some procedures and you know they
didn&#39;t really find anything significant
so he left after a few days but if a
month after we took this picture Roberto
again was not feeling well and he went
back to the emergency room and
unfortunately this day was much much
longer they found cancer in his body the
cancer that they didn&#39;t find the last
time and it was already advanced and
after a few weeks
Roberto passed away
we were working on very technology that
would have helped Roberto finding cancer
early so we can treat it and the sad
thing is that this story isn&#39;t unique
and isn&#39;t rare around the world over
nine million people die of cancer every
year that&#39;s three times the population
of Quito imagine every year three times
the population the keep of dying from
this horrible disease and then there&#39;s
you hear in the news that there seems to
be a new cancer cure almost every day
every day you sort of open the newspaper
or you surf on the internet there just
seems to be you know a lot of great news
about cancer so how do we sort of
reconcile the paradox of all these
amazing discoveries for more and more
cancer cases coming and even more the
w-h-o the World Health Organization
radiation estimates that by the year
2020 that number 9 million we increased
by another 70% this would often when we
hear the word cancer strikes fear and
anger and sadness and all of us but I
want to give you a quick overview of
what&#39;s been happening in the cancer
field and give you a sense of hope
what&#39;s happening in cancer what&#39;s
happening in the frontlines of cancer
and our is there a solution that
potentially to fight this horrible
disease so in fact we&#39;re living for
those who are knee-deep in cancer
research we don&#39;t understand that we&#39;re
actually in the middle of three of the
most exciting revolutions and cancer
research the first one is cancer
genomics the genome is the entire DNA
all the genetic material of an organism
changes of a DNA called mutations are
ultimately what drives cancers to grow
and proliferate about 10 years ago I was
part of the team at Johns Hopkins in
Maryland Baltimore Maryland in the u.s.
that we were one of the first teams to
decode comprehensively the mutations of
cancers we did it first in colorectal
and breast cancers then pancreatic
cancers and brain cancers today there
are over 90 projects looking at all
different cancers in 17 countries
working hard to sort of figure out just
genetic basis of cancers and we&#39;re
making a lot of progress tens of
thousands of cancers are now understood
to extra trick to intricate molecular
detail we know many of the causes of
cancer and we know how to so start
started we know how to start targeting
them we have the map
the second big revolution is precision
medicine also known as personalized
medicine so urgently when cancer was
being treated it was given sort of these
one-size-fits-all often derived from
very toxic chemicals we know as so the
chemotherapy you know some of them has
with the right from mustard gas and the
key is to kill the cancer without
killing the person but without with
these recent sort of developments in
understanding the genetics of cancer
scientists have been able to develop
drugs that target those mutations only
in the cancer and not in the normal
person and this is called precision
medicine so then every person after you
map up what&#39;s the genetic mutations in
that cancer you can give different
treatments to different people people
often say this is the right drug to the
right patient at the right time in the
last ten years there&#39;s scores of new
target and medicines now available for
oncologist to be able to custom tailor
drugs for cancer patients the third and
recently most exciting development is
amino therapy so instead of giving sort
of drugs what scientists have been able
to do is to leverage our own immune
system which already fights diseases and
fights cancers in our body and be able
to leverage it to be able to fight
disease for example the scientists have
been able to find an off switch of the
immune system and actually still though
develop drugs to turn it back on and
already this is already some of them
being clinically approved and being used
by people all over the world there&#39;s
even more high tech where people are
able to take immune cells from the body
sort of engineer it trained in the
different ways and to put it back into
the body to fight cancer some of this is
it sounds almost like science fiction
but it&#39;s happening right now and it&#39;s
shown a lot of promise
this area immunotherapy
is one of the most promising areas at
cancer therapy while I was a researcher
at the National Institute of Health in
the u.s. at the National Cancer
Institute I was able to work with some
of the leaders and pioneers of this
field and I&#39;ve been able to seen the
explosion of this area of research today
there&#39;s hundreds of trials now available
for patients to participate in to
understand and be able to develop these
immunotherapies so these are the three
of the most exciting areas and
revolution completely new ways of
addressing cancer but why is it that
still people are suffering from cancer
today let me illustrate with one patient
so this is a patient this is a patient
with us cancer called melanoma it&#39;s a
skin cancer it looks horrible the cancer
has grown everywhere in his body however
scientists were able to sequence the
genetic material of the cancer and find
that there&#39;s a specific mutation where
we have the drug too so they gave this
drug to this patient and this what
happens
it&#39;s amazing the tumor melts away it&#39;s
like wow this is amazing this is this is
this is the future the sad thing is this
is not the end of the story a few months
later this picture is taken cancer has
come back the cancer have learned how to
evade the drug so the question is why
and how can we fight this the answer is
this term called tumor heterogeneity let
me explain so in in the cancer cell
let&#39;s say as small as one centimeter in
size as well a small assist one
centimeters there&#39;s a over a hundred
million cells and up to a billion
different cells all different cells and
even though that they&#39;re mostly the same
within these cells there&#39;s small genetic
differences that make them respond to
drugs differently so if you may have a
drug that&#39;s able to kill off almost all
the cells right there could be a small
population of cells that doesn&#39;t respond
to drug and this ultimately is the
area that has resistance and takes over
the body so the key to carrying cancer
is to start use all these sort of
amazing from some therapies
interventions that we have early before
there are cancers have grown large
enough so that there&#39;s resistance clones
to be available ultimately the key to
curing cancer is early detection and
then to relieve we know that you know we
sort of know if you catch cancer early
you know people will do better and and
the sort of the numbers show that as
well for example when ovarian cancer in
ovarian cancer if the cancer is caught
early for example in stage one seventeen
out of a hundred patients are able to
survive at five years oh no that&#39;s
actually pretty good however if it&#39;s a
Stage four sorry I need to correct that
so an ovarian cancer if you catch the
cancer in stage four only seventeen
women out of 100 will survive so most of
the women die at five years however if
you&#39;re able to catch the cancer in stage
one ninety two percent of the women will
survive
so the key then is to catch ovarian
cancer early and catch these cancers
early because even with the drugs that
we have today people will already better
buy keep catching them in an earlier
stage but the sad fact for ovarian
cancer is only 15 of percent of women
are caught in stage one whereas the vast
majority 70 percent are caught in stages
three and four so the key is figuring
out ways we will detect cancer early and
be able to apply so what are the current
methods to detect cancer early oh and to
be able to do this the first one here is
a medical procedure so for example
colonoscopy for colon cancer it&#39;s you
know there&#39;s a medical procedure to put
in a tube to be able to see whether
there&#39;s cancer second one is using
protein biomarkers for example PSA for
prostate cancer the third one is imaging
sort of taking pictures and x-rays and
CT scans the most famous one is
mammography for breast cancer medical
procedures while there are you know the
gold standard they&#39;re great
thing is they&#39;re highly invasive and
know these procedures you do a lot to be
able to do and its infrastructure
intensive you need a big hospital you
need doctors you need to prep to be able
to do that protein markers only have the
other hand is furniture easy to do but
slow specificity meaning there&#39;s a lot
of false positives so with a false
positive then you know people are scared
they think that they have cancer but
they don&#39;t and they result in
unnecessary workups the third is imaging
imaging well you know great for some
uses struggle from radiation you don&#39;t
want to use it too much you can&#39;t do it
very often right because you&#39;re exposing
to harmful radiation which is ultimately
and causes cancer and then even more
it&#39;s not applicable to all populations
for example women in dense breasts we
need a method that is non-invasive that
is very light and infrastructure that&#39;s
highly specific what we need is a method
that is non-invasive that is very light
and infrastructure that is highly
specific does not cause does that use
harmful radiation and ultimately is
applicable to all populations does such
a technology exist
well I wouldn&#39;t have flown all the way
from the US if it doesn&#39;t I saw the
company natera we&#39;ve been working on
this technology and I&#39;m happy to sort of
tell you more about it so central to
this technology is a simple blood test
the blood circulatory system while
seemingly mundane is very very important
in sort of sustaining your life it
provides oxygen and nutrients to
yourselves and takes away carbon dioxide
and waste here&#39;s the key cancer cells
grow and die faster than normal cells
and when they die they should have DNA
which can be seen in the blood and from
the cancer genome projects we sort of we
know the signatures of these cancers so
then we can look in the blood for these
specific signatures in order to take
cancer early so instead of waiting for
cancers to be large enough so you can
visualize it on a medical procedure or
dense enough so you can see it on
imaging or significant enough that it
causes symptoms we can start looking
for cancers while it&#39;s still in very
small amounts by looking it for small
amounts of DNA in the blood so how do we
do this so the method starts off how&#39;s
your pretty simple we start off with a
simple blood draw no special material
and a special procedure a simple blood
draw
then we then separate out the cells from
the blood and look look at the DNA in
the plasma fraction most of the DNA
actually comes from your body is normal
and only a small amount of it comes from
the cancer the key is to be able to find
that small amount then we use a series
of molecular biology techniques so is
focus on the areas of DNA that we know
are important for the signatures of
cancer then we take the DNA that we&#39;ve
prepared put it in a DNA sequencer and
is able to read out and digitize these
DNA into letters a C&#39;s T&#39;s and G&#39;s
ultimately the output is billions of
letters of a C&#39;s T&#39;s and G&#39;s and we use
computational and statistical methods to
be able to find a small amount of signal
in the noise does this work yes and in
fact we are we&#39;re very excited that we
just published this data very recently
and was actually featured on the cover
of nature magazine which is one of the
top scientific magazines in our world we
started this by doing it in lung cancer
because we can not right now predict
who&#39;s going to get cancer yet we started
in a population that&#39;s second best is
focusing our populations in remission so
the sad fact is despite all that
technologies that we have lung cancer
after you&#39;re treated altima Lee comes
back so the the key then is for us to
measure the DNA in these patients under
the mission and see whether we can catch
these recurrences early working with
cancer Street Cancer Research UK
University College London led by dr.
Charlie Swan we just celebrated in the
UK and we were able to publish there&#39;s
this result so let me walk you example
of one patient so this patient starts
off with surgery at day zero and
ultimately has chemotherapy given and
then there&#39;s a time of waiting to see
you know this patient suppose it doesn&#39;t
have any cancer and it is ultimately
going to come back methods is imaging or
clinical visits and ultimately
unfortunately around day 450 that cancer
comes back during this whole time with
measuring blood serially we can then ask
whether is there CC is there DNA in the
blood then we can look at so in the
beginning when this during surgery
there&#39;s a high level of DNA from the
cancer in the blood which then goes to
goes to a very low amount of through
stuff so time points and ultimately
around day 340 there&#39;s a rise that we
see an amount of cancer DNA in the blood
eventually going up to higher and higher
amounts the key here is we are detecting
the rise of cancer DNA a day above 350
this is about a hundred days earlier
than clinical detection this is 100 days
potentially earlier they didn&#39;t give
treatments or therapies well more
importantly this is a hundred days less
for the cancer to grow resistant clones
and oftentimes 100 days for some cancer
patients can mean a difference between
life and death we&#39;ve been really excited
about this research we did in first
hundred patients 24 of them of which we
did know longitudinally we achieve a
sensitivity of 93% a specificity of 100%
and to some patients were catching these
cancers up to a year in advance excited
by all this data
we&#39;re started working in sort of later
data to be able to see in other cancer
types as well as in lung cancer we&#39;re
looking at breast cancer we&#39;re looking
in lung cancer and we&#39;re looking at
ovarian cancer and I can&#39;t wait to see
how much earlier we can catch these
cancers ultimately I have a dream a
dream of two tubes of blood that as part
of your annual visit to your doctor you
have you know two tubes of blood drawn
additional positron and using these two
two books to the blood we&#39;ll be able to
sequence all the DNA and compare it to
all known cancer signatures potentially
finding cancers days months and
potential years in advance even with the
therapies that we have today this could
mean that millions of lives
be saved this is the dream for patients
like like Roberto if this were available
to him potentially he would be with us
today so the next time when you hear the
word cancer I wanted to add to your
emotions of sadness and fear the emotion
about hope hang on millions of
researchers around the world are making
enormous strides in cancer research and
this is we&#39;re starting to see the
beginning of the end the end of near we
will win the war on cancer
