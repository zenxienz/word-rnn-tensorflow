I am a singer and I&#39;ll just be fair I&#39;m
just gonna try it my very bench and I&#39;m
obviously not very good but slight okay
my topic today I can&#39;t eat that thank
you for having me as a pleasure meeting
here I hope I don&#39;t waste your time yeah
so my conference today is about try so
I&#39;m I&#39;m all about doing what you want to
do what you believe that you&#39;re doing
your passion so I am a singer/songwriter
I&#39;ve been doing this about for about six
or seven years I knew it was something
that I wanted to do soon as you have I
saw the thing in the shower and started
watching YouTube and then you see all
these people doing covers and I thought
hey if because they weren&#39;t anybody
doing it at that time I wasn&#39;t sure of
who was doing a YouTube I couldn&#39;t find
any and I only already found like people
like Kyle of Wired Tori Kelly and all
these people doing these YouTube covers
on YouTube and I thought hey if they can
why can&#39;t I I had a camera and I decided
to okay you know let&#39;s record a cover
and start posting YouTube sorry about
that like anyway so
this is my first cover when you - I
would not recommend you guys to go back
and actually watch but feel free to uh
if you don&#39;t mind making your so yeah
this is my first I I would say that I
used to have people coming up to me up
like anonymously online telling me
things like okay stop singing do
everyone favorite stop singing well I I
used to think that and I feel really
upset and always tell me I would go
around telling my friends guys I don&#39;t
sing anymore from my drama queen like
you know fishing for compliments but
that never stopped me because I look
like from those criticisms from from
everything that I&#39;ve been true
everything I learned from them so I
wouldn&#39;t say I still wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m
the best singer ever I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m
a professional but I enjoyed I love what
I do
it is my happy field so I continued and
this is my other the most one of the
first most responsive cover attraction
that I&#39;ve gotten hit FM was playing it
was like hey that&#39;s not my so I
continued from there I people would tell
me when I&#39;m gonna read my first socket I
struggled I did not know how to write
science I keep telling myself I couldn&#39;t
I would say it&#39;s a very much that thing
if you keep telling yourself you can&#39;t
so I try I try can kind of so one day I
got my heart broken
typically picked up the guitar look
better they don&#39;t I&#39;m a hopeless
romantic so I
I wrote a letter to my eggs when we were
still together so I wrote this song
called side not psoas IgH sorry no man
in doing so this dog was my first ever
signal of you guys have been following
me for the very very beginning you might
may or may not know this song it&#39;s it&#39;s
about broken promises because I wrote
the song when I was in a relationship
about how about promises because I&#39;ve
always had this thinking people are
gonna leave a betterment issues kind of
thing so I wrote this song when you into
relationship thinking hey you&#39;re
actually here for me and that he broke
up with me and then so on so right so go
listen to the song okay this next stop
this next slide is of the most
successful talk that I have that has
been overplayed on radio I&#39;m sick of it
it&#39;s called okay yeah you guys know it
okay okay so this song was written about
people living believing and how I&#39;m okay
with that because people come and go but
it&#39;s all a learning process so like it&#39;s
a song that I&#39;m very proud of I have
more songs it&#39;s just so it&#39;s it&#39;s one of
my it&#39;s one of the songs that I&#39;m very
very proud of and and I can see it
because I tried
and here is a music video I went around
looking for people I was actually really
rushed because I guarantee my producer
released the song without me knowing
like just the tail but he sent me the
final then and then posted it the next
day and I&#39;m like oh no not the cooler
I&#39;m looking for someone doing a music
video I decided to make a music video so
I write based on personal experiences I
like sharing my emotions I like sherry
how I feel and everything expressing its
how I expressed and I wanted a dirty
video but I decided to make it a lyric
music videos because people officials so
I wanted their extent because I want
other people to know what I was singing
what I would say what I wanted to share
so that that was like okay the video is
how it is so everyone knows me as a
singer songwriter musician some may not
know what I do as well of what I enjoy
doing other than music I would say
rather unexpected do I look like someone
who yeah so hi I love sports
I most fitness junkie parkour athlete
rock climber power lifter
[Music]
brother sort of so yeah I like what all
that because that was the first part
that I&#39;ve ever picked up because in in
high school I was in the government
school for cheers they wouldn&#39;t be
supportive of girls doing like someone
physical sports so when I moved over to
KQ international I told myself one thing
was that I had to take up football or
football I know what I would be the only
girl on the field playing with everyone
else
I enjoyed it so I didn&#39;t stop I kept
trying I got better at it not actually
every Monday I still suck but you know I
enjoy the sport and so this is my first
sport I do parkour
do you guys recognize this bridge yeah
this is yeah yeah it&#39;s not evil don&#39;t do
this at home
yeah I don&#39;t know if we should be
sharing this this is I&#39;m Charlotte
senior I swear that the feel does not
look like that it looks a lot better now
and why I picked that worker was because
I got the working part time at each
happily Park I could do all sorts of
flips on the on the trampoline and
everything but I I was winning I was I
wasn&#39;t happy myself because I could not
do a flip on the ground
I was thinking huh I can show him only
in a time to meet Michael show it off
and brown and that was the one thing
that I wanted to do and I wanted you to
learn the back sweetheart drive so I
thought that learning
I think the people at dog Street helping
me flip and then I saw a whole bunch of
parkour kids coming in to try attitude
to play I Jump Street I didn&#39;t know them
sizes why not but teach me how to do a
backflip everyone just looked at me like
you serious this girl serious I see
crazy is it okay so from then on I
started learning with brand new
streamers ddq made friends from that
factor I&#39;ve been doing it almost
everywhere whenever I can
no I&#39;m not doing a backflip today so
from that I got to do my first backflip
on stage in people which was the main
reason why I didn&#39;t do the back step
so I was it was in accomplishments I
also do acro yoga or yoga like because
it&#39;s it&#39;s good it helps with all these
sports that I do I think your best of
everything
yeah just extra things so this is looks
a nice thing but beyond it I was beside
a road with cars passing by so I&#39;m like
you have to carry me out of it to get
out from it to carry me back cause like
a lot of pain so you don&#39;t think we do
Punk photos I said I&#39;m not only learning
yoga for this
I also rock-climb I used to go for
competitions I would say a handful of
sports so a jack of all trades and and I
run with VB thirsty a group Mir and
every Tuesdays I hate running with every
bit of my high cardio so bad I&#39;m
horrible idiot but uh my friend my
friend invited me to come for anything
and I thought okay not try not you know
to lose weight to keep fit about fitness
so I tried I I went I went for about
like probably one two months training to
run my first-ever half marathon a 20
foot 21 camp and one thing yeah so I did
it
I finished yeah
and last one is part of the thing I
don&#39;t have much photos of it but I&#39;m
joining a competition in August for
Carla thing I I&#39;ve only been training
for about two to three months now
I&#39;m 1495 Fiji I did this take 105 kg and
I&#39;m benching 50 kg yeah so so yeah I
like throwing that girls can too I like
sharing that if you try hard enough
you&#39;re able to do it no one can actually
stop you from doing what you want to do
to go to going out to do what you leave
it I mean you have to be kind of good
sometimes I&#39;ve been extent but I would
even try and from there you are able to
do what you want to do because if you
like what you if you enjoy what you&#39;re
doing you&#39;re able to give your all yeah
yeah this first song that I&#39;ll be
singing is an urgent all the songs I&#39;m
really proud of the hill it&#39;s called ok
