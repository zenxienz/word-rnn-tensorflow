so just be on my family&#39;s farm they say
you can see the curvature of the earth
the red Plains seemed to stretch out
forever on the hot summer days
Willie Willie&#39;s also known as dust
devils dance across the horizon when the
rains do eventually come
dazzling electrical storms light up the
night sky and thousands of desert acres
are submerged under life bringing water
to the untrained eye the expansive
interior might look deserted and
lifeless but this is where farmers like
my family raise livestock nurtured from
the land and in turn nourishing you and
for those who have witnessed the
migration of a thousand emerald budgies
who have seen the snow fields of white
paper daisies or heard the groans of the
river red gums when the ephemeral creeks
start to flow it is undeniable that this
land breathes and evolves as the seasons
change but this ecosystem is fragile an
eggshell of interdependent and symbiotic
relationships and the combined
challenges of feeding a growing global
population ecosystem degradation and
climate change ask more of farmers than
ever before
and so the protection of these delicate
environments rural communities and food
production systems is paramount and I
believe sustainable farming is key in
ensuring a vibrant and resilient future
for all of us and that means a food
system without fragmentation and one
that we all take care of and by now I&#39;m
sure some of you are sitting back
thinking cool farmers I&#39;m not a farmer
bring on the next speaker well I want to
challenge your responsibility because
each and every one of us plays a role in
the food system and the choices you make
when you eat do impact media and here&#39;s
why
you might have heard the term planetary
boundaries these are the land ocean
atmosphere and biodiversity parameters
that define a safe operating space for
Humanity and like the naughty kid on the
playground we&#39;ve tested pushing those
boundaries of our loving mother earth
you know we wondered what it would be
like if we cooked the planet a little
and killed off a few species here and
there well we now know that wasn&#39;t
appropriate behavior and we&#39;re kind of
being reprimanded for it these are some
of the big predicaments we now find
ourselves in by this time tomorrow there
will be nearly a quarter of a million
new mouths to feed
great if you own a restaurant not so
great if you&#39;re the food producer tasked
with growing more meat patties and
quinoa and I say it&#39;s not great for the
farmer because the world is currently
losing productive land arable land
pastures and forests are disappearing
and at a rate that far outpaces the
Earth&#39;s natural ability to replenish
diminished areas now let&#39;s throw climate
change on to the farmers plate who
already tried to produce more with less
floods bushfires and altered rainfall
patterns are pretty bad for farmers
particularly those who walk the
tightrope of life in the developing
nations when I&#39;m not at home in dusty
shipyards I spend a lot of my time in
the lush rice paddies of Southeast Asia
as well as being a farmer I am also an
agricultural researcher because as land
managers we know we need to continually
seek new information a better
understanding of how our world works and
the human interaction with it and my
research takes me to places much poorer
than here it shocks me when these
farmers that I work with in Southeast
Asia tell me the number of days that the
dry season is extending each year when
they describe to me the insects that
they see eating their crops that they
had never seen before they know exactly
how their climate and their world is
changing and although there is a
tempting self delusion that hunger
plagues and forced migration are fears
for lesser mortals let&#39;s be clear
climate change is an ugly beast it
impacts farmers around the globe as they
work closest to the land it is impacting
them now and what effects food producers
affects you in the audience who are
hanging out for a kebab after the show
but if farmers have the skills the
knowledge and support structures in
place they can do amazing things and
using a food analogy here with the right
ingredients
Mama&#39;s hold the key to healthy
environments that produce nourishing
food and support prosperous and vibrant
communities and it&#39;s you guys who choose
those ingredients you equip farmers with
the capacity to make change and to do
what they do best and that begins by
understanding the farming story and how
you play a role within it
farmers are other custodian stew a lot
of land they manage the basic building
block of life the soil and when it is
managed properly we reduce salinity
erosion and enhance that as a carbon
store farmers play a pivotal role in
nitrogen and phosphorus flow the
improved fertilizer use efficiency and
the capture and return of nutrients to
the soil not only leads to healthier
soils but a healthier coastline and a
healthier atmosphere and on this land
farmers live and work alongside plants
and animals agriculture supports and is
supported by these living creatures the
pollinators that ensure our harvests the
mosaic of pastures that hold down our
soils the trees that provide wildlife
habitats and this life is dependent on
high-quality rivers and aquifers to
sustain it water management on-farm
and beyond the farm boundary fence is
key to proper ecosystem functioning and
with such precious assets at stake we
need to adopt an attitude of shared
responsibility taking only what one
needs and no more and this goes for our
food as well farmers can help us
respect our food by educating us on the
time and resources that go into
producing it with their help we can
reduce food loss and wastage and banish
ridiculous cosmetic standards like the
perfect red apple farmers have long fed
and closed the weld and I think it&#39;s
time we help power it as well they are
in parcels of land that can host solar
panels and wind turbines they produce
biomass that can be used not only to run
their businesses but provide them with a
secondary and stable source of income by
putting that renewable energy back into
the grid strong farming businesses mean
wider social stability building
resilience into rural communities
generates employment markets and
services and as our society progresses
strategies and policies that promote
businesses closely attuned to the
natural world means a stronger economy
for you and me and whichever angle that
I look at tackling these big challenges
of feeding a hungry --oh world with
reduced environmental footprint it keeps
coming back to farmers the role they
play in looking after the soils the
water our economy and communities and in
turn the support and capacity that we as
a wider society give our farmers to do
that my family purchased our Outback
Sheep station in the year 2000 the start
of the decade-long millennium drought a
word for the Y&#39;s not the best time to
buy a farm it was immediately apparent
to us how interconnected different
components of the farming system are as
we all know when the rain doesn&#39;t fall
all less vegetation grows livestock are
sold at reduced weights and crop yields
are not achieved less money in the
farmers pocket means they search for a
farm employment and shops in rural towns
closed for you food quality goes down
and prices go up knowing that this
region that I hold so dear is becoming
hotter and drier with more frequent and
intense dust storms drives me to build
resilience and sustainability into our
farm model just like farmers all around
the world who stand at the coal face of
life&#39;s macro challenges as an industry
we have achieved remarkable things we
have built a powerful foundation of
wisdom and/or inspiring technology our
livestock have greater survival rates
and are producing less methane soil
sensors provide real-time data that we
can immediately respond to and draw the
gathering aerial imagery of crop health
helping us to water better and control
weeds more accurately and this is
happening in the paddocks today in the
future census automation engineering and
genetics will only be more impressive
and as we come to realise the urgency
for this change we will see a surge of
inventiveness that will create solutions
that are languishing in their infancy or
even yet to be dreamed of it is exciting
to see new breeds new management
practices new technologies
revolutionising the way farmers produce
food fiber and energy my vision of the
future is where farms have long-range
weather forecasting and advanced tele
Communications so we can make
well-informed decisions they are
businesses run on renewable energy and
where no food is wasted unnecessarily
but I need you guys to help create that
future because while finite resources
are still being plundered while our
natural landscapes are still being
polluted while there is still
fragmentation within our food system we
must realize there is no room for apathy
there is no luxury of time for
complacency I have no doubt that we can
all live well now and into the future
within the means of one planet but only
if we are conscious of our shared
responsibility and with knowledge that
farmers are the link to the land to our
food and to vibrant and prosperous
communities sure the world is a complex
place but as I learned during the
millennium drought everything is
connected in fact if you pull out a
single thread of life you will find it
is attached to everything else and
because of this interconnectivity you
here today play a critical role you
drive the farmers production by choosing
what to eat you manage the natural
resources by deciding to finish your
meal or to throw it out your use of
energy and the source of where that is
generated from determines the pollution
that is or is not put into our skies and
your vote sets the policies and the
trajectory of our common future
in essence it is your engagement with
the farming story that shapes our
industry
and the world in which we live thank you
