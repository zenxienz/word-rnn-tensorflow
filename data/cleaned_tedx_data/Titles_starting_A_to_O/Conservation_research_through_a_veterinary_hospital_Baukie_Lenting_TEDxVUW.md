hi everyone my name is bokya I&#39;m the
senior vet at Wellington Zoo and I&#39;m
really excited to be
this evening with you guys so I came to
vintner E science because my passion has
always always been working with animals
wildlife and conservation I think my
parents knew pretty early on that I was
going to go in that direction because
there&#39;s a small child that would
sometimes be late to school because I&#39;d
be busy saving worms out of rain puddles
on rainy days as a teenager I brought
home a series of unusual animals that
needed rearing and rehabilitating and
almost half the photos throughout my
childhood have me holding an animal of
some kind so as my mum would say there
was never a dull moment so I went
through vet school self-proclaimed bird
nerd and wildlife enthusiast and I
graduated with a B VSC with distinction
I was really keen to get into the
wildlife and conservation field so after
two years in private practice I did a
residency in avian wildlife in zoo
animal health and it was this residency
that made me realize both how much I
loved New Zealand wildlife how
incredible our wildlife is and also how
a lot of our species are in a lot of
trouble and need all the help they can
get so today I&#39;d like to introduce you
to the kind of conservation work and the
kind of scientific discoveries that can
be achieved through a veterinary
Wildlife Hospital like ours the mystic
Kohanga was opened in 2009 and as
wellington zoo&#39;s animal hospital and a
real conservation hub it provides
victory care for all the animals living
in the zoo and also for injured wildlife
that gets brought in an important
feature is that all the work that we do
is on display so our zoos visitors
through large viewing windows and our
staff are miked up whenever we&#39;re
working so if I&#39;m working with a patient
I can talk to our visitors about what it
is that we&#39;re doing and they can ask me
whatever questions they need about
what&#39;s wrong with the patient what we&#39;re
doing or what we do at our Hospital in
general our wildlife patients come from
Wellington and they come from further
afield around New Zealand they arrive
injured or unwell and we treat them so
that they treat them and rehabilitate
them so that they can be returned back
into the wild we treat four to five
hundred patients every year so that
keeps us busy and we treat a real range
of species so everything from penguins
to parrots
from our tiny latest inks and geckos
into atera to our Kiwi and from species
that are in decline two species that are
highly endangered so you can imagine
with that number of wildlife patients
coming into our hospital but a huge
amount of data comes and with them and
this is the first important way in which
we can perform conservation work through
our hospital so this data comes in the
form of blood test results x-ray images
so radiographs of our patients and other
diagnostic results from Diagnostics that
we might perform it comes in the form of
what diseases or injuries these patients
are diagnosed with where they&#39;ve come
from what time of year it is and how
they respond to our treatments this is
this is an important opportunity to
learn from all this data because for a
lot of our wildlife patients for a lot
of our species not everything is yet
known about them there are huge huge
gaps and even some very basic knowledge
around their anatomy physiology and
pharmacokinetics so how drugs work and
other different different other fields
as well so sorry so there&#39;s this mess of
gifts in our knowledge so if you compare
this to human medicine or medicine of
veterinary medicine of domestic animals
when we&#39;re working with wildlife we work
with more unknowns we often have to
apply treatments or Diagnostics very
very carefully and sometimes we have to
extrapolate from closely related species
and all of these all of these approaches
have have a degree of inaccuracy with
them so an important scientific venture
for a wildlife hospital like ours is to
collect all that data coming in record
it analyze it and share it so that we
can keep growing a basic knowledge of
wildlife medicine for our own native
species so an example of this would be
if 50 years ago you took an x-ray
picture of a Kiwi estat Kiwi that came
in if there was something really obvious
like a broken leg you just fought that
pretty quickly but for some of the more
subtle changes you&#39;d have nothing to
refer back to like you would for if you
took a dog or a cat there&#39;d be a big
atlas
to compare it to but 50 years ago for
our Kiwi they&#39;d be almost nothing to
refer to so after decades and in the
past few years a lot of Wildlife
hospitals around the country have
accumulated large banks of normal x-rays
of our Kiwi as if we so now when a Kiwi
comes in you can just look back through
other x-ray images and that tiny little
double that you&#39;re wondering is that
normal or is it not you can say yep
that&#39;s prisons and all that other Kiwis
nothing to worry about so that&#39;s helpful
it&#39;s also important I think to let
people know that there are these gaps in
our knowledge in our native wildlife
medicine so that we can inspire other
people to our exciting field so I was in
our laboratory the other day I was
looking at a smear of blood that I&#39;d
taken from one of our wildlife patients
and there was a small boy he was 5 years
old he was very young and he was asking
these incredible questions like what are
those cells look like what are they do
what are their biochemical functions and
I had to say to him
eventually but I&#39;m really sorry we
didn&#39;t actually know the answers to
these incredible questions of yours so
maybe when you grow up you can look
those up and you can tell us so looking
forward to seeing his research proposal
in 20 years time using our wildlife data
in that way helps us to help individual
wildlife patients we can you also use it
we can also use it to think bigger to
population health and conservation of
whole populations because over years and
years of treating individual wildlife
patients patterns start to emerge so
which diseases or injuries are common in
which species or at certain times of
year other diseases or injuries that are
associated with wildlife living in an
urban setting and are there diseases
that are changing in frequency
increasing are there emerging diseases
so for example in the Wellington region
serious injuries as a result of flying
into windows or cars are common in our
kiru large endemic wood pigeon injuries
as a result of entanglement in fishing
debris are common in pyj eggs as certain
species of endemic cormorant these guys
come into the clinic and they have
fishing line tangled around their wings
or legs fishing hooks in their mouths
and in their stuff
they&#39;re horrible conditions which are
very frequently fatal beacon bone
deformities are common in very young
North Island khakha are endemic forest
parrot as they&#39;re growing in the nest
and that&#39;s probably the result of being
fed an unbalanced diet while they&#39;re
growing in the nest so you can very
quickly see patterns like this can help
us to advise on the health of a
population or identified disease risks
or injury risks that are affecting a
population sharing this data with the
Department of Conservation might lead to
changes in conservation management or
species planning and sharing it with the
City Council might result in changes in
City Planning and very frequently I have
our visitors to the zoo asking me it&#39;s
horrible to see this patient so unwell
what can I do to help and we can use our
population data to advise individuals
and small changes that they can make in
their everyday life that will help our
wild populations in the Wellington
region and further afield so clean up
fishing tackle that you use or find to
help our pied shakes look at the window
visibility and layout of your homes to
help our Keira roof and don&#39;t feed
Parker human foods so that they feed
their chicks a balanced diet so that
they grow strong and healthy chicks a
third way that we can use our data for
conservation and work is to think even
bigger still one health is the concept
that the fields of animal health
environmental health and human health
have many many interconnections so much
so that factors affecting one might
affect the others also so there might be
findings in our wildlife data that have
implications for human house and for
environmental health so an example of
this is that in the last few decades
it&#39;s become apparent that LED toxicity
is a very common finding in our native
wildlife as it is over seeds lead is
used by humans and a number of different
things and some activities we do with it
leaves it exposed for wildlife to get in
contact with and if wildlife adjusts its
or eats it that can make them very
unwell can cause toxicity it can cause
illness and it can cause death
so in a New Zealand setting birds of
prey can encounter lead if they&#39;re
scavenging small prey species they can
ingest any lead shot that they may
contain I need a waterfowl I can pick up
small pieces of lead from our waterways
as they&#39;re feeding from the sediment of
our waterways then in a Wellington
sitting native car cut with their big
beaks and their boundless curiosity and
it sure on a number of things sometimes
because it&#39;s functional sometimes
because it&#39;s fun and they can just live
that way and can become very unwell as
well a new finding though is that tui in
the Wellington region so our large
endemic honeyeater is are also getting
lead toxicity and we don&#39;t know where
they&#39;re getting it from till we use
feeding strategy is quite different from
those other birds so it&#39;s likely that
the source is different to where those
other birds are getting lead from I
think it&#39;s very important and also very
interesting to try and figure out where
to we&#39;re getting this lid from but first
of all so if we know the source we can
reduce the to ease access to it and make
lest we become unwell from the lead
poisoning and secondly thinking along
the lines of one house this unknown
source in our Wellington environment may
have implications for human health and
for environmental health as well so
recently we&#39;ve embarked on a research
project which is just started with
Nessie University so we&#39;re trying to
find out the source where are the
targeting the slid from and I&#39;m really
excited to see what we&#39;re going to find
and how we can apply that to make a
difference for conservation for
Wellington collaboration like this is a
fourth way in which wildlife hospitals
can contribute to conservation
so we collaborate with groups like the
Department of Conservation New Zealand
universities as in India other
conservation groups laboratories in the
zoo&#39;s collaboration conservation
requires the coming together of all
kinds of different fields and
professions because the field of
conservation is huge and the science
contained within that is both very very
specific and very broad so we need to
keep
groups invested in conservation
communicating well together working well
together so we that leads to faster and
better science and better conservation
outcomes I think of teaching as being
included in collaborations our vet
hospital we teach vet students and VIP
nursing students our basic clinical
skills before they head out into the
world and we work together again with
Mercer University to develop a master
program in inventory science so
postgraduate program where graduated
vets work together with us to learn more
about avian wildlife and zoo animal
health and it&#39;s really great to see
these people that we&#39;ve worked with and
that we&#39;ve taught them that we&#39;ve
learned from heading out into the world
and this wonderful large collaborative
network of knowledge that results
sometimes collaboration can also come
from our visitors so we&#39;ve got our
intercom system while we&#39;re working and
we&#39;ve had people hop on there and say
hey I&#39;m a human anesthetist we what
drugs are you using on the patient
you&#39;re an exercising today or hey I&#39;m a
wildlife it from overseas these issues
that you&#39;re describing affecting your
wildlife affect ours also and we have
some other interesting findings along
those lines
so each introduction like that from a
range of professions and people from
different walks of life
I&#39;m very interesting but also each of
those introductions can be a new point
for more collaboration and better
conservation outcomes a final way in
which I think a vintner Wildlife
Hospital can do conservation work is by
inspiring action in our local
communities so we have wonderful people
bringing us injured wildlife we come
with wonderful stories like they&#39;ve been
driven all the way from Otaki with a
ninja Delbert us in the back of the car
or we had a person who missed their
ferry crossing because they stop pull
over the side of the road and rescued a
clutch of orphan paradise ducklings from
the side of the road and brought them to
our VIP hospital and it&#39;s it&#39;s these
people and it&#39;s our visitors who we can
I think through showing them the work
that we do so when we&#39;re working with a
patient showing them how incredible
these patients are how incredible our
the birds of birds-of-prey how amazing
their talons are
how beautiful the feathers the
iridescent feathers of our kiru and our
tui
and I think showing people giving people
those those magical encounters and
combining that with explaining that this
is an incredible species but these are
the issues affecting them in the wild
and I think that&#39;s a really neat little
package to send people home with
inspires change in action in our
community so that&#39;s a very quick tour a
very quick introduction to the kind of
conservation work and the kind of
scientific discoveries that can be
achieved through veterinary wildlife
hospital we treat hundreds of patients
every year and this allows us to advise
on individual patient health on
population health and potentially also
on environmental and human health
wildlife health is important the
contribution that wildlife health can
make to conservation and to the concept
of one health is really important
and also important I think is inspiring
people from all professions and walks of
life so become interested in science
wildlife and conservation because
conservation is a huge field and it
requires much collaboration it needs all
of us universities and vet hospitals
doctors and ecologists politicians and
little kids who pick up worms on the way
to school and anyone else interested in
the health of our wildlife the health of
our environment and the health of our
communities thank you
[Applause]
you
