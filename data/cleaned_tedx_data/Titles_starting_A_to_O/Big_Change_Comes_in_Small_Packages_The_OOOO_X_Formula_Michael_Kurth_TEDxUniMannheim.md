thank you all in the very beginning I
would like to say thank you because you
are already giving a gift you are giving
one of the most precious things you can
actually give to yourself or to another
person you might not be aware that
you&#39;re giving this gift actually you are
very aware that you&#39;re giving this gift
but you&#39;re not aware that you&#39;re aware
that you&#39;re giving this gift what I&#39;m
talking about I will save this for the
end because what is a talk without a
cliffhanger
right so we mean one of those to start
this off I would like to enter with a
little experiment this little experiment
is going to take about 75 seconds of
your precious time so I would invite you
to join me in this experiment if you&#39;re
a little reluctant don&#39;t worry I hope
nothing bad is gonna happen okay now if
you with me for this little experiment I
would invite you to just close your eyes
for a few moments so we can all close
eyes together just for a few moments and
as we have our eyes closed just bring
your attention into your body just see
how are you sitting on the chair how are
your feet feeling on the ground maybe
you&#39;re holding something in your hand
just notice what&#39;s going on in your body
there&#39;s no need to interpret or tell a
story about it just get a feeling for
how you feel and then a moment I would
like to invite you to take three deep
breaths with me and here&#39;s the good news
we all have eyes closed so if you like
to move your body for taking a breath or
if you aloud if you want to exhale
loudly you can do so cuz nobody will
know who the hell did that right so you
can just relax yourself so we&#39;ll just
take three deep breaths and when the
breath comes in you can really feel your
chest and your belly expanding when it
comes out you can feel it contracting
let&#39;s just do that together for a few
moments okay here we go
[Applause]
see you can see I&#39;m breathing loudly I
don&#39;t care and a third one the last one
and as you do your last exhale just keep
your eyes closed for a moment and feel
into your body again just notice how
you&#39;re feeling and then we can open our
eyes together again now if your
experience is at all a little bit like
my experience here&#39;s what just happened
after just breathing deliberately and
attentively three times you feel a
little bit more relaxed you feel a
little bit more calm and you feel a
little bit more at home in your physical
body by paying attention to what you&#39;re
doing the explanation for that is simple
by just breathing deliberately you are
sending signals to your brain to reduce
the production of stress hormones like
cortisol so that calms you down a little
bit your heart rate slows down a little
bit so your pulse becomes a little lower
and if you have feelings or thoughts of
anxiety or fear by just breathing
deliberately you can reduce them a
little tiny bit now this happens if you
take three deep breaths right so my
point here is this sometimes it can be
very simple usually when we&#39;re talking
about making change or turning our life
around or achieving something or
becoming more happy or more calm or
something we&#39;re usually talking about
making big shifts we want to turn a life
around a hundred percent or at least 75
percent right and this sometimes can
also add more stress because where do we
start what do we do and I&#39;m here to
propose the idea that sometimes five
percent is enough why well I will also
keep this for the end you know another
cliffhanger I would like to tell you
just in a couple of sentences about
myself I used to be the 100% guy right I
still am a little bit but not as much as
was before always the 100% guy when I
was very young I discovered rap music
and this to me was the greatest thing in
the world
so I wanted to be a rapper I started
writing everyday I started investing all
my free time and everything into being a
rapper and during this excitement I
developed an idea and the idea was when
I become a rapper I will be happy so I
became a rapper and I started releasing
albums and I started going on tours and
I collaborated with people I
collaborated with people that I had my I
collaborated collaborated with the
wu-tang clan and different people you
know so the whole time I&#39;m thinking
happiness right this is gonna make me
happy so before a release of our first
album I said when I released my first
album I&#39;ll be happy and after my first
album I said no when I get this tour
done I&#39;ll be happy and this kept on
going and going and going in this
happiness never really appeared for a
substantial amount of time I got to the
point where I was so feeling burned out
and so feeling disillusioned that I quit
at the moment where I just had my most
successful single I said this is it
I quit what did I do being the 100% guy
I wanted to turn my life completely
around right I wanted to see I wanted to
find happiness so what do you do when
you want to turn your life around and
find happiness instead of just like
looking at yourself you go across the
globe so I went to India you know and I
and I went into an ashram and I was
wearing a robe and I was dancing and
jumping with like a thousand people and
it was crazy and was fantastic it was
great and I went on meditation retreats
and I started training as a systemic
coach all this stuff I did all of this
and it&#39;s all great but I met this one
person who was very wise and I was very
happy to meet him early along the way
and he said look you have this rap music
day thing you think it&#39;s gonna make you
happy so you run in that direction right
you run and you run and you don&#39;t find
happiness you turn around and what are
you doing now you&#39;re running running
running with your juices just running in
another direction maybe the problem is
not the music maybe the problem is the
running if you slow down a little bit
maybe you will notice that these things
do you see to the left and to the right
these green flashes they are actually
trees and then you&#39;re like oh there&#39;s
trees I never saw those before and then
you get a little courage and you walk a
little slower and then you smell the
trees for the first time it&#39;s like oh
yeah this is nice
and then when you&#39;re very courageous you
stop and when you stop you take a deep
breath like we did in the beginning and
maybe you realize there&#39;s nothing that
you have to run away from so when I
heard this I said yeah cool thank you
that&#39;s fine that&#39;s for you that&#39;s not
for me I&#39;m the 100% guy right but it
stuck with me a little bit so in the
time after I started to think can I do
this can i integrate being a father
being a rapper being a coach doing all
this stuff can I integrate this and can
I use little steps and little things 5%
here 5% there lil something here list
something there to create a lasting
change and this is pretty much what I
want to talk about now none of these
ideas that I&#39;m going to share with you
are new I didn&#39;t invent any of this
stuff this is just something that really
works for me and that I found and I did
a little research and I found out that
most of the stuff is all of this stuff
actually it&#39;s backed by science and some
of it has been around for thousands of
years and has worked for many people and
I would like to start at the beginning
the first thing in the morning when you
wake up what do you do if you&#39;re at all
like me you stop your alarm clock and
your alarm clock usually happens to be
in this little box called your phone so
you press the button on your phone right
now from this movement to this movement
a small step for man but a big step for
mankind right so you swipe to the right
and you unlock your phone and what
happens then you look at the news you
see what these crazy people are doing
out there that you don&#39;t personally know
but you have the feeling that something
very wrong with the world then you go to
Facebook or some other social media
network and you see what these crazy
people that you know personally are
doing and you really have the feeling
something&#39;s wrong with the world and to
give it a nice little roundup you check
your emails and then when you check your
emails you will find out there&#39;s a lot
of things
that didn&#39;t get done yesterday there&#39;s a
lot of things you have to do today and
you feel like there&#39;s something wrong
with you right this is what you do the
first thing in the morning and then you
wonder right about the rest of the day
so the first proposal is this just in
the beginning in the morning create what
I like to call the open space just make
the decision for 10 minutes 15 minutes
if you really brave 30 minutes to not
engage in the effects of social social
media and news and email input you can
put this off for 30 minutes though your
world is probably not gonna collapse you
should try it out if it collapses you
can give me a call and tell me you know
and if you create this open space you
have time to reflect inwards and what
you will realize is that a lot of your
thoughts are about lack a lot of your
thoughts are about things that are not
there in your life this is because our
brain has a so called negativity bias I
guess it comes from the time where we
were chased by mammoths so it was more
important to see the mammoths that&#39;s
changing us then to smell the beautiful
flowers you know that&#39;s fine it&#39;s a
human trait but it leads to the fact
that we filter out negative information
and negative thoughts and we declare
them to be more important than the
positive ones this can help us when we
are in survival mode but sometimes in
our daily life it can be a little
difficult now since it&#39;s something
biological we can&#39;t turn it off we can&#39;t
cut it off but what we can do is we can
substitute it with something we can
lovingly place something to accompany it
and this is the practice of gratitude
practicing gratitude is something that
kind of struck me as a surprise but it&#39;s
been looked at it&#39;s been scientifically
examined and what happens to your brain
when you practice gratitude and you can
do this in the form of a journal for
example you can get up in the morning
use this open space and just write three
things you were grateful for what sounds
a little yeah wishy-washy actually does
something to your brain because it puts
a consistent information to your brain
saying hey let&#39;s consistently look for
something that we&#39;re grateful for you
know it focuses you on things that are
already there
that you don&#39;t need to be a smarter
person for you don&#39;t need to be a more
successful person you don&#39;t need to lose
weight you don&#39;t need to be more
brilliant you don&#39;t need to change your
life these things are already there for
you as you are now to use a little
metaphor I don&#39;t know I bought a car and
since I&#39;m a rap star I have to buy a big
car so I bought a Ford Fiesta
I bought a white Ford Fiesta and once I
bought it I was driving car on the
street and all of these white Ford
Fiestas starting appearing I don&#39;t know
if you know this but it&#39;s because I kind
of by buying the car I gave my brain the
information a white Ford Fiesta is
something that you should be looking at
does it mean there were more white Ford
Fiestas on the street probably not but I
noticed them one this is what happens
when you do gratitude practice are there
going to be more things that make you
grateful I don&#39;t know maybe not but they
come more into your focus and this
change is the whole perspective on life
now I come to the third thing we&#39;re
talking about what&#39;s going on in your
brain and how your emotions are working
and negativity bias and so on there is
actually a system that is incredibly
well proven for you to get a glimpse at
what is going on in this whole structure
that you call me in your thoughts and
your emotions it&#39;s a system we can all
use and it&#39;s been around for thousands
of years and it can bring clarity a
little clarity to what&#39;s going on and
it&#39;s called meditation right now some
people will say I don&#39;t meditate you
know maybe I some here in the room I
have news for you you did meditate about
10 minutes ago you meditate it when you
just sat down focused on your body and
deliberately felt your breath this is a
very simple kind of meditation it&#39;s
almost already a very sophisticated
Buddhist meditation named schemata all
you have to do is you have to sit or lay
down or stand up focus on your breath
and every time your thoughts come in you
just recognize your thoughts you don&#39;t
go into battle with them and then you
return to your breath and you use your
breath as the anchor to always return
into the present moment
and to not get so caught up in all these
thoughts but at the same time you
realize these thoughts and sometimes you
even realize oh this is what I&#39;ve been
thinking all the time this is what&#39;s
going on and so on is the one and this
introduced is also a little humor into
your life because when you catch
yourself thinking silly things over and
over again after some time you don&#39;t
identify with it so much but you can
laugh about it and I think humor is a
probably the best way to approach life
in a lot of circumstances and you can
always use your breath as an anchor and
this brings me to the fourth point the
body usually we separate this if I want
to lose 20 pounds I exercise right if I
want maybe maybe I exercise if I want to
change the behavior or something I&#39;ll do
something in my brain with my emotions
or my thoughts but of course we all know
these two are connected you can&#39;t
separate them and the way you think and
what&#39;s going on in your mind influences
your body and how you feel but it&#39;s also
the other way around the way you move
your body the way you connect with your
body it does something to how you feel
to your mood once again I don&#39;t want to
rattle off all the positive effects of
exercise because then I&#39;ll see all of
you too and pushups right away but it is
not just a physical thing that is
separated from your thought from your
thoughts or your emotions if you move
your body if you use your body not only
as a machine but as a source of joy it
can do great things for your mind state
and for your mood as well and this
brings me to the final point the body is
a wonderful way to take these practices
into your daily life because you can sit
and stare at a wall in Zen meditation
for 30 minutes that&#39;s fine
but you have to integrate this somehow
into your daily life so you can use your
bodily expression to do this for example
you pick one mundane thing like brushing
your teeth so you get up you brush your
teeth but you do it very mindfully you
bring your full attention in your full
presence into it you feel how it feels
and not only that you also feel what&#39;s
around you you hear the sounds from the
other rooms and so on so this brings
this attention this attentive quality in
this observing quality into a daily
ritual and it can be you
so your body can be used as a bridge
sort of to take this meditation practice
and this mindfulness practice into your
daily life now I&#39;ve put these things
together because they&#39;re they&#39;re a
little hard to remember into this little
formula that was the right button but
the wrong one here it is all right and I
call it 400 plus X just so I can
remember it easier the first one is the
open space that I talked about in the
morning right create yourself for open
space this media thing don&#39;t do it the
second one is obrigada which is
Portuguese for thank you and this is
about the gratitude practice may be in
the form of a gratitude journal the
third one ohm is very obvious right
it&#39;s about meditation the fourth one is
odd cha now autre is the Japanese word
for tea and I chose this because I love
Japanese tea and every time I make a tea
for myself I use this as a sort of
active meditation and the last one is
the X for exercise I kind of you know
squeeze that one out there now sometimes
it can be very simple and does this
thing or these things that I&#39;ve
mentioned do they turn your life around
100% next week maybe not do they turn
your life around at least 75% next week
maybe not but you can do something
consistently 5% here and 5% tomorrow and
5% the day after tomorrow and this is my
last point I would like to illustrate
this and if I go a little over time I&#39;m
a good company because the person that
the person that told this story in his
TED talk he also went over time his name
is Tony Robbins and he&#39;s an American
coach and I know nothing about golf so
I&#39;ll have to take Tony&#39;s word for it but
he tells a story about how he learned
golf so he&#39;s on the golf course and he&#39;s
trying to you know I guess you hit the
ball to where the flag is
right you know so he&#39;s trying to hit the
ball and the ball flies a couple of
hundred meters off the flag and he gets
frustrated any things I have to change
the way I stand I have to change the way
I swing I have to change the wind I have
to change my shoes and he gets
frustrated and his coach says Tony
relax you are one millimeter too much to
the right and he said what do you mean
one millimeter in he says well look at
this if you hit the ball here one
millimeter more to the left in the
trajectory of the next hundreds of
metres it will make a huge difference so
5% today 5% tomorrow 5% next week will
add up to it depends on how long you
practice it for her but you don&#39;t have
to turn everything around 100% you can
just do little things deliberately and
you can create a big lasting change so
once again I would like to thank you for
this great gift that you have given me
which of course is your attention
because everything that we put our
attention on is something that will
unravel in front of us and we will
understand what&#39;s going on there and
then we can do something about it
so I would like to thank you for this
and I hope that the next time we see
each other all of our little golf balls
will be a couple of meters more to where
the flag is
thank you very much
[Applause]
