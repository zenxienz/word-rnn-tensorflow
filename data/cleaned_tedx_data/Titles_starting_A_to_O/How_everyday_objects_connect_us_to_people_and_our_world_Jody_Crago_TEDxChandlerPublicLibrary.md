my talk today is about the objects of my
obsession how everyday objects connect
us to people our community and the world
I&#39;ve worked in history museums for 25
years all across the country from
Pennsylvania to Maryland Indiana to
Illinois and now Arizona I also come
from a place Mieville Pennsylvania that
I like to call the crossroads of history
because so much happened there or at
least passed through there
the first lieutenant George Washington
when he told the French to get out of
North America because it was English
land all her Hazard Perry who built a
Armada and met the British in the war of
1812 John Brown who began his career in
abolition in a small Church where he
signed an abolitionist pledge Edwin
Drake who drilled well and found oil for
the first time and changed our world
Gideon&#39;s son back the man who invented
the hookless fastener or as we know it
the zipper and even channellocks
something that many of us have in our
garage today all of these things come
from my hometown all of these things
would be the things that touch the world
change who we are but that&#39;s not what my
story is about my story is about a
little boy who with his dad on a sunny
afternoon in the backyard had quite an
adventure so first you&#39;ll see this photo
yes that&#39;s me standing on top of a large
dirt pile we were planting trees in the
backyard
my dad had dug down about three foot and
he came upon this a little car knowing
that I was very anxious to help but not
being much help through the car up to me
and said here this is yours and I said
how on earth did this get down three
foot into the ground
I asked why why is this car here if we
build our house here the first people to
build our house my dad being that tire
salesman not knowing any better decided
to give the best advice that a husband
could give and he said go ask your mom
now I did that went into the house
talked to my mom my mom being a nurse
didn&#39;t really have the answer either but
she knew it was something that she
wanted to inspire me to encourage me to
find out and so she took me to the one
place she thought would have the answer
the Crawford County Historical Society
they&#39;re a willing staff member listen to
this little boy and said you know what
let&#39;s start to look took down books took
down histories eventually finding a land
ownership map and said yes indeed there
was a property owner there that very
quickly led me to this house and what
from that house I discovered a family
that in 1950 a small little boy lost
this midget toys race car this little
car when I began to look into the car I
discovered it was from Rockford Illinois
by a tool-and-die manufacturer that
after world war ii needed to build
something with aluminum and so they
chose to go into cars in other toys toys
that cost just simply ten cents this is
another one of those everyday objects
that you may look at and think what is
this insignificant yes you may look at
this envelope and say why would someone
save this is it the stamp in the corner
was someone trying to save the stamp or
was it just because look it&#39;s from 1943
maybe it&#39;s from World War two maybe
that&#39;s the significance well now if you
look a little bit further you&#39;ll see
there&#39;s quite a bit more significance
first of all it&#39;s addressed to the
University of Southern California
bookstore okay that&#39;s interesting
during the war but also if you look at
the return address from a place called
rivers Arizona rivers Arizona in a very
odd number for an address 58 1 C by a
young man by the name of Henry Kondo a
little bit of research will show you
that yes Henry Kondo was a Japanese
American from Pasadena attending the
University of Southern California why
would he be writing a letter from rivers
Arizona well that&#39;s because he happened
to be at the Gila River internment camp
block 58 building number one room C he
and his entire family weren&#39;t turd
during World War two because they looked
like the enemy this young man ultimately
joined the 442nd the most awarded US
military unit in all of history filled
with japanese-americans that have been
largely interred due to their ethnicity
because they looked like the enemy he
bravely joined the military himself
fought in in France and gave the
ultimate sacrifice in the famous Battle
of the Lost Texas battalion these are
these significant everyday objects
objects that connect us to people to
places to things they sometimes will
change your view of the world so the
next time you&#39;re looking in your garage
or in your attic grandma&#39;s attic trying
to clear things out take a moment to
look at those tiny little objects
because those tiny little objects can
change your view of the world can change
your view of yourself and of the people
around you thank you
