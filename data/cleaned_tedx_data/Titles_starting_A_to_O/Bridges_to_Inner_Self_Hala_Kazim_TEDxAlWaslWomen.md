when they told me to speak about the the
bridges and my business developer did
the whole slides I said to him leave
everything I&#39;m just going to talk from
my heart which I always do the best and
the most difficult bridge is to build it
within you to build and connect you to
yourself to inner you to your heart your
soul to your brain it&#39;s so easy to bring
cement some steel or whatever it takes
I&#39;m not an architect or engineer to
build a bridge the most difficult is to
bridge and to connect that bridge inside
of you to go back to you the most
difficult question is who are you who
are you I think if you go today and ask
yourself that&#39;s the beginning of
building bridge to yourself so how did I
build my my bridge to holla because I
was a time in my life that I was lost I
was confused I was depressed the
beginning was 22 years back 25 years
back I am 54 do your calculation
and then that was the point and the
moment that I started to build my own
bridge when I suffered and from the
disease which is depression I went
through so much in depression that I
wanted to die and that was the best
point of my life
that&#39;s where brought me to stand today
in front of you guys and speak I had to
think whether to give up to do just the
bridge from here to the other people or
decide to build a very difficult one
they take it from me but I knew that I
don&#39;t deserve to be miserable that&#39;s for
sure so I started my journey and it was
quite a tough one
a very rewarding one but I did went
through therapy went to the psychologist
psychiatrist you can name it until I
found my mentor which is psychotherapist
and she&#39;s the one who helped me to
change my life she&#39;s the one brought
hollaback to me see when we start to
build this bridge inside you have to
understand you have to bring yourself
back we get lost through life through
work family connections with other
people and we think yeah it&#39;s fine I&#39;m
going to do this and when all this we
forget you and you and you we all forget
what we really want how to connect
to ourselves do I connect 24/7 to myself
of course not
but do I connect most of the time yes so
how that happened first of all I knew I
have a problem right
you can&#39;t start building anything I want
for you can&#39;t start building anything
before you admit that you have a problem
right to address it so I knew I have
depression I knew I was miserable I
didn&#39;t know why but I knew I had a
problem
I knocked doors back then of course we
didn&#39;t have this internet and Google
what you&#39;re doing now and it&#39;s not chat
on social media so it had to be
physically to go to someone I did that
the second thing I did what
self-awareness
we think we have self-awareness we don&#39;t
if you work on yourself of course you&#39;re
going to get there slowly slowly but
then you really need to work on yourself
self-awareness why where how my journey
started I did a lot of big change and my
my company&#39;s name is journey through
change the reason I named it is because
I been through this journey I mean
aren&#39;t we all in this journey in
different ways isn&#39;t it amazing even
when we have problems that we are all
everybody in this room has some problems
we all do so you&#39;re not unique we all
are unique we all have problems we all
have but then to realize that you have a
problem - you realize that you know what
you can fix it you can go back to
yourself
what&#39;s your name yes da
and you yes yes yes
Nadine so Dora can go back to herself
Nadine do we have Fatima they have
Miriam do you have Sarah anyone in this
room anyone even in that in the end of
the row if you go back to yourself and
check how can you belt this bridge with
me it was too many too many things I
knew what I want I knew I was depressed
I needed to fix it went through so many
things I don&#39;t want to go on and on but
one of the main thing I went through is
after I changed my life and I got
separated I adopted a sign I had I have
five sons so my three sons then I
adopted then I got married I remarried
again and I have another son so it
didn&#39;t work I had to have sons even
changing your husband didn&#39;t work that&#39;s
my destiny I&#39;m two grandsons so it&#39;s
like I&#39;m around men all the time I have
to say you are very easy creatures
really easy like they need two things
I&#39;m not going to name the second one
food and that&#39;s all man-made
[Laughter]
oh my god the list of the things we made
how complicated are we
that&#39;s why we are detailed people we are
detailed creatures so men are a lousy
cheaters right they don&#39;t look at the
details don&#39;t they
a woman will sit and know what you&#39;re
right here what&#39;s up while you&#39;re in the
end of the room believe me she knows it
all she knows how do you put your phone
where do you put your phone we are I
mean I don&#39;t want to go on and that&#39;s it
not end anyway so we have to get to know
ourselves right we have to address
ourselves and being a woman it&#39;s not
easy where we have a
that&#39;s why we&#39;re mothers I&#39;m sitting
with I&#39;m talking to you here I&#39;m
thinking of lunch today with a family
lunch the kids are coming and they have
to we have which hood everything we
think about it in five seconds anyway so
I did after my second marriage I had
Hassan and hasn&#39;t grew up and then what
is there
how can he build another bridge I&#39;ve
done with one bridge to get me out of
depression and myself and this but then
no there&#39;s must be something more so I
went to community on Tiago in Spain and
did the Camino who knows Camino oh I
love you girl amazing who&#39;s done it
who&#39;s that it pleased you bet it good
for you how many kilometer the last
hundred yeah I&#39;ve done it four times and
I think I&#39;m doing to you do hundred
kilometer in five days and I went there
because for three years I drove my
husband and kids crazy because I could
not connect what what I wanted I didn&#39;t
know what do I want
I tried this and I failed I tried I love
cooking so nothing worked literally I
failed on on until I said you know to my
husband I&#39;m going I need to go with
doing what I didn&#39;t know even what is
hiking I mean for God&#39;s sake I&#39;m an
Emirati in a desert country
what is hiking so I called them my
mentor of like they told me there is
something that they walk and they go to
some she said yes hiking and I&#39;m like
what is it she said well you stay in a
bed-and-breakfast what is better not be
and be I&#39;m like what is B&amp;B like
bed-and-breakfast holla okay fine
so I got to know about it I went I
googled it and I went and I started
walking I didn&#39;t know that that was my
turning point that I really was the
beginning of building the bridge between
me and Hilah and me and others and I
started walking
and rocky of course as I said we don&#39;t
have hiking here so I started walking
and working on you do 25 kilometres a
day and then I thought my you know your
feet kids and because I was ignorant in
this area I will put my my feet in a hot
water
haha like what were you think I didn&#39;t
know I thought it would relieve me no
you should put it in a cold water anyway
I learned all these things and I started
walking and talking and learning about
things that I have never experienced
touching the plants and feeling it and
smelling even near the you know the the
farms and you see the cow just now just
delivered it was like crazy amazing for
me to do and I was started I started
walking with this teacher in America
that she was working with me and started
talking about things I realized it&#39;s the
best therapy to walk and talk then I
started doing another trip I went to
Austria who&#39;s done hiking in Austria
okay that&#39;s great you should go to a
Camino ok Austria I got excited like you
know now now I thought um I have the
experience and I&#39;m good like okay really
so I thought I&#39;m going to go self-guided
okay holla I was back then 47 48 years
old and I thought okay you go and you
will be like everybody else you&#39;ll see
everybody there working you reach there
nobody&#39;s there
nobody and I&#39;m like okay
and it sounds self-guided so you have to
look at the pictures and the direction
and I&#39;m Dyslexic so just imagine I&#39;m
like okay so the best part was that
there was some pictures there anyway
quickly I don&#39;t want to take longer than
I should
I went and I walked and I hiked and I
cried and I laughed all by myself
I used to walk five hours alone in the
forest
and I used to say holla what the hell
you&#39;re doing why could it be the typical
grandmother sitting home and just
enjoying life which is nothing wrong
with it I realize it&#39;s not me I have to
build connections again bridges after
bridges after bridges and that&#39;s what I
did then I went and I took coaching and
counseling in City University in London
and I prepared myself to this amazing
program that I have now journey through
change which it helps women to take care
of themselves so they can take care of
others now when we think of bridges when
we think of inside of us our soul our
heart our mind does it belong to whom
you can talk to everybody 24/7
you can laugh you can mix you can do
anything in the end of the day you have
to connect with whom yourself and if
you&#39;re not happy you cannot make anyone
happy
my basic my talk is today is try to
build a small baby steps to your heart
to you to the human inside of you by the
way one of the amazing things I learned
and a Maya Angelou says we are much more
similar than different we are different
maybe in skin color maybe a nationality
maybe in your religion which is just a
top service but you love and I love you
want a safe country and I want a safe
country you want a good doctor I want a
good doctor
you want healthy children I want healthy
children you get angry I do the same you
enjoy laughing I do the same look at how
similar things we have together so if we
focus on similarity and building bridges
first yourself to believe in what this
is it to believe that we are similar to
believe that you know what it doesn&#39;t
matter what religion you are it doesn&#39;t
matter matter what you know nationality
you are it doesn&#39;t matter what you wear
what matters is how you connect with me
I always say your beliefs your religion
your nationality belongs to you your
manners belongs to me because that&#39;s how
you&#39;re dealing with me if we learn to
connect with ourselves in a healthy way
I promise you you can connect to others
in a healthy way thank you very much
you
