I want you to think about the most
important decision you&#39;ve ever made in
your life
the decision that made you who you are
maybe it was where to go to school or
what to study in school or who to marry
or who not to marry where to live what
is that decision that you made that made
you the person that you are today
now imagine that from the time you were
born you were told you had no choices
you had no options you will not have a
job you will not have friends you will
forever stay in your parents home and
never have your own home that is the
reality forever 4 million Americans with
intellectual disabilities from the time
they are born they are told you don&#39;t
have a choice
you will not have a life so what happens
to him they end up stuck on their
parents couch doing nothing for their
entire lives
no maybe sitting on the couch would be
fun for a day or two but not year after
year after year only 15 percent of
people with intellectual disabilities
have jobs everybody else is on the couch
so let me tell you a little bit about
will will was born with an intellectual
disability and he went to school he went
to elementary school and he was in a
separate segregated class for other
students with disabilities two or three
times a week he was brought down to the
regular education class so that he can
meet some kids and say hi and sing a few
songs that&#39;s pretty much the way his
education progressed the whole time he
was in school
around third grade we sort of got rid of
the academics cuz he had some major
learning challenges but everybody knew
his face and they would high-five him in
the hallway hey man how you doing how
you doing but nobody ever stopped to
listen to see how he was actually doing
they just knew his face knew he had a
disability and wanted him to be happy so
they high-fived in the hallway
actually everyone knew his face so well
that by the time he was a senior he was
voted homecoming king and at the
homecoming football game the news came
out and they did this whole thing about
how this special guy
was so loved that he was homecoming king
but when the game was over he went home
by himself there were no friends coming
over for a party there were no text
messages there was nothing because
nobody really knew him they just knew
that he had a disability and gave him a
good high-five
so when wil graduated from high school
he did what most people with
intellectual disabilities do he went
home and he sat on the couch year after
year after year but then something
happened in 2008 the higher education
Opportunity Act was passed with this act
people with intellectual disabilities
were given the option to go to the place
where everybody else in America goes
after high school to figure out who they
are and what they want to do this act
gives people with intellectual
disabilities the option of going to
college now there&#39;s over 200
post-secondary college programs for
students with intellectual disabilities
when I say intellectual disability I
mean people whose IQs are below 70 they
really struggle in learning academics
they struggle learning those activities
of daily living and they struggle with
social skills so now they have the
opportunity to go to college and receive
an education in all of these areas so
there&#39;s now 200 programs across the
country there&#39;s a clearinghouse called
think College net where people can go
and get information about these programs
but every program is very very different
I&#39;m going to tell you about the one
we&#39;ll went to so there&#39;s four parts to
this education it&#39;s College so obviously
we&#39;re gonna have some academics students
with intellectual disabilities have the
opportunity to go to traditional classes
with traditional college students not
everybody in the room knows they have a
disability but they have the Opera
to learn and they can&#39;t learn at all
because of their disability but maybe
they can learn 20% or 40% but that&#39;s 20
or 40 percent more than they got sitting
on the couch doing nothing and not only
do they have the opportunity to learn
content they have the opportunity to
learn all that other stuff you learn by
going to college how to be responsible
how to have follow-through how to
participate and be responsible for your
own learning in addition to an education
and academic these programs also provide
an education and independent living part
of that definition of intellectual
disability includes really struggling
with learning the activities of daily
living so by having the opportunity to
go to college and live in a dorm and
live independently while receiving an
education students have the opportunity
to learn all of that stuff that
everybody else can just sort of figure
out but because of their disability
these students can&#39;t living in the dorms
they can make mistakes while they have
support to learn from those mistakes and
they can learn how to do laundry and
manage time and how you make it through
a day from start to finish how you get
from here to there how you plan out your
day these are all things that have stood
in the way traditionally for students
with intellectual disabilities to make
it in this world and now they can
receive that education in addition to
that these programs have education in
the area of socialization this one&#39;s
kind of hard to teach because we&#39;ve
really taught people with intellectual
disabilities that they&#39;re exceptional
that they need exceptional and different
treatment but that actually gets in the
way so we want students with
intellectual disabilities to be able to
go to college and be treated like
everyone else when they arrived at
campus on that first day the president
of the university does not need to know
the names of the students that have
disabilities unless the president of the
university knows the name of every
single freshman coming in this school we
want students to be able to join clubs
and Greek life and participate like
everyone else without being high-fived
and treated differently because of that
disability we want a student like we&#39;ll
to be able to join if return
and just enjoy the day with his brothers
and not have newscasters come in and say
look an exceptional student has joined
an exceptional organization we want the
same treatment so that he can learn how
to interact because when he has a job
one day he&#39;s gonna need to know how to
interact with his co-workers when he has
an apartment one day he&#39;s gonna need to
know how to interact with his neighbors
so we want to be able to provide that
socialization education the last area is
Career Development remember I told you
only 15 percent of people with
intellectual disabilities have jobs but
through an education we can actually
take that statistic of 15 percent and
turn it on its head so that 85 percent
of people with intellectual disabilities
have employment we do that by letting
students participate in internships
generally students with intellectual
disabilities have very limited
experiences so they have no idea what
they want to do for a job so they have
the opportunity to be in an internship
each semester during the four years that
they&#39;re in college and try things out
figure out what they like figure out
what they don&#39;t like figure out what
they&#39;re good at what they&#39;re not so good
at so that they&#39;re on a path for real
jobs real employment and that will give
them the opportunity to make those sort
of life-changing decisions that you have
the opportunity to make to make the sort
of decisions that made you who you are
we want students with intellectual
disabilities to be able to make those
sorts of decisions too so that&#39;s what
we&#39;ll did we&#39;ll went to college he
joined a fraternity he has a group of
friends that he is still in contact with
to this day about two years after he
graduated he sent me a picture of a
painting on a wall and I was like nice
painting why are you sending me this and
he said I&#39;m 28 years old and for the
first time in my life I can hang a
picture on a wall where I want it
because it&#39;s my house it&#39;s not my
parents it&#39;s mine so I want to leave you
with two things one please know that
college is possible for students with
intellectual disabilities and it&#39;s
life-changing
let&#39;s get those folks off the couch and
back into society with us where they
belong
and secondly I need your help I need you
to remember
that exceptional treatment does not
equal an exceptional life it equals an
exception from life thank you
