my talk to you is quite personal and if
you will you will touch on some things
in Northern Ireland that you will
recognize but first we&#39;re gonna start
with the word does anybody know what it
is it&#39;s pronounced jefra phobia and it
means a fear of bridges and here&#39;s a
bridge now this bridge is over the
Chesapeake Bay in Maryland in the United
States and when they built it it was so
scary because you can see it&#39;s quite
slender at the sides then a lot of
people were too afraid to cross it so
the locals started calling it the bridge
to hell now you can see look four points
three miles long a hundred and eighty
six feet high you can actually get a
tall ship underneath that see can you
imagine driving over this bridge so what
happened was some people drove across no
problem looking at the fantastic view
watching the boats looking for their
destination others got halfway across
and throws they couldn&#39;t go forwards and
they couldn&#39;t go backwards and then
others couldn&#39;t even get onto the bridge
at all they were too afraid so a
solution had to be find and the solution
was and is until this day because I did
a story on this bridge 20 years ago if
you&#39;re afraid someone will get into your
car at the end of the bridge and drive
your cross now our lives are rather like
bridges aren&#39;t they we go from here to
there opportunities and obstacles this
is my life and we tried to make little
bridges but you get the idea don&#39;t you I
come from Belfast yes I went to London
then from London to Belfast again then
from Belfast I went to Tokyo then from
Tokyo I went to Frankfurt Frankfurt to
Washington DC when I did the story about
the bridge and Washington DC back to
London where I am now I know a career
like that has loads of opportunities but
it also has many obstacles I started my
career at a time
when it was mostly male dominated the
media particularly here in Northern
Ireland so first I went into my
broadcasting newsroom someone looked at
me a male colleague and said hmm I said
oh it&#39;s a girl there&#39;s a great job going
in the library so I thought okay
day two don&#39;t be having any ambition
you&#39;re from Northern Ireland you have a
Northern Ireland accent you&#39;re going
nowhere so it didn&#39;t take the job in the
library and I went everywhere
yeah night.the along the way just like
people were helping others over the
bridge I had some help as well and
strangely it was mostly from women
firstly when I was at school and I
wanted to be a journalist it really
wasn&#39;t a job for a girl in Northern
Ireland all that time again and people
were saying be a teacher be a secretary
no I wanted to be a journalist and the
person who gave me the confidence to do
that was my English teacher she believed
in me therefore I believed in myself and
I wouldn&#39;t be here where I am today if
it hadn&#39;t been for her the other people
who&#39;ve helped me along the way are my
family I couldn&#39;t have done without my
family even if they didn&#39;t see me from
months apart from on TV they were always
there at the end of the phone and they
were always there in full support when I
was travelling around the world I have
my two daughters with me so my mother is
here tonight used to travel with me
sometimes to look after my children if I
was on assignment because you also have
to realize that it wasn&#39;t just me
travelling on this journey I have my two
daughters with me so they were traveling
on these bridges and these challenges in
this journey as well they were changing
schools they were leaving their friends
we were moving countries all those sorts
of things which are very disruptive and
during that period I actually built
myself a bridge of guilt in my head you
know what we&#39;re like if anyone who&#39;s got
children are we doing the like sing will
they be okay
is a school right for them but as they
grew older they actually demolished my
bridge of guilt and they told me that
they wouldn&#39;t have changed our troubles
and adventures for the world
the other things that happened to me
along the way let me just give you an
example from Tokyo for instance I had a
male or a female translator and I would
go to these big meetings that were all
male and it was as if I haven&#39;t walked
into the room I changed the translator
to a man and suddenly I was somebody to
talk to because I had a man working for
me I kid you not this is the very early
90s the other thing that happened to me
throughout my career is I&#39;ve experienced
all the things that a lot of women have
experienced ageism sexism and gender
inequality ageism was the one that hit
me hardest as a woman gets towards 50
particularly in the media we disappeared
both in front of the camera and behind
the camera
a man can age in front of a camera
whereas a woman can&#39;t a wrinkle on a man
will be seen as maturity and experience
a wrinkle on a woman is considered old
so it&#39;s just imagine you&#39;re approaching
a fifties you&#39;re in your early 50s and
you&#39;re dealing with all the aspects of
getting a little bit older anyway
perhaps you&#39;re thinking you might have
the menopause if you&#39;re having the
menopause all of those things that we
have to deal with and then suddenly
you&#39;re being slightly sidelined for
younger models I haven&#39;t got anything
against younger models and we all were
there and we all came through but there
is a time and a place now this got so
bad for me it went on over a period of
two years and it got so bad for me that
I woke up one morning and thought I&#39;m
going to give up my job now bearing in
mind everything I&#39;d done and where I was
and how hard I&#39;d fought for this this
was a huge decision except after I&#39;d had
a cup of tea I suddenly thought I&#39;m
gonna give up my job it&#39;s my job Ponta
on I&#39;m not giving it up then I had to go
through this difficult process of how do
I address this so I did go through the
and it was difficult but I claimed my
place I kept my job
I stayed there wrinkles and all but the
reason that happened as well as there
was support there was a support network
from female colleagues and female
friends and my family obstacles can be
overcome but we&#39;ve got to be strong
enough to do them you&#39;ve got to be
strong enough to drive across that
bridge and if you can&#39;t there&#39;s nothing
wrong with asking for help this is me
and my sisters I grew up actually about
five miles from here so this is on the
left this photograph is with me look at
the lovely curls what happened to them
with my grandfather visiting him in
Hollywood he was very dear to me and
this is me with my two sisters and it&#39;s
actually taking me 60 years to get to
where I am today some of the you&#39;ll get
some nice old photographs here several
of the challenges I grabbed with both
hands you know it&#39;s like great I&#39;m
having that job I&#39;ll do anything to get
that job some of them I sort of thought
so I suppose I was halfway across my
bridge and you know the way we women say
things like Oh could I really do this Oh
will I be good enough will it be okay of
course it&#39;s going to be okay
of course we can do it why shouldn&#39;t we
able to be able to do it so there we go
I&#39;m going around the world and I&#39;m
crossing a lot of bridges at that time
for female journalists as well so I&#39;m
going into jobs and I&#39;m going into areas
that perhaps they wouldn&#39;t have been
there before that&#39;s John Major&#39;s the
back of his head by the way I was very
glad the photographer my face and the
back of his head I was in Washington I
was in Tokyo and I covered some of the
biggest stories in the world but again
right along the way one of the things I
always did I was I always helped other
young journalists male and female but
particularly young female journalists
coming through who perhaps didn&#39;t have
the confidence it&#39;s that sort of help
that I would love to have heard when I
was a young journalist with my first
walked into that news room and was told
to get a job in the library so here we
are I&#39;ve not been a journalist for 40
years so it&#39;s been fairly successful and
I covered everything that I&#39;ve wanted to
do and I am very very pleased to report
it&#39;s no longer male-dominated so we have
a very good gender mix knife what we
don&#39;t have though is a gender equality
and pay equality so we have to still
fight for those things not just in my
industry but in all industries we have
to fight against any form of ageism any
form of sexism and definitely any form
of gender pay inequality I left the BBC
in April this year it was my decision it
was on the 15th of April when I gave my
last broadcast and one of the reasons I
left was because having been a
journalist for 40 years had also been at
the BBC for 20 years I thought it&#39;s time
to do something else it&#39;s time to have
another career because when you think
about it I&#39;ll come back to that one in a
second we&#39;re up against a lot as women
Madeleine Albright the US Secretary of
State former said that when she was
rising up through the ranks to become US
Secretary of State she felt that she had
to be better than an equivalent man so
you could have the same qualifications
but you had to be better and I thought
that right through my career I could be
sitting or standing beside a man with
exactly the same qualifications and
exactly the same experience but I had to
be better and she said the same thing
and what she said was she could be a
mediocre man but you can&#39;t be a mediocre
woman and she was right I&#39;m crossing a
new bridge this year as you can see from
the birthday cake
I was 60 in September and I&#39;ve decided
to start a new career using all of those
skills that I&#39;ve gained in the last four
years as a journalist because you know
what we women are living longer
we are healthier and we are ready for
any challenge that we face is us my
grandmother would have been retired at
sixty I want a whole new career and as
it says on the cake
sixty is really the new 40 so I take you
back to the bridge
you remember from the beginning the
scary bridge because when you cross your
bridge as a woman in particular and
you&#39;re feeling successful and you&#39;re
feeling you can go across your bridge
turn around reach out your hand to the
next woman and if we all do that we&#39;ll
build our own bridge and then we&#39;ll be
invincible thank you very much
[Applause]
you
