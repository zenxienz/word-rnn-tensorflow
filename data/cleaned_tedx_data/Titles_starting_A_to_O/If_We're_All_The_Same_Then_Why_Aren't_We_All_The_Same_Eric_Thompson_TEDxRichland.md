you ever had an experience where you
wanted to take control of your feelings
but no matter how hard you tried your
feelings had control of you you might be
witnessing one of those moments right
now so I&#39;m here today to talk about
feelings about how we all have the same
feelings we all have the same structure
of a feeling how a feeling works how you
have thousands of them per second how
they&#39;re all unique to each individual
and how we all have kind of the same
feelings
we just can&#39;t feel them the same way so
I&#39;m not sure how many of you are mature
enough to remember the y2k scare but the
machines were gonna stop working the
world was going to come to an end it was
going to be total chaos right and in a
slightly lesser degree for me that&#39;s
what happened I was working as an under
a fellowship at Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory and while I was
extremely grateful for that opportunity
I wasn&#39;t having any fun I mean I had the
same tasks every single day you know I
had very little room for creativity I
had very little connection with other
people and I really really wanted to
interface with something that actually
had a face so it was about that time
that I was introduced to alternative
healthcare first as a patient and then
soon thereafter as a practitioner so
let&#39;s jump ahead to 2010 at that point
had been practicing for nearly a decade
and seen thousands of people with
differing responses but the ones that
were most difficult for me to overcome
the ones that were most difficult for me
to help people with were the ones that
were being triggered by emotions your
neuro network consists of more than a
hundred billion neurons or nerve center
signals these neurons process and
transmit information along neuro
pathways and along those neural pathways
you see the activity of
neurotransmitters in neuro pet
these neural peptides all contain the
same amino acids and those amino acids
build the same peptides and they all
have the same structure and function for
every single one of us every single one
of us is exactly organically the same so
that led me to the question again the
foundational question if we&#39;re all the
same why aren&#39;t we all the same I think
that that question takes us to where
does a feeling come from but our a
better question might be what is a
feeling I propose that a feeling is a
signal an electronic a no like energetic
signal that travels up and down your
neural pathways right alongside the
neurotransmitters and neuro peptides and
it&#39;s these signals that create our
feeling at the conscious and the
unconscious levels in order to feel
these things all in their entirety your
brain your conscious brain would have to
process information at a rate of
thousands of bits per second we&#39;re not
able to do that so that&#39;s where stress
anxiety things like stress anxiety and
depression come from there&#39;s this
overwhelming amount of emotions and
feelings that are happening at the
unconscious level so I&#39;ll move forward
and talk a little bit about what a
feeling actually is so I believe a
feeling I believe a feeling is a group
of emotions tied together in an in the
form of an emotional peptide much what
you see up here in fact this is the
emotional peptide that made up my
unconscious response to the thought of
being here today there it is in all its
glory
talk about being emotionally vulnerable
right there it is so here I am and there
it is unfortunately I didn&#39;t plan for
the beginning of this but there it is
rebellious that was my feeling at the
thought of giving this talk today and no
matter how many times I talk about it on
paper it&#39;s going to look a lot like
rejection like a fear of rejection I
didn&#39;t have a fear of rejection what I
had was a fear that you would rebel
against my idea no matter how many times
I tried to clear out the idea of being
rejected it just didn&#39;t fit so these are
the emotions that tie together that make
a feeling for me certainly relaxed is
obviously what I am
sometimes things don&#39;t go the way you
want them to whether you have feelings
or not so so you have thousands and
thousands of these things per second on
the unconscious level in fact I tell
patients that I have about 20 or every
one of us has about 20,000 of these
impulses that travel up and down those
neural pathways every second give you an
idea what that kind of looks like this
one&#39;s at about 20 seconds a single
feeling one feeling in 20 seconds so as
you sit here today every second you have
20,000 ish everybody&#39;s a little bit
different right and so if there&#39;s ipping
by here&#39;s one at six seconds so if every
one of those is an energetic impulse how
in the world do you stop yourself from
feeling how do you regain control if
you&#39;re overwhelmed in fact you want to
know where stress anxiety and depression
comes from it comes from there it&#39;s too
much I want to talk a little bit about
stress anxiety and depression for just a
minute depression is the weight of the
cart you&#39;re pulling anxiety is standing
up here anxiety are the obstacles you
have to overcome while pulling that
weight and stress is where you need to
have that weight and when it&#39;s not the
weight that&#39;s the problem or excuse me
it&#39;s the weight that&#39;s the problem it&#39;s
not stress anxiety and depression and
every single person&#39;s weight is unique
we all have the exact same feelings we
just assemble them differently and
that&#39;s why we can&#39;t talk about it that&#39;s
why we can talk about anger but one
person doesn&#39;t feel it the same way the
other does the feeling is the same but
the way it feels is different
every single one of us is that way so
you want to talk about stress anxiety
and depression
you really have to identify what it is
that&#39;s weighing you down that you have
to overcome the obstacles that that
feeling of having to have right now
that&#39;s where the stuff comes from every
single one of us builds feelings at a
rate faster and greater than any of us
can compute in fact if some of you
remember my y2k response or question
some of you will also remember the
Commodore 64 home computers the five and
a quarter inch floppy disk those were
fun right so I tell everyone that comes
to see me that right here this is your
Commodore 64 home computer and back here
this is the mainframe at CIA
headquarters
this one can&#39;t talk to this one and this
one could care less what this one thinks
that&#39;s sort of how we go through our day
and we try to pick and choose based on
how we feel only we don&#39;t know what we
feel and I&#39;m not even going to talk
about how how just how off we are with
our words if you can&#39;t identify the
right word how can you identify the
right feeling so patients come to see me
with pretty much the same complaint or
the same issue they don&#39;t feel good they
want to feel better and when I asked
them what would you like to feel better
with more often than not they can&#39;t tell
me all they can say is they don&#39;t feel
good
feeling good starts with emotions it
builds feelings feelings turn to beliefs
and beliefs become belief systems what&#39;s
happening in here is not a byproduct of
what&#39;s going on out here
what&#39;s going on out here is a byproduct
of what&#39;s going on in here I never
planned for the clicker to be rebellious
I planned for you people to be
rebellious but not this clicker
so if I can give you a piece of advice
to take away from here a call to action
and I call to action would be this slow
down
don&#39;t try and out think it if something
changes run with it
find your words know your words so that
you can describe what you&#39;re actually
feeling and as soon as you do that as
soon as you hit that little golden mind
you&#39;ll feel better thank you very much
[Applause]
