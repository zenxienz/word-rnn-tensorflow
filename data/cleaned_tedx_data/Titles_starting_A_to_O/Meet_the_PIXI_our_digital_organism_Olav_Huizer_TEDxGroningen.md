what do you see when you look at this
it&#39;s beautiful isn&#39;t it
actually this is one of the many
processes Nature has of intricate
behavior that has this beautiful visual
outcome it would almost make us believe
that there&#39;s some grand design behind it
some thing that&#39;s keeping track of all
the movements and orchestrating the
system as a whole well there&#39;s not this
intricate behavior is all created on the
level of the individual one bird can do
that when he&#39;s got friends
so now you guys might be thinking all
right a guy with a beard talking about
bird behavior he must be a biologist or
a bird fanatic I&#39;m sorry for your bird
lovers out here I&#39;m not a biologist and
I&#39;m also not going to talk about bird
behavior I&#39;m a graphic designer
and what I do is I create light
installations and in these installations
I control every single part I designed
this spectacle from start to finish and
I know exactly what&#39;s going to happen
inside of this installation you might
find something like this one big
computer that&#39;s controlling the whole
system and I&#39;m controlling that computer
I perform with it and what it means is
that while I&#39;m performing performing
there are no surprises to me I know
what&#39;s gonna happen and I can&#39;t be
surprised myself but you know who still
surprises me every time those birds so
yeah I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna leave you guys
on this one so you can count the cables
there a lot so losing the control and
building something new that&#39;s what I
wanted I wanted to something that
surprised me and what I was thinking
can I create this flock of birds can I
can I do what nature does when they make
birds do what they do when they flock
could I create my own individual being
that when put in a group will creates a
new thing with a beautiful visual
outcome could I lose this control and
surprise myself
luckily for me biologists have already
came up with the rules the simple rules
that would mimic this flocking behavior
and looking at these rules I realized
that those rules are actually quite
simple if you look at the rules for one
bird those rules would be small enough
to programming them into a small
microprocessor so here&#39;s what we did
every animal needs a brain a body a
means of communication and a behavior so
for our animal our being we used for
essence brain we used a microprocessor
and sensors for its communication we
used a radio frequency transceiver for
its energy source a battery and for its
body a printed circuit board with a
wooden shell and now the behavior all
animals or pretty much anything here has
a set of rules which govern their lives
so just as as as we we needed to set
some ground rules and the grooves the
the first rules were something like
listen to your neighbor observe your
surroundings if you hear something
respond and if it&#39;s been quiet for a
long time make up a message and then if
there&#39;s nothing around go to sleep they
run on batteries right so we had the
ground rules there now we needed to give
them the power of two choice to choose
and the way we did this is we created
many messages they could pick from and
it could pick from them in every order
or means that they found necessary and
also now they were allowed to ignore
their neighbor or to not speak when they
felt like it they did always have to go
to sleep though
no discussion and then we want one step
forward further because in nature
nothing is alike right all bird all
birds are different we are different
everything&#39;s different we&#39;re all sort of
the same but not exactly the same and we
wanted that too so the first individual
we made we asked him to design his own
shell
we gave him a base shape to work with
and we had him create variations upon
this shell and all those variations
became the housings for all of its
friends to come and now they didn&#39;t need
us anymore
right they would do what they would do
and I couldn&#39;t orchestrate or
choreograph and I think it&#39;s also time
that you guys meet the individual before
we go to the flock here it is the pixie
and now we were at the stage of
multiplying this individual 1,500 of
them we created all different or unique
also uniquely looking and it was also
time to pick its habitat we picked a
forest in the Dutch province of Toronto
and we installed them in the trees and
then it was time to see what they would
how they would behave in nature exactly
two weeks ago we woke them up and here&#39;s
what happened
they talked they made up their own
messages they behaved as individuals but
most of all they they were became part
of their colony to live to live as one
and is some greater than their parts and
finally I was able to sit there and
enjoy something I made not knowing what
was gonna happen and see something new
you know what surprised me the most when
it was hot or cold or when it was rainy
or foggy their behavior changed and that
made me think when seasons change with
their behavior change and if we created
more of them would they split up into
smaller colonies what if how would they
internet interact with human life-forms
what if I create another digital colony
and put it next to it would they become
friends but also it made me think how
would it feel like what what would it
feel like for us if we design our cities
in a similar manner
imagine street lights behaving like
Pixies right imagine they could interact
with you I think all I&#39;m trying to say
is how would our cities feel or wouldn&#39;t
it be nice if our cities would feel more
like a forest
