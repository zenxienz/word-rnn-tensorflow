you
On January 14th 2013 I posted this
discussion topic of the day to my
Facebook page just to see what would
happen
I got a few interesting responses and so
the next day I did the same thing and
the next and every weekday since in the
last almost 5 years I have asked my
Facebook friends nearly 1300 questions
just to see what they would say I
started doing this because frankly I was
sick of watching my friends all of whom
I knew to be incredibly interesting
people having the same 5 conversations
and 3 arguments over and over again
according to my dad I have been asking
questions since about 3 minutes after
conception and I have been thinking
about and studying their form and
functionality seriously for at least the
last four years if there is one thing I
have learned from this project that I
never really intended to be a project at
all it&#39;s that questions are pretty darn
awesome questions are also an incredibly
important part of the conversations we
create of having more respectful
communication between people and more
honest dialogue with ourselves now there
are at least 50 Ted and TEDx talks alone
already encouraging us to ask questions
telling us that we should ask better
questions and even giving us formulas
for great questions nine of those
speeches reference one quote by Albert
Einstein and over half reference
Socrates in the Socratic method this is
not going to be one of those speeches
for one thing I will never argue that
there is such a thing as a good question
or a bad question because frankly I
don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a case I think
that every question no matter how
awkwardly constructed how completely
inappropriate or how totally passive a
civ is still an invitation to
conversation and it is up to the person
asking as much as the person being asked
to actively accept or reject that
invitation now like party invitations
not all questions are created the same
far from it questions are created by
consciousness which can be a very messy
place to hang out even going back for
years I can tell some of the most
stressful times in my life by the kinds
of questions I asked

2:07 how do you prioritize 2:09 what do
you consider a good work-life balance

and 2:16
what does giving up mean to you the form
the structure even the topics of those
questions all reveal a lot about what
was going on in my head at the time and
in thinking about how questions frame
conversation like that I&#39;ve come to the
conclusion that what we need is a
taxonomy of questions a way to
categorize how questions function in
conversation how they impact one another
and how they impact us now there have
been attempts to categorize questions
before Benjamin blooms educational
taxonomy of questions is probably one of
the most familiar especially if you are
a teacher but what this and dozens of
other categorization systems miss is
that it is not about what questions do
for us questions are a living part of
the conversations we create and
therefore they are worth being
understood for what they are and for
what they can be so I would propose a
three category taxonomy of questions
informational rhetorical and exploratory
to define how questions are both asked
and how questions are received the first
category is informational these are the
questions that are asked
some kind of information already
available or that we kind of have
figured out we asked them because the
information would be useful to us or
because we have been as Michael from
Vsauce puts it kicked in the curiosity
these are questions like how many
questions a day does a toddler ask 1200
for the record or 1141 how many miles a
day do you walk or even 688 what is your
go-to small talk topic these are the
questions we deal with day in and day
out we could easily Google the answers
or there&#39;s something that we kind of
have figured out in our head if they do
come up in small talk and I&#39;ll let you
in on a little secret I love small talk
now don&#39;t get me wrong I am absolutely
terrible at it I have this tendency to
be very awkward and I ask these
questions that frankly nobody has a
scripted response for but small talk
serves as that initial conversational
ritual that builds social connection and
builds trust so larger conversations can
be had and more intimate questions can
be asked and how somebody constructs an
informational question and how they
script their response to it can also be
very illustrative about how they view
the world though not nearly as
illustrative as the second category of
questions
rhetorical these are the questions asked
where the person asking generally knows
what kind of an answer they expect to
get these are literally begging the
question they are begging for a
viewpoint to be confirmed they&#39;re
begging for a worldview to be shared or
for an argument to be had when I was
growing up my mom owned a catering
business and reception center and in
helping with the innumerable weddings
over the years I learned that there is
always going to be one
uncle or aunt or very sweet grandmother
who walks up to the couple in the
receiving line and says so when are you
two gonna get started on a family it&#39;s a
kind of conversation nobody wants to
have at their wedding in the receiving
line with their grandmother it also
reveals that said relative asking
doesn&#39;t really believe that getting
married is in and of itself starting a
family
however weddings are also the home to a
very different set of rhetorical
questions with a very different set of
assumptions behind them namely do you
take this person to be your lawfully
wedded spouse if you don&#39;t know what the
answer to that question is well you
might want to examine how exactly you
have arrived at that moment in your life
how you&#39;ve arrived at that moment at
least in many good relationships often
begins with a whole lot of the third
category of questions
exploratory these are the questions that
open the door and invite in conversation
they may or may not be open-ended
questions but they are the questions
that hacked as the kickoff or the pit
stop of an intellectual adventure these
are the questions of memory of feeling
and of opinion these are the questions
that we often shy away from asking
though I think we would all benefit from
engaging with just a little bit more
these are questions like 18 when is a
habit worth breaking to 26 what has been
your most transformative life experience

so far or even 5:52 if you were to give
a TED style talk what would it be about
I think I was about two years early on
that one
now it&#39;s important to note that this
taxonomy like all categorization systems
isn&#39;t perfect things don&#39;t always neatly
fit into one category or another and
between how a question is asked and
received between how a question is
constructed and interpreted many
questions end up more more like this guy
and like our egg-laying duck-billed
mammal friend the platypus reminds us
mixing things up a little isn&#39;t always
such a bad thing the scientific method
begins with exploratory questions and
then narrows things down into
informational questions that can be
tested one of my personal favorite
pastimes is responding to rhetorical
questions with honest informational
inquiries so tell me grandma how do you
get started on a family
in fact because questions serve as the
antithesis to assumption is it my belief
that asking a question is one of the
most respectful acts that you can engage
in one study found that by the age of
fourteen we asked half as many questions
as we did when we were just four years
old you can spend an entire lifetime
studying the question why but the fact
is it happens and when we are faced with
a lack of information that comes at
least partially from not asking
questions then we have this tendency to
fill in our own thoughts and ideas our
own experiences and morals our own
framework and answers but when we are
willing to swallow our pride look just a
little bit silly and ask a question then
we are creating a shared framework for
communication we are opening ourselves
up to possibility questions allow a
weakness no matter how small in the
armor of our assumptions to show and I
consider that to be an extraordinarily
respectful act this is a point that was
driven home to me when I asked this
question 198 do you give blood why or
why not
now this could be taken as an
informational question do you give what
as a rhetorical question do you give
blood oh why not or even as an
exploratory question asking for people&#39;s
experiences of blood donation this was
the most commented on question in the
first 500 that I asked and answer people
did some said they felt it was their
moral duty to give blood others said
that they were afraid of needles would
pass out and there was no way that was
ever happening and then one person
jumped in and said that while he
he desperately wanted to give blood he
couldn&#39;t because of the ban on sexually
active gay men doing so several people
responded with surprise they had no idea
that such a ban was in place and from
what I&#39;ve been told that conversation
moved from the public realm into the
private realm where everybody involved
learned a little bit something new and
that&#39;s the thing about the space that
questions create it can only be useful
if everybody involved is willing to
actually hold and utilize that space for
the opportunity it creates if somebody
asks you a question then you can only
take responsibility for how you
interpret and respond to that question
if you are asking somebody else a
question then you can only take
responsibility for how you construct and
ask the question it is a two-way street
that relies on taking personal
responsibility on a small amount of
trust and I&#39;m being willing to look like
maybe just just maybe you don&#39;t know
everything
authoritarian conversation personally or
politically relies on people being okay
with questions not being honestly asked
and answered
democratic conversation personally or
politically relies on participation it
is your job to show up to decide to
participate and to respect the time and
energy it takes for others to do the
exact same this is why I think there is
not really such a thing as a bad
question because even a bad question can
open up the door for conversation if
everybody involved is willing to treat
it like an actual question and not like
some kind of statement of fact you know
there&#39;s even this linguistic quirk
called up top or high rising terminal
that allows you to turn any
went into a question simply by lifting
your tone at the end it&#39;s my argument
that lifting your tone asking a question
opening yourself up has a subconscious
impact it opens us to that conversation
it opens us to other people yeah that is
an incredibly vulnerable place to be in
but that is what makes it so incredibly
powerful human beings are at our
absolute best when we are learning when
we are open to conversation when we are
open to intellectual adventure after all
a question is not some kind of personal
attack a question as a gift it is the
gift of intellectual advance it is the
gift of connection it is the gift of
communication it is the gift of our very
humanity in letters to a young poet it
was written I beg of you as well as I
can to try and love the questions
themselves and so today I ask you what
is your relationship to questions thank
you
you
