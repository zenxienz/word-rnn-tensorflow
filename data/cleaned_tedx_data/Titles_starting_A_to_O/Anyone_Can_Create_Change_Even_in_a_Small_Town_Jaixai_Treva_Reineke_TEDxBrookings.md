hello I&#39;m jazz I do you or did you ever
feel like in a small town there wasn&#39;t
much change or possibility that could
happen it just seemed like a boring town
of 20,000 people for many people here
welcome to Brookings South Dakota you
may view this town as I just described
but wait change doesn&#39;t have to be
extreme it doesn&#39;t have to be an
invention or make you famous it just has
to be an idea Brookings and many towns
like Brookings are small less known
towns that are full of innovative
possibility I moved here as a fifth
grader in 2015 it came from Detroit
Michigan so my parents would always
drive me downtown and show me the old
crumbling train stations opera houses
and office buildings many people would
think of it as just trash does the pile
of junk on the road that should be
replaced by a new building it was the
same with what I called Detroit letters
also known as graffiti but no it wasn&#39;t
just the bits and pieces leftover from a
building the letters weren&#39;t paint on
the wall to me they were both arts they
brought character and meaning to the
town something most days today seem to
lack or lose in my mind the other
buildings were the junk on the side of
the road they didn&#39;t bring the same
meaning as the historic dilapidated
buildings artists saw blank walls they
took one look and called it a canvas
most people look right through this now
being used to the city when I&#39;m when I
was moving to South Dakota I didn&#39;t know
what to think I started having dreams
and my friends and I wearing my little
house on the prairie dress and bonnet I
didn&#39;t understand why everyone was
looking at me strange I did however see
plain fields of corn and soy so bland so
brown so full a possum
loyalty and just like a Detroit artist I
told myself to make it my canvas it was
my turn in my opportunity I was gonna
change the world with corn soy and a
packet of unclassified wildflower seeds
that I got from TEDx Brookings when I
was young I used to watch TED Talks of
my dad all the time I didn&#39;t realize how
many lives the events impact or changed
because of simple yet creative ideas I
was inspired when I learned that
Brookings had a TEDx event TEDx
Brookings was the first TEDx event I had
ever been to that was a year ago yeah I
wouldn&#39;t be here today if it weren&#39;t for
TEDx I lived in a big city for eight or
so years and not once was I given the
opportunity to go to TEDx events I had
to move to a small town for such an
opportunity now it took some time to
think about what picture to paint or a
problem to solve but eventually it came
to me
if Brookings had a TEDx event why
couldn&#39;t I and in May of last year I did
just that I hosted the first ever youth
organized TEDx youth event in South
Dakota ten expire near Park kids
I was thrilled with many individuals and
local businesses supported the events
the event was a huge success
we couldn&#39;t have live speakers because
it was the first event but we could have
live performance breaks in between short
talks by young leaders from around the
world our first performance was a Native
American hoop dancer from Bushnell South
Dakota another was the youngest person
to win the title of world champion yo-yo
master he won the competition at age 11
we also had many fun activities like
soap fealty and creating electric
circuits because we are on a farm
everyone had a chance to interact with
the different farm animals during the
event all of the attendees planted the
unclassified wild flower seeds in a
small garden the garden was also
youngbeom to add character to it and
make it its own the flowers represented
the blooming and blossoming of new ideas
and only a few months later this is what
it looked like
I want people my age to know that is
never too early to start changing the
world it may be hard for her kids to
relate to other accomplished adults but
they may be inspired by other kids who
are going through the same learning
process as them because of my event I
believe my friends are more aware of
things that they can do to change the
world to following my event evidence
that I had changed brookings started to
appear for instance the fiberwerx guild
downtown brookings started having
yarn-bombing events so just remember
this if change isn&#39;t worthwhile or isn&#39;t
possible in a small town then why am i
standing right here today and how was
TEDx working as the first TEDx event I
had ever been to because the organizers
of this event took the time to change a
small part of my life and yours thank
you
you
