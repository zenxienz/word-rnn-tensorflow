there is a bridge we are all familiar
with in fact many of us have crossed
this bridge it&#39;s a beautiful bridge it&#39;s
bright and well lit it&#39;s paved and
smooth and everyone you know has crossed
this bridge or they&#39;ll soon be crossing
it after you and it&#39;s a great experience
crossing this bridge you have parties in
your honor
gifts there&#39;s people there to help you
plan every step of the way and if
anything there&#39;s an overwhelming amount
of support and choices but the best part
about this bridge is where its leading
you - its leading you to the lands of
the perfect life the land of the perfect
life feels safe and secure it&#39;s the
place where you have a partner by your
side and with that maybe the ability to
buy a home have children pets and a
whole new level of tax benefits in the
land of the perfect life you&#39;re married
but many of us know the reality does not
necessarily match this perception of
perfection in our minds and for some it
looks nothing like it there may be daily
fighting tears a constant tension in the
house and most of all a sense of loss of
yourself a little bit more every day
the factoids we&#39;ve all heard stands true
in research nearly 50% of all marriages
and and dissolution so where does the
50% go when they no longer fit in the
land of the perfect life and they need
to leave well they&#39;re not so lucky
because there&#39;s another bridge that you
need to cross an exodus of the perfect
life and it looks nothing like the
bridge that you cross to get in this
bridge is old and rickety no guardrails
to hold on to an only big enough read
across it alone far worse is what you&#39;re
looking at on the other side you picture
a land that&#39;s dried-up
desolate isolated and just overall
depressing and when you think about the
people that live in that land you wonder
why are the
there what happens what&#39;s wrong with
them but perceptions aside in your own
minds you have broken your family and
you are a failure back in 2014 I was
living in the land of the perfect life I
was married a newly-minted suburbanite I
have a three-year-old beautiful
three-year-old daughter living in a home
we had spent nearly a year renovating it
was everything I had wanted on the
outside but on the inside my marriage
was crumbling
we kept reaching for milestones where we
felt things had to and needed to get
better and they didn&#39;t around this time
I had started seeing a therapist and
then we were in her office one day and I
have a memory one of those memories
where you can picture all of the details
around it where we were sitting what she
was wearing in the look on her face when
she said have you considered getting a
divorce
and I remember thinking how could she
say that I would never do that to my
family I could never do that to my
daughter
what would work think what would the
neighbors think but as time went on and
as we slowly checked off every
traditional method of trying to save our
marriage they finally got to the point
where I knew there were no more
milestones that we could set and where
everything would be okay we were going
to have to face the inevitable and cross
that bridge and head to a land that
neither of us wanted anything to do with
and I felt scared and ashamed but my
journey took a few turns that I did not
anticipate and it led me to a land that
actually looks nothing like that
dried-up sad place that I had envisioned
in my mind&#39;s the first curve in the road
I traced back to a day right around when
all of this was happening
and I was walking through the airport
quickly it when I was on a work trip and
as I was walking past the Hudson News
something caught my eye and I stopped
and I walked up and picked up the cover
of an the cover of the Us Weekly
magazine and on the cover was Gwyneth
Paltrow and Chris Martin with a big
tear down the middle and I remember
thinking Oh
Glenna this&#39; going through this - like
we are gonna go through this together
and bigger yet well how are they have to
leave the land of the perfect life and
how are they doing it and while this
cover and this story basically made fun
of them for coining a new cheesy term
for divorce I was fascinated and so then
I dove into the GUP website with a
vengeance
I read about their desire to keep their
family as a unit while they themselves
would no longer be a couple and before
this all I knew of was of divorce was
that you each get a lawyer you start
duking it out and everything is
miserable and terrible for the rest of
your life
that article served as a guidepost for
us to navigate through our own
experience in a more positive way and it
really fundamentally changed the way
that we approached our situation
the second area came around figuring out
where to live and figuring it out fast
our house sold the day it went on the
market and the buyers wanted an early
close and I was like where am I gonna
live so I started looking through places
and it really sent me to an all-time low
the places that were in my single mom
price range was pretty gut-wrenching to
see after putting all the blood sweat
and tears into the renovation of our
home and I had moved into our home
feeling that was the place that my
daughter was going to grow up in on the
day I was signing a lease for an
apartment that I didn&#39;t even like a
community email came in to my inbox and
as I searched through there was a house
in it that needed renters it was
beautiful newly renovated much too big
for my daughter and I but an idea struck
I approached a friend of mine who was
also recently divorced with a
three-year-old daughter and I said
something like look at this amazing
house could you imagine living here and
I mean this could be ridiculous but what
if we live there together I mean who
would do that
but as we talked through it the idea
became less and less ridiculous to us
and we decide
well hey what if we try this for a year
and that was three years ago and the
last three years have been the most
rewarding fun and meaningful years of my
life but I wanted to understand how and
why it was so different from that land I
had pictured in my mind and I knew it
was more than just having a great living
situation and being able to co-parent
successfully it was something that I
felt differently about so after some
soul-searching I figured out that the
reason that it was so different is
because I no longer equated the end of
my marriage with failure I had somewhere
along the line made an unconscious
decision to flip what I thought was a
failure into an opportunity to create
another perfect life but I wanted to
know more because all I saw around me
were women and couples that were
struggling with that failure and that
shame so I started doing research and
I&#39;ve spent the last three years reading
talking to women in the community and
across the country
and I found that there is a common theme
that women who have been able to
navigate through in a more positive and
solutions orient my oriented mindset
share and the common theme is this you
focus on the things that you can control
and you let go of the things that you
can&#39;t you are the one who is in charge
of defining your experience but how
would you begin to define an experience
that you want nothing to do with and you
know nothing about where do you even
start well these days when you&#39;re not
sure how to do something and you need
some answers
what do you turn to Google you got it
but in some cases and especially with
this case it&#39;s not as easy as typing in
a couple search terms and finding some
clarity on the other ends in many areas
of our lives we turn to role models and
mentors we do this in sports and our
jobs and careers in school so why not in
divorce
the first thing that you need to do is
figure out what is important to you and
then you can find someone who shares
some of those same values and you your
experience is very unique and you may
think I don&#39;t think I know anyone who
has gone through a divorce that looks
like they share any of my same values
but sometimes when you start looking and
listening for things and talking you
find you have more in common with people
that are out there and even if you can&#39;t
find one person you sometimes are able
to look at a lot of different situations
and whether you know them personally or
you see them virtually and you take a
little bit of good from everyone&#39;s
situation and you mold it together and
you define an experience of what looks
like success for you it might be looking
at a woman who was not working and she
went back to school and is now has a job
and his earning significant income or
maybe it&#39;s a woman that was left high
and dry but she puts a smile on her face
and is able to co-parent successfully
you figure out what you value you find
someone who shares those same values and
emulate them and maybe one day you can
become a mentor for someone else the
next area is around opening our minds to
the trends and changes that are
happening in the world around us there
are so many things in our lives that are
changing so fast that it blows our minds
some things are so different than they
were 10 years ago or two years ago even
two months ago but divorce is definitely
not one of those things the stigma
around what divorce is like and how
terrible it is is almost ingrained into
our brains
this stigma is a primary contributor to
that failure mindset the world and how
we live in it is changing fast and women
have more education opportunity and
information at our fingertips we can tap
into this technology and the trends to
help us build resources simplify our
lives and connect to others like us how
can divorce get with the times
well one example is looking at how and
where we live and while I fell into the
opportunity to live with a friend and
rent a home koulev Inge is actually
becoming as a rising trend in the United
States and across the world
in some countries like Japan it&#39;s an
established way to live for some singles
startups are jumping on this notion that
they can create better living through
convenience and community and our
building communal homes traditional
housing is built on the antiquated
notion of individuality and the suburban
American Dream but what if we look at
housing that is designed around the
notion and our fundamental needs for
community and social interaction the
communal homes can help with splitting
expenses maintaining a lifestyle and
providing that community all three
things are so important when we are
going through tough times in our lives
another example of getting with the
times is that we are living in what they
call the gig economy side hustles are
becoming the new norm with bringing
opportunity for additional income at our
fingertips driving blogging renting
things out selling things on Etsy there
are all ways that you can shape things
around your lifestyle and things you
enjoy doing and that you&#39;re good at
these are just two examples of some
things that are available to us now that
weren&#39;t available to us 20 years ago
being able to just simply know that they
exist can help us shape a different
definition of how we approach our next
chapter the third area is around
rebuilding our community and what I mean
by community is simply your friend
circle and the people that you surround
yourself with because rest assured this
will get shaken up if you go through a
divorce and it&#39;s something you just have
to be prepared for I remember a time
shortly after our divorce when I sent a
text message to a group of moms to have
a play dates and no one responded but I
didn&#39;t think anything of it
and a few days later I sent another text
and again no response and I had this
silly aha moment where I thought my
phone has being so slow and wonky I need
to restart it and sure enough when I
turned my phone back on the text
messages did not come flooding in as I
was expecting them to and I felt really
sorry for myself and I&#39;ve spent a couple
days shutting some tears and I decided
that it was high time to change my own
narrative and it was time to reshape my
circle I was going to focus on the
relationships that I felt good about and
not focus on the ones that made me feel
bad or brought in negativity and I had
reconnect with friends I had lost touch
with and then I was going to dig deep
and make some new friends
and I like to I like anit to the
Wardrobe refresh of the early 2000s to
2017 because you may need to go in there
and dig through that closet and pull out
all those pairs of Express work pants
that were the foundation of your
wardrobe but you need to hold on to that
one pair of pants from theory that fits
you really well and then slowly and
deliberately you add back in new pieces
pieces of high quality that fit you well
and make you feel confident in who you
are reshaping your community is a really
cool area because you have some control
here you&#39;re the one in charge and you&#39;re
in the driver&#39;s seat of who you surround
yourself with but it&#39;s not a passive
area it might take you talking to more
people than you normally would and being
a little bit vulnerable asking the moms
at school for coffee or trying to host a
party and then praying that people show
up but it can be a fundamental change in
how you live your life and how you feel
simon Sinek has said before we can build
the world we want to live in we have to
imagine it so now I want you to imagine
it imagine this there is no bridge that
the 50% has to cross to leave the land
of the
perfect life rather we stay in the land
of the perfect life and we redefine how
we live in it we do this by following
positive role models tapping into the
trends and technology around us to help
us maintain a quality of life and
reshaping the neighbors who surround us
to provide more supports and meaning in
our lives I believe that when you change
your perception you can change your
experience and this is one experience
that is ready for a change
thank you
