let me first ask you a question to begin
did you keep a diary as a child who did
no just kidding I&#39;m not gonna count I
did I remember being 10 years old and
I&#39;m lying on my bed on my belly and I&#39;m
dreaming and writing about all the
emotions and feelings that I had and I
wanted to be Romy Schneider the iconic
actress of the sissy movies from the
1950s he cannot imagine how much I
fantasized playing a lead role with her
years later I went back and read that
diary and I made a discovery in one
chapter I imagined a way for me to meet
Romy Schneider I was interviewing her
and writing her story that chapter is
one of my favorites
because in it I envisioned for myself a
career of my own having an article and a
byline in a big magazine and I&#39;m telling
the story of a woman I adored in
hindsight my journalism career started
right there because almost 40 years
later I interviewed scores of women I
started a magazine I appeared on
television and I wrote a novel about
women
that comes from somewhere my passion for
writing and telling stories because even
though I was proud of myself telling
stories I was like okay how serious can
this be how significant is it what
you&#39;re doing
you see when growing up we didn&#39;t have a
color TV and instead of watching kids
shows my mother used to tell stories to
me and my sisters most of the times
stories about women she knew women who
had given birth on their own all by
themselves women who had remained behind
during the war and women who went to
college over the objections of their
family my sisters and me hung on every
word she said storytelling is not
unimportant stories are the rock
foundation of our lives
you only came here because you wanted to
hear stories am i right Emily Esfahani
Smith the author of the book the power
of meaning explains this really well in
her TED talk she says telling our own
stories is one of the pillars of a
meaningful life and I believe that this
is very significant for women to
understand because stories are also the
roadmap to what&#39;s possible if women get
written out of the stories and let&#39;s
face it we have been for centuries then
every woman feels like she&#39;s the first
she&#39;s the outlier and that she has to
fight hard to be seen or to be heard and
don&#39;t forget the word story comes from
history directly from history if we&#39;re
not telling our stories we&#39;ll never make
it to history and this is also what I
found going on in the wine business
about four years ago when I was working
and living in Austin Texas I promised my
Texan girl
friends that I would prepare a delicious
Mediterranean meal with some delightful
Turkish wines little did I know that I
could not get any Turkish wines in
Austin I could get them and use them but
that was like a four hour drive so this
fact that I couldn&#39;t get them really
intrigued me and I wanted to have my
wines so I drove into it and I traveled
and I visited wineries and I hated
myself and I met all these fabulous wine
makers including some amazing female
winemakers and that made me wonder like
how come I don&#39;t know anything about
female while making I consider myself a
well-read person I read the books I read
the magazines I read the papers I even
write for them how come I know so little
about female winemaking
well I can tell you this there were very
few female sommeliers wine masters and
wine professionals put inside it&#39;s a
very total male-dominated industry and
that has been until the late 1970s there
were virtually no female winemaking are
you kidding me
of course they were but they helped
their husbands their brothers and their
fathers they were not documented as the
winemaker that&#39;s not the story anymore
today women graduate from enology
schools the wine study school at the
same rate as men and out of 369 masters
of wine there are 124 female masters of
why master of wine is the highest degree
that you can get in the wine field so
those are the nice facts Oh
my most favorite fact is one study shows
that
even though women make less than 10% of
the workforce they produce more than 28%
of the most honored wines which makes it
that we can easily say when women make
wine they make better wine
really but that&#39;s when they make them
and when they get the opportunity to
make them but of course like in any
other field in the wine industry rare
men also encountered subtle and
not-so-subtle sexism if a man and a
woman pour wine at an event to get as a
wine make who do you think it&#39;s a
success
technical questions and would you
believe me if I told you the story of a
French wine maker it just happened this
decade that she was refused to buy a
tractor on the grounds of her sex only
when her father accompanied her she
could buy the tractor of course from
another supplier but she had a tractor
these are symptoms of an industry that
has not embraced the role women play in
its story next to the wine marketing
agency that I started I decided to
dedicate myself to change the wine story
my next storytelling project is gonna be
a documentary about women in wine who
are truly Trey blazing the trail and in
the same spirit atma as my mother used
to tell I&#39;m gonna leave you with stories
of some amazing women first Natsuki by
Ella after high school she was offered
to study in ology at the stella most
university in south africa until then
she had never tasted wine before she
even had to throw up the first glass she
became the first black female winemaker
and in 2009 she was South Africa&#39;s woman
winemaker of the year and this year she
launched her own
alena wines named after her grandmother
who always supported her then Lauren
Mori Lauren quit her law job in New York
to follow her passion start writing for
a food and wine startup she now
contributes to the wine pages of USA
Today
Forbes magazine and wine enthusiasts
she&#39;s also gonna be a master of wine
next year and I have a special
connection with Lauren Mori because I
interviewed her a couple years ago after
she won the award for best blogger of
the year and her blog was about Turkish
wines and then Yana right mom I love
this woman
Yana has been in ologies for 20 years
and she thinks it&#39;s a sin that the wine
industry is dominated by men and her
recently published wine guide she firmly
states the average woman has a better
palate a better nose and a better tongue
than a man therefore women are better in
judging a wine and of course I totally
agree yes every bottle of wine has a
story to tell and I am excited to start
telling how women&#39;s visions in enology
in wine culture are going to shape the
future of wine making but you can also
make a statement and join me you can
contribute to the rise of female wine
majors by next time when you are about
to order a case of wine or even a bottle
of wine or even a glass of wine that you
consider it&#39;s a bottle of wine made by a
woman Cheers
