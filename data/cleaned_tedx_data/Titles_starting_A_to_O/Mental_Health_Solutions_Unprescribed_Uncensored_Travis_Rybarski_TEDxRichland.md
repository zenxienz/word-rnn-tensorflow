but I know this will never be ended we
got a family addicted of vengeance and
they&#39;ll be offended say I presented lies
about every person that I mentioned we
don&#39;t know the truth best to forget it
none of the blame and none in the credit
nobody&#39;s on the same page it&#39;s all the
same game I&#39;d rather the story be
spreaded we know where we are know where
we&#39;ve been know that it&#39;s never helpful
overthinking for every scar I got a win
I know that for every struggle there&#39;s a
reason don&#39;t need to attack them just
give me my time you tell me to reflect
and look into my mind forgive and forget
that&#39;s a fine line I don&#39;t gotta look
back I know you got mine I&#39;m sorry for
every time I hurt you want a road were
you with the only person to walk it with
me when the ground underneath all
shifted but you maintain the same aim
with the odds against you I love you
every sacrifice that you made to ensure
that I had the life you wished for in a
world where you had despite to get more
acceptance from either side and what for
you to call it the fire from both sides
so nice well hurtin you more so you
shine like gold in the family of blind
soldiers you were nurse in a war zone
thank you for the patience you lead me
with to get through when the hatred is
real I can never thank you enough but I
hope as a start to describe the way that
I feel
TEDx Richland how are you feeling today
thank you
that was a verse off my album the upside
ap dedicated to my brother Raleigh who
you were all blessed to be sharing an
audience with today my hip-hop journey
however did not start with music my
journey through hip-hop started with a
sport called battle rap now rap battles
look a lot different today than they did
in the 8-mile era if that&#39;s what you&#39;re
familiar with today rap battles are
actually acapella rather than on a beat
and we mostly write them ahead of time
rather than freestyling on the spot so
today&#39;s rap battles look kind of like
really degrading spoken word poetry and
there&#39;s a lot of negativity associated
with the battle rap scene and not just
because the premise is that we&#39;re
hurting each other for the entertainment
of others but also because there&#39;s
constant references to violence and
substance use and gang affiliation
around the culture of battle rap we
don&#39;t host them in the safest places in
the world either so I was a 19 year old
when I got involved with rap battles I
had also been involved in a few systems
including the mental health treatment
system the substance abuse treatment
system juvenile justice CPS some
financial resources like DSHS I hadn&#39;t
100% stayed out of trouble as a kid and
it easily could have looked at the time
like battle rap was a creative way for
me to find some
trouble to get into it turned out to be
the opposite what I found underneath
that then- layer around battle rap was a
global underground culture of love and
acceptance the skills that we had to
develop to get on stage and say anything
we want to each other including personal
information like me and my friend Curtis
here did and then get off stage
afterwards and be cool were incredible
and I built a lot of career skills
through battle rap meeting deadlines
networking public speaking creative
writing an overlooked skill not taking
ourselves too seriously I also had to
throw rap battle events so that I had a
place to do rap battles decided to
donate all the money to the local teen
shelter here in tri-cities Washington my
friend&#39;s place after handing thousands
of dollars over to my friends place our
local paper Tri City Herald did a story
about that work and that article ended
up landing me a job offer at a local
behavioral health agency called Lutheran
Community Services I was disappointed
when I realized they weren&#39;t offering me
a job as a battle rapper at the
Behavioral Health Agency but it was a
role even more unique than that it
turned out that my experience in systems
and having my challenges as a young
person and also using hip-hop for my own
recovery had qualified me for a role
called youth peer support an hour
technical term is certified peer
counselor that&#39;s our accreditation I
think youth peer support is a good
description of what we do for the next
eight or nine months my job was to
partner with youth who are in systems
now and support them in navigating those
systems could I personally been there
and during really challenging times to
rely on our relationship and inspire
hope in them through my own story now
all of this work that I&#39;ve done in the
behavioral health field falls under an
umbrella called the system of care and
the term system of care just describes
our statewide network of behavioral
health services we&#39;re using this new
language to explain our system using
that new terminology intentionally to
acknowledge that we&#39;re trying to do
business differently in order to better
meet the needs of youth in our community
my job as a representative of this
system of care is my perspective I bring
my perspective to the table having been
personally impacted by systems the
interesting thing about my perspective
though is that I work in systems now but
personally I actually got a lot more out
of battle rap then I got out of any of
the
systems I was involved in and that&#39;s not
because systems were wrong or bad I had
decent experiences in them it was just
because battle rap connected with me on
a level that systems were never able to
the good news though is there&#39;s a reason
for that battle rap impacted my life so
much because battle rap automatically
honors all three system of care values
without even trying and these three
system of care values guide all of the
work that we&#39;re doing to reform systems
to better meet the needs of youth now
I&#39;ll share with you what those values
are culturally relevant youth driven and
community-based of course battle rap
doesn&#39;t have to try to be these things
if it wasn&#39;t relevant to my culture and
based in my community and driven by me I
wouldn&#39;t have chosen to do it I have no
idea how I made the decision to become
about or effort by the way systems on
the other hand have to intentionally be
these things we know that we&#39;re still
working to be culturally relevant when
youth of color are significantly less
likely to get services despite not being
any less likely to need services we also
know this because we offer one mental
health system statewide to youth from
zero to 21 years of age but only 4% of
people accessing those services or in
that 18 to 21 range and I promise that&#39;s
not because we don&#39;t need support during
that period of our life as Fez we&#39;re
still working to make services relevant
to the cultures of people in that age
range I know firsthand that the fact
that I have a behavioral health
challenge that impacts my quality of
life can create the inherent assumption
that I&#39;m also not well enough to know
what I need and we&#39;re still working
through that challenge in order to allow
youth to drive their services that term
behavioral health that I&#39;m using
includes mental health treatment
substance use treatment even systems
like juvenile justice which are a
response to the behaviors that we show
in public and the point to being
community based is that we want to
minimize the instances in which youth
get out of placement treatment or out of
placement housing we want to keep them
in their homes and communities for their
mental health treatment to learn the
skills where they&#39;re going to use those
skills and of course we want to reduce
the instances of incarceration now the
larger piece of this system of care
puzzle that I have the opportunity to be
a part of is my employer youth sound
Youth sound is a statewide youth
empowerment organization
and part of my mission as a youth town
representative is to ensure that youth
can lead the systems that affect them
that&#39;s a good way for us to achieve
cultural relevance one of my favorite
ways to ensure that youth have a voice
in systems is to engage youth in their
community through workshops now I&#39;m sure
that we&#39;re all familiar with the concept
of a support group we&#39;re partnered with
people who have had a similar challenge
or diagnosis or addiction and we
normalize each other&#39;s challenges we get
to see that other people have been there
we provide hope and connection and
resources with each other support groups
are an incredible thing that saved lives
every day and for some people they
aren&#39;t the answer it&#39;s just because
we&#39;ve been addicted to the same thing or
gotten the same diagnosis or had a
similar trauma doesn&#39;t mean that you and
I have enough in common as people that
we use the same tools to feel better
that&#39;s where workshops come in my first
experience hosting a workshop with youth
sound was soon after taking the position
last year I partnered with a local
stand-up comedian in Olympia Washington
and we advertised in the community that
any youth who had had system involvement
could come do this thing for free we
were loose about how we defined that we
didn&#39;t quiz them about what their
involvement was and it was a great
experience after the two months we even
did a big show together in public which
you can see in the photos and one of the
great opportunities that I had
facilitating this workshop was to
witness the growth and the blossoming of
an individual name&#39;s Nicole Ashe Bailey
Nicole had always wanted to be a
stand-up comedian and this workshop was
her first experience doing so publicly
already only six or eight months later
she&#39;s doing stand-up comedy five six
days a week getting paid for a lot of
her gigs and in the interest of ensuring
that youth can lead the systems that
affect them we connected Nicole with
some people through our workshop that
gave her the opportunity to choose to
become a youth partner as well so she&#39;s
now in a role similar to mine at a
behavioral health agency in Olympia
Nicole was also kind enough to provide
us with a quote about what the workshop
meant to her personal recovery my mental
illness has been treated with therapy
hospitals and medicine but even with
treatment it&#39;s hard to tell where I am
and where the illness is comedy gave me
a small place to see myself now seeing
this change happen in Nicole&#39;s life was
the most important realest
that I&#39;ve made in this journey so far
because what I noticed was that stand-up
comedy did the same thing for Nicole
that battle rap did for me they gave us
an identity and a community to have that
identity in most importantly they
categorized us with other people who
were good at the same stuff and
interested in the same stuff when we
were so used to being categorized with
people who were having the same
challenges and hitting the same barriers
the beautiful thing about this is that
we&#39;re reaching the same youth that other
systems and services are reaching the
only difference is that we were reached
through the strengths that connected to
us us to our community rather than being
reached through the challenges that
caught our community&#39;s attention look
how happy and adorable we are so as a
youths town representative I want to do
more of this I want to do more of what&#39;s
working we hosted that workshop in
Olympia which you can see on the map we
also hosted poetry workshops there we
supported a local nonprofit called the
bridge in hosting a hip hop workshop and
the first Youth sound visual art
workshop started in the tri-cities
Washington this week you&#39;re not allowed
to applaud during these but I know you
would applaud there if you were allowed
to youth sound has other connections
around Washington and regional
affiliates and I hope that we can
leverage some of those connections to
bring more workshops and more subject
areas to more communities and that&#39;s not
enough evolving a society isn&#39;t as
simple as bringing the fresh ideas to
the table that is the fun part though
the harder and probably more important
part is reforming what already is in
place ensuring the systems that are
already consistently affecting thousands
of youth are culturally relevant and
youth driven and community-based as well
luckily youth sound allows me to be a
part of that process too for the past 13
months I&#39;ve traveled Washington state
training practitioners of the behavioral
health system including counselors and
therapists care coordinators and
facilitators peer specialists like
myself and parent partners which is the
parent equivalent to my role even
secretaries and administrators now the
reason that a 22 year old rapper is
qualified to train all of those roles is
first my credential as a certified pure
counselor peer support isn&#39;t an idea
it&#39;s an evidence proven service it&#39;s a
medicaid-funded service so we&#39;re a real
thing but also the team that I travel
with
so what you see in the photo is myself
Michelle Shari and Andrea this is our
training team we&#39;ve all been personally
impacted by services and/or worked in
services in a variety of different roles
so our job as a team is to bring all of
our perspectives together equally to
share holistic information about how to
effectively meet the needs of youth and
systems we&#39;re able to create change
through dialogue dialogue about how the
system of care values translate to the
way that we interact with youth every
day and the way we design our systems
something that&#39;s common for me to hear
and talk through is questions about
whether a youths friends are positive or
negative influences or whether a youths
activities are positive or negative I
don&#39;t know if battle Roth would have
made the cut so those conversations
intrigued me how can we be relevant to
the cultures of youth if the first thing
that we do is question their culture and
how can we allowed youth and their
families to guide and drive their
services if the first thing we do is
question the culture that they already
have in place now behavioral health
practitioners don&#39;t want to be
judgmental I don&#39;t want to be judgmental
but I am and what I recognize and
service is is a cycle of stress that
makes relationship building hard not
because I see it in other people as a
trainer or something but because I&#39;ve
done it myself what it looks like is if
I&#39;m working in services and I&#39;m
partnering with and serving a youth I
get to know them for a very short period
of time I want to have as big of an
impact on them as possible so naturally
I&#39;m looking for the red flags and the
things that are going wrong the concerns
the issues that I think I might be able
to support them in fixing or working on
right and therapists even have another
level of accountability sometimes
because their accreditation z&#39;
can give them liability for the safety
of the youth that we serve so all of us
sometimes can fall into that trap of
looking for the red flags of course as a
youth and systems what that means is
that I have a team of strangers who I
haven&#39;t even built a relationship with
who are looking for all the bad things
happening in my life and all the
concerns and the dangers so naturally I
don&#39;t trust or like these people and now
I don&#39;t get to show them my best face so
they do see more of the red flags and
that makes things feel worse than they
are sometimes I&#39;ve perpetuated both
sides of that and
think that it&#39;s easy to fall into
because finding what&#39;s not working and
fixing it is an approach that works in
so many other facets of our life if I go
to the parking lot after this and my car
won&#39;t start because the starter is not
working I won&#39;t consider for an instant
whether I need to build up the motor to
be powerful enough that it makes up for
that broken starter or that the car can
fix this starter itself I&#39;m gonna find
someone who I hope knows how to fix the
starter and then I hope that I can drive
back to Spokane with people however that
counterintuitive approach of looking
past what&#39;s not working and building
what is working is often what&#39;s
effective stand-up comedy was never
trying to fix Nicole&#39;s mental illness
battle rap was never trying to fix my
trauma or my drinking what those things
did was look past our challenges and
build up our strengths enough that we
had enough of ourselves left that we
were able to address those things
proactively the first question that a
lot of us as youth entering systems ask
ourselves is why am I here am I here
because you think I&#39;m broken and you
need to fix me or you think something
about me is broken and you need to fix
that am I here because you see my
strengths and you want to build on them
am I here because the judge said I was
supposed to show up here and we all need
to check a box that says I did am I here
because my community believes in me
enough to make sure I can reach my goals
and the behavioral health practitioners
who find a way to answer that question
why am I here based on the youth
strengths and of course do so
authentically those are the people who
are connecting with youth effectively
every day but this isn&#39;t about just
giving you all a general update about
reforms occurring in behavioral health
services there&#39;s a bigger idea here that
pertains to all of us all this work that
we&#39;re doing as a system of care which is
connected to mental health substance use
juvenile justice even CPS foster care in
some ways even the medical and education
system all this work we&#39;re trying to do
falls under these three values and by my
interpretation all three of those system
of care values can be boiled down to one
idea as well and that idea is that
systems are learning to feel more like
community this is an important
investment for us to make because when
systems feel more like community we
support people in learning how to face
barriers and challenges and overcome
them with their community when people
get involved in systems like that they
don&#39;t rely on them again for years and
decades to come sometimes because they
have the skills to address those things
in the communities they&#39;re in what an
honor it is that we get to make such an
important investment in people the other
thing this idea represents though is the
responsibility that all of us hold just
as members of our community because all
of us know somebody who needs more
support from us
and we already know that person&#39;s
culture and what interests them and what
connects them to the people around them
systems are trying to catch up
communities will always be able to speak
languages and reach places and be there
at hours of the night that systems won&#39;t
be able to I think too readily and too
often we look to systems for answers
community is the most important resource
we have and my proof is that systems
want to be just like you when we grow up
thank you
[Applause]
