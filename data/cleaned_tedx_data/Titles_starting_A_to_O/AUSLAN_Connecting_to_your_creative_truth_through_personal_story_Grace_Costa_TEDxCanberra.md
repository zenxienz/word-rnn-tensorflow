I&#39;ve been a photographer for 17 years
and I started my career photographing
babies and kids and now I&#39;m
photographing high-profile leaders in
the corporate and military world and in
the past five years I&#39;ve been in
exhibiting artists showing my work in
galleries around Australia and the
reason I&#39;m talking about horses today
well they&#39;re the subject of my recent
and most successful photographic series
titled horse now the success of horse
led me to discover that when you connect
to your personal story
it creates vision which brings the
momentum of success and freedom as an
artist so now I&#39;m telling stories about
horses through my photography so what
made me create a series of photographs
about something that seems so damn
ordinary yet tells the story of my love
and challenges with horses well it
starts with my father my father angela
is a well respected horse trainer in
canberra and for the past fifty years
he&#39;s made it his life&#39;s work to
understanding horses on the deepest
level and he&#39;s taught me how to
understand their language and that&#39;s
something I never thought I would need
in my career as a photographer you see
my father&#39;s depth of knowledge goes so
deep it&#39;s like he knows what they&#39;re
thinking
and he can tell you what&#39;s about to
happen in that paddock over there with
five horses who have one bale of hay
between them which horse is going to be
the first to eat and kick and bite the
others before it happens in front of
your eyes we always have so many
different horses coming going through
our life as my father trains them but
there&#39;s only one horse our family horse
Chester who left a lasting impression on
me I learned to ride on Chester so he
built trust and confidence in me and he
said he said the standard for me
about what a horse should be respectful
trusting reliable Chester was strong and
powerful but had a gentle presence my
dad he&#39;d describe him
real class act just one in a million
horse but one day on our farming Hosken
in town New South Wales when I was just
15 years old I saw Chester laying in the
grass in a very scary position so I
screamed out to my dad in a panic who
raced over and could immediately see
that Chester
he had a twisted bowel the worse my
dad&#39;s ever seen he did everything he
could to try and save him but it was too
late
Chester couldn&#39;t be saved that day and
seeing him die
I knew I&#39;d lost my friend and I remember
crying myself to sleep
that entire following week but the truth
be told I haven&#39;t always felt confident
around horses in fact I could be so
nervous if I had to lead one of my
father&#39;s tall and frisky thoroughbreds
and I never understood why some horses
made me feel like this and some horses I
felt completely confident and in control
but the way I see it now it&#39;s all about
leadership and my dad&#39;s always taught me
to be a leader and not a follower in
life because horses are a herd animal
they need a leader to keep them safe
from predators and survive and I know
I&#39;m still learning to be a leader with
those horses that intimidate me but when
I was creating horse the series I had to
show my leadership to so many different
horses but when they came into my studio
space it was on my terms so I was able
to show complete confidence and control
so the horse series all started with an
idea I wanted to photograph individual
portraits of unbridled horses inside the
telescope building of the Mount Stromlo
Observatory which is now a ruin from the
Canberra bush fires it&#39;s this huge round
concrete room that has doorways with no
doors and huge windows without glass and
no rooftop just open to the beautiful
sky I wasn&#39;t interested in photographing
horses in pretty landscapes I
wanted to bring them into my world and
these portraits had to represent horses
the way I see them in the way I saw our
beloved horse Chester strong powerful
and showing presence but was I&#39;m mad to
invite a horse to the top of this
mountain and turn these telescope
building into a photographic studio with
flashing lights and expect a horse to
stand completely still for its portrait
of course I was freaking mad but
something inside me knew that it might
be worth it so I was so excited to tell
my mentor here&#39;s a photographer I look
up to as a working artist he also
exhibits his work and I shared my
exciting new idea with him but he said
to me grace I know how much you love
horses but for the sake of your career
don&#39;t do it think of something else
something more original I couldn&#39;t
believe this idea I was so excited about
wasn&#39;t going to come to life he
basically kicked my imagination to the
curb but you know as time went on and I
was seeing other photographers doing
work that they were personally connected
to and having success with it gave me
the push I needed to start this work
with horses because deep down I knew
that if anyone and I mean anyone in this
world could do this work with horses it
had to be me I had the knowledge and the
passion for horses I&#39;ve loved them my
whole life for God&#39;s sake and I had the
skills in photography so it was time for
me to make my art a reflection of my
world and be my own creative leader so I
needed my dad&#39;s help to see if this idea
was even possible ice explained the idea
to him and he said you want to do what
with the horse GE there&#39;s no doubt about
you Gracie he always says that when I
give him such crazy ideas and I said
trust me dad it&#39;s going to look a may
using but all I need you to do for me is
get up at six o&#39;clock in the morning so
you can watch Pepe from head to tail
sparkling clean put him on the truck
drive him all the way up that long
narrow winding mountain to the top of
Mount Stromlo where I&#39;ll meet you and
that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to do the shoot
the first test shot with Pepe turned out
exactly as I envisioned in my mind I
love how the tones in the horse and
mirroring the tones in the building just
so perfectly and look how he&#39;s showing
his presence to me so strong and
powerful I was so excited with his image
I just couldn&#39;t wait to do more and get
this new series of portraits under way
but I needed more horses I do you want
to photograph the ones my dad had so but
what if other people weren&#39;t willing to
bring their horse to the top of that
mountain for me and then what if their
horses didn&#39;t behave as well as my
father&#39;s do and then how is it going to
find the right people to help me on this
shoot with the lighting equipment and
stuff that works scared of horses man
this is the logistical nightmare but my
vision is so stronger I have to find a
way to do it and with Canberra having
the most horses per capita of any
Australian Capital City it was the
perfect place for me to search so I
started a Facebook campaign to find the
specific colors and breeds of horses I
wanted but some horses came on the sheet
well they weren&#39;t like they appeared on
their application photos oh my god I
think it must be like online dating
where people are secretly using pictures
from two years ago when they were
younger and fitter and had better hair
but sourcing the horses was only the
beginning of my challenges to creating
this series
I&#39;d say photographing a horse is twice
as difficult to photographing a kid for
a start there&#39;s twice as many legs to
control
because horses don&#39;t stand still for
long or if they do they&#39;re so damn
relaxed they&#39;re practically falling
asleep standing up but this is Danny&#39;s
portrait and then the horses ears are
moving all the time because they&#39;re
constantly communicating showing their
emotion and no expression and listening
with their is so it was vital that every
single portrait I took had the ears
pointed forward showing a positive
interested alert looking horse but did
you know that E is move independently of
one another too so like well one is
moving forward the others pointing
toward his ass and I knew that used to
work together in a team but this is
Wesley&#39;s portrait and then getting the
horse&#39;s body and the legs into that
perfect position I&#39;d get it just right
and then the horse just starts walking
out the door before I could even take
the picture this is blues portrait then
oh my god getting the horse&#39;s attention
well for a kid you know a squeaky toy
works just fine but for a horse man we
tried everything from rustling the
carrot bags to jumping up and down like
lunatics to plain horse sounds even
scuffing our thongs along the ground it
got stupid but this is Jerry Jemma&#39;s
portrait and then there were the toilet
miss house
I didn&#39;t even think of this when I first
started this project so the first time a
horse did a big wet sloppy poo inside
the building all I had with me was a
dustpan and brush this is Jerry&#39;s
portrait since then the horse named jock
comes along jock is a Shia stallion they
use him for breeding and he walked off
the horse flight and my jaw just dropped
because I&#39;ve never seen a horse like him
before and immediately I was scheming
how can I convince my dad to start
investing in shire horses instead of
thoroughbreds but he had the grand
presence of a six foot tall bodybuilder
with his chunky chest and shoulders he
stands 18 hands high which is huge even
for a tall person like me oh you all
know I&#39;m not too old he&#39;s right with his
gorgeous golden belly on this shiny dark
coat and a long thick glamorous tail
that&#39;s almost to the ground he&#39;s posing
for me like a true supermodel looking me
straight in the eyes the perfect moment
well until I look a little closer and it
appears jock was way too excited to have
his picture taken
and that I was not willing to retouch
that&#39;s enough of that you can see now
why it felt impossible with every single
horse everything had to align in order
to capture that perfect pose with the
perfect lighting composition and framing
all together in a fraction of a second
I wasn&#39;t guaranteed any great results
but with patience and a shitload of
patience and determination I was able to
get a result like this now my vision was
ready to come to life after 12 months in
the making but this is when I really
started doubting myself and my work as
I&#39;m sure you know other creatives out
there you can relate to that
when you jump on this emotional roller
coaster
one minute you feel like your works not
good enough the next minute you feel
like you need to start all over again
and the next minute you just love what
you&#39;ve seen you think you&#39;re a genius
but I needn&#39;t have got so caught up in
all that drama because the result of
sharing horse was so much better than I
ever could have imagined and now the
opportunities that are coming my way
since the launch in 2016 not only to
share the making of this work but in
creating more work like this in the
future
you know I&#39;ve sold more work in this one
exhibition then I have in my entire
photographic career horse was accepted
into the biggest Australian
international photography festival in
Sydney this year I&#39;ve had interviews and
feature articles in various equestrian
magazines and interior blogs and
podcasts I&#39;ve had invites to art shows
and it&#39;s led me to stand on this big red
circle sharing my story with you because
hard work does pay off thank God for
that
and believing in your vision is so
necessary and telling your story is
worth it
so then what makes horse so different to
other exhibitions I&#39;ve had in the past
well the other work I haven&#39;t been as
personally connected to they weren&#39;t as
successful and no opportunities came
from them they simply haven&#39;t come from
my heart like horse does so then how do
I know that when you connect to your
personal story
it creates vision which brings the
momentum of success and freedom because
when you connect your personal story it
gives others around you something to
connect with also through their lived
experiences and that creates a whole new
network of possibility I know because I
have a sense of freedom and purpose in
my creative work and I can honestly tell
you I feel like I&#39;ve found my true place
as an artist and that feels amazing
because I don&#39;t have to be like anybody
else I&#39;m my own creative leader you see
no one can tell your story like you can
your creative truth it comes from you
and only you can bring that into the
world something my mentor said to me was
unoriginal it turns out to be so
original because it&#39;s my story and
nobody else has that you see your story
it belongs to you and you belong to your
story so let your art be a reflection of
your world by course is for me so what&#39;s
your story you need to share with the
world
you
