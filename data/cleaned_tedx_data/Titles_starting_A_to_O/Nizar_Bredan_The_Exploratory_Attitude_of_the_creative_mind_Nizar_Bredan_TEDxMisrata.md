if you take this guitar there are
several things you can do with it and
there are several ways to explore its
strings right so you can just basically
play strings one by one individually or
you can play on one same string or of
course you can play on all the strings
together
just to come up with maybe a personal
melody so what I like to suggest is that
passions and hobbies and all kinds of
activities actually are exactly the same
thing as those strings and it&#39;s actually
my passion for exploration my love of
exploration that me grew up in various
artistic fields and led me to realize
how powerful combining different
activities can be and I think that
exploration has two different dimensions
it has a navigational dimension it has a
deepening dimension so we can just
navigate through different types of
activities and jump from one to another
and we can go deeper and deeper and
focus on just one same practice and to
illustrate this idea I&#39;d like to share
my experience and part of my exploratory
journey throughout several passions that
I developed and the first one is
photography I discovered my passion for
photography during my master&#39;s degree in
architecture and so I got into
architectural photography and what I
learned is that architectural
photography is not just about taking a
beautiful picture of a building
it&#39;s more solar than that you know our
reaction when we see architecture
photography should not be wow that&#39;s a
beautiful picture but rather Wow
that&#39;s a beautiful building so it&#39;s very
subtle I had to study it in depth and
practice it a lot and eventually what
happened is that it served me in
architecture because I acquired a more
sensitive eye on the importance of light
and shades and the relationship between
them and materials and their properties
and I eventually got even a better sense
of proportions in architectural design
itself
so really photography helped me in
architecture so that was already
interesting to me and then I began a
journey throughout different kinds of
photography such as city photography and
that was
turned out pretty different from
architecture and I learned new things
from there and I went to discover street
photography as well and that was very
interesting as well because it has a
very spontaneous aspect and I got deeper
into it by focusing on very particular
themes such as shooting children for
instance and I really loved that a lot
and so that made me go deeper because I
really had to think of what is the best
way to express that particular theme
then I went to shooting landscapes and
with landscapes of course I had to show
the whole scenery in front of me so I
had to learn how to make panoramas and
stitching pictures all together and
eventually I could apply this technique
to architecture and city photography as
well so actually every time I start
something new I don&#39;t know in advance
what I&#39;m gonna learn or how I&#39;m gonna
benefit from it but every time I do I
really learn something and it nourishes
my general practices and one of the most
important things that I learned in
photography and this variety of types is
that even one degree in an angle of view
can make a big difference in a picture
now one day an artistic director from a
company called dos Santos called me and
she was actually a friend of mine and
she asked me to shoot one of her live
performance shows and you know when you
ask someone who&#39;s been just shooting
buildings and nature so basically just
static subjects in broad daylight most
of the time to shoot you know a live
performance in the dark with people
jumping around it&#39;s like it&#39;s like
asking a mechanic to remove someone&#39;s
tooth you know it&#39;s it&#39;s very risky you
know I just don&#39;t do it so what happens
that at that time I never did that
before and I didn&#39;t even have the right
equipment to shoot it and also she told
me that half of the performance is gonna
be lit with just one single candle I
mean come on that&#39;s not a lot of light
so I had all the perfect excuses
to refuse that mission and of course I
accepted and it turned out very good
actually and she called me back for
another project on which we collaborated
together and that was really a great
great experience we made a photo
exhibition out of it which is still
alive today and traveling from one place
to another so it was a beautiful
performance here really rich in emotions
and I mean this guy is incredible and in
this picture I always think you know
it&#39;s like a mechanic just removed one of
his tooth you know anyway so to another
activity an artistic feel that I got
passionate about it&#39;s digital art and
photo montage and what is photo montage
basically is gathering pictures from
different sources mashing them up
together and come up with an
illustration very harmonious
illustration so just to give you a quick
example of an unlikely scenario that I
thought of I just start with a flower
feed and I add a guy there okay but I
don&#39;t really like the expression on his
face so I just change it a little bit
okay and I go on with a few more twists
and I had a friend of him there but I
didn&#39;t write II really liked his head
neither so I just chop it off and and
replace it with a leopard and there is
the final image now don&#39;t ask me how I
thought of this I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just
like there are fireworks in my brain
sometimes I came with this idea so what
was really exciting to me is that I
could think of anything in my head once
I master the tools I can just make
illustration no matter how crazy they
are and I remember one day I dreamt of a
horse playing football with Cristiano
Ronaldo and well just made it you know
really had lots of fun with their doing
it so
so well how I got deeper into into that
and the way I got deeper is I go through
what I call mind shifts and basically
mind shifts to me is like getting out of
the usual path and starting to do
something new you know in the same field
so what I started to do is trying
different styles and techniques so I
remember one day I was very bored at
home alone and I did this you know and
this is pretty representative of the
mess that&#39;s going on in my head
sometimes but it&#39;s very different inside
compared to the previous ones so I
really tried to do something new and I
tried new techniques but still using the
same tools as I used to do and I also
tried hand drawing again using the same
softwares now there&#39;s still another
passion of mine I didn&#39;t talk about
which is the composing music and playing
on piano so one day I had an idea I
thought hey why don&#39;t I extend the soul
of my music pieces into another
dimension so what I started to do is
creating illustrations for my pieces of
music that express in the best way the
concept of the music so here I started
to combine music and photo montage and
the idea I really like the idea so I
applied it to other pieces of music and
actually started to become more and more
aware of you know the potential of
combining different skills together so
what I started to do is act actually
applying exactly the same process of
photo montage to my architectural
project and I call this inviting people
into my imagination actually so there&#39;s
another good example as well of like
strumming all the strings of a guitar
right and it&#39;s a project of a hotel that
I worked on I start with the basic
sketch your hands
i Billiton 3d model and what&#39;s about
this buildings that it was called the
pearl so I wanted to be very homogeneous
so I got this idea of covering the whole
building with some kind of skin so I had
to work on the drawings and texture of
that skin I tried different ones and
finally I got I chose one of them and
there was still one step ahead which is
making this model look more
photorealistic which involves you know
learning new software&#39;s again so
basically the result we see here is a
combination of architectural design hand
drawing 3d modeling Eunos texturing
research computer-generated image as
well as photography because in
photography I learned how to choose the
best angle of view to show a project so
this is a really good example of how I
strummed all this the strings of my
guitar so I started applying this all my
of most of my architecture project and I
became more and more aware of this
potential of combining skills together
so that I could even apply it on small
details like hanging my own pictures in
my 3d models this is a villa I designed
for a friend in libya so you&#39;re probably
more familiar with this picture and my
latest artwork is a series of pictures
that I call digital memories and I had
to go into exploring very new techniques
I never tried before to express the very
vivid detailed and scattered memories
that manifest in our mind so that is
really something very personal that I
really had to develop a personal
approach for and I think that we can
come across this process of combining
things together pretty randomly or by
accident so what I&#39;d like to suggest is
to really think about it very
consciously and
because the process is pretty simple
it&#39;s about exploring different
activities identifying which skills to
combine to finally create something very
personal and distinctive that defines
our approach and style and what I really
think is you know I am aware that the
environment I grew up in in Belgium
really helped me develop these different
autistic skills and activities while the
situation here in Libya does not offer
as many opportunities however there I&#39;d
like to just point out a few things and
the first one is that being in an
environment full of opportunities does
not necessarily mean we are going to
exploit those opportunities when someone
who&#39;s in an environment with very few
opportunities may reach better
achievements with some effort and there
are many many real-life examples I can
think of in both cases the second point
is that I really think we can start with
very little resources we don&#39;t have to
go into you know buying expensive
equipments or you know getting a lessons
and trainings etc you know I myself
started playing music on a toy that my
parents bought for my sister I
discovered my passion for photography
using give a basic compact camera that&#39;s
worse than most smartphones used today
and I learned the rendering process of
architecture basically locked in my room
you know sometimes during holidays I
wanted to play video games instead but
you know I really had this in mind so
really I think it&#39;s more about general
curiosity and strong perseverance and
all that happened before the explosion
of internet learning videos so which
brings me to the next point that is
Internet is a real big game-changer in
the world of education today and
educating ourselves have become
accessible to anyone who&#39;s got an
internet connection basically and
fortunates becoming more and more common
in Libya as well and they&#39;re a very last
point I&#39;d like to mention is that I&#39;d
like to make you just think outside the
box you know
I realize that most of the things that I
talked about are autistic related so the
thing is it&#39;s not necessarily related to
art you know I have a cousin who had a
passion for motorcycles and you know it
helped him in many many ways for another
passion he developed for riding horses
so really it&#39;s not related to art and we
should really open up the scope of
possibilities with this concept and so I
really encourage anyone not just those
artistically inclined to try an
exploratory journey that may lead him or
her to unexpected horizons so to you who
is who are curious about yourselves
I&#39;d like to suggest you to take your
inner guitar and explore your strings of
passion and just play your own melody to
the world thank you very much
[Applause]
