I&#39;m here to expand and change how you
think about build and live in community
actually I owe this to you because in my
life community has changed and affected
me in more ways than I could count how
will we create a future that&#39;s not just
on an improvement but one that is more
deeply connected and fulfilling the
answer to that question for me is
community most of us carry our own
meaning of the word but the root and
suffix common unity seemed to sum it all
up common unity is something I&#39;ve always
sought I spent a lot of time looking at
other cultures with a sense of envy at
traditions and rites of passage and
ritual that indicated this sense of
connectedness and belonging that I
didn&#39;t see a lot of in the America that
I grew up in common unity shows up in my
life in four ways through a connection
of minds when I have the opportunity for
dialogue discussion and permission to be
curious connection of spirit broadening
my sense of place self and meaning in
the world connection of citizen when I
can join an align with another to
exponentially increase my own potential
for impact and connection of people
reminding me that I&#39;m not alone and that
others love and care for me I actually
came to value community through the
absence of
I always had this desire for deeper
connection that was a primal need for a
sense of belonging and greater purpose
where did I fit in where was I my best
self made better by what you brought out
in me I believe that community completes
her soul that every person has the
capacity to expose a part of me that can
exponentially increase my ability for
impact I was adopted at birth and raised
by two people that gave me a phenomenal
foundation of love in my life I was an
only child as were they so I had no
extended family and life took my parents
away early my dad died when I was nine
and my mom got terminally ill when I was
13 and then I became her primary
caregiver and she passed away when I was
18 that situation gave me a perceived
license to be angry and resentful at the
world for robbing me of experiences that
I felt that I was owed I began to see
the world through a lens of self-pity
hmm so I realized one day I&#39;m 29 years
old I&#39;m I&#39;ve been sober for a year and
I&#39;m at a friend&#39;s house and
house-sitting and after a relapse and a
rather rough time trying to get back
together I decided I was ready to try
again
so she had a pool in her back yard and
I&#39;m at this pool and I&#39;m floating on the
pool and just asking myself how do I
want to be in this world do I want to be
in this world and I knew that there was
an answer other than self pity and the
answer came to me almost like the
spiritual awakening I was floating on
the pool the Sun was really hot the
water cool and tears were just streaming
down my face I was asking what was I
doing on my own I&#39;d lived in the streets
I had gone to drinking establishments to
find my friends and I had been in the
backseat of a police car more times than
I&#39;d care to mention and then all of a
sudden I got this glimpse that every
time I had gotten to the other side of
loss grief or loneliness I had done so
with the support of others every time I
came to realize my potential to be more
or become more was when I was part of
something that was bigger than me and
then I got this sharp clarity that there
was more of me when I was connected to
you and in that moment I realized that
being a victim was a choice and not the
one I wanted to make I saw this greater
good in the
world and I knew that I was a part of it
and even entitled to some of it and I
knew that I wasn&#39;t alone so even
sometimes when you are alone and then
you meet someone else that&#39;s alone
there&#39;s this sense of instant
togetherness you have this opportunity
to transcend from me to we and this we
becomes a way of greater caring and I
believe it&#39;s the perfect place for
community building to start I found my
community in a lot of different places
some of them were as traditional as a
church or as an orthodox as a mafia bar
as conventional as a 12-step meeting or
as raw as a support group to rape
victims and every time I came together
with individuals in a like situation I
got what I needed to get to the other
side
every time I joined in community my
situation was normalized and almost okay
as a parent I have made community of the
utmost importance for a family value for
us because I didn&#39;t have family I wanted
to make sure that it was a core value
where our decisions were made from and
we even expanded our definition of
family and invited in exchange students
to our home and we had one from Brazil
and one from Lebanon and they are
brothers to my boys now and part of our
family and at one point we created this
intergenerational program where adults
were matched with kids and relationships
are still in place today from that
community can be family and for those of
us who had a dysfunctional
or unhealthy family creating community
can be a better way to know family even
though some of us don&#39;t or won&#39;t we are
wired to connect through all life
species researcher and author Margaret
Wheatley states that the instinctive
community is not peculiar to humans it
crosses all life forms from microbes to
the most complex of species through our
biological roots we are wired to be more
than isolated individuals so how do you
build a community where do you start I
want to suggest first that you recognize
that you&#39;re part of a community your
family workplace schools past and
present oftentimes were very comfortable
simply being a member of a community but
I want to suggest that if you own a
leadership role that it&#39;s a
transformative step that&#39;s available to
anyone community building is hard
leadership is hard and it can be
unnatural but it&#39;s available for all of
us there were times when I was needy
that I thought I was building community
but really I was trying to fill this
hole inside of me that&#39;s not leadership
and it&#39;s not community building before I
could build a community or recognize my
own potential as a leader I had to be my
own community I had to know who I was
and what my passions were and I had to
not need you to complete me and only
when I spent the time to learn what I
cared about was I able to ask you to
join me in my work I&#39;m fortunate enough
spend time with hundreds of leaders and
one thing I&#39;ve noticed in their quest to
make a difference is that they all do it
different it&#39;s like their fingerprint
there&#39;s no one right way a good leader
collaborates and knows how to listen
they don&#39;t have all the answers but they
know how to ask questions to get the
answers that they need and they know how
to align their actions with stated
intentions a good leader empowers others
to find their voice and recognize their
strengths so before I leave you today I
want you to see a path to expand your
community and make a difference in your
world you join a community when you find
a group that aligns with who you are or
want to be trust is fundamental and then
you have to have a purpose for spending
your time there and then you have to
participate participation is why I
believe that community can start small
with that we and it all begins with a
conversation create common unity using
the connections of mind citizen spirit
and people to build your bridge from
passion to purpose there are so many
questions and challenges in this world
that look need answers and you taking an
active role to lead in your community is
the best chance we all have so I ask you
to embrace community and know that there
is more of you when you are connected
to others thank you
