I want to tell you about what happened
in the classroom in the Wi-Fi free war
zone where banter is a bully&#39;s best
bullet and battle cry jabs bounce off
tripping tongues and your best bet is
bite back or be broken by cheap shots
and belittling and badly built word
bombs boom and you&#39;re beaten can I tell
you what happened in the classroom in
the post break times ooh well if the
monkeys are suddenly free from their
cages ripping up pages we printed and
swinging from tales of too much sugar
and not enough attention we&#39;re best mate
primates become incubated irritated
inmates well we are suddenly keepers of
the worst kind of secret so can I tell
you what happened around the table a
dozen doubters gathered student soldiers
studded with swear words scars and packs
of creatures wild enough to rip your
smile off and swallow it whole we lured
them in while nooses of words around
their necks alphabetic traps for them to
fall into unaware through rope-ladder
metaphors in the trenches for them to
climb out until they were ours and then
it happened
they sang tuneless songs in slang for us
they listened to each other because
their stories were worth listening to
they let images fall into their laps and
lock them up drinking poetry like
lucozade buzzing off the energy of what
they had created then the Bell went the
cool to battle feeding time at the zoo
and the soldiers rose from their chairs
the chimps grabbed their bags and
scampered off into the corridors and
teeth were bared and bullets flew but I
was there I saw it it happened the best
kind of secret is the kind that is kept
in the bottom of school bags in the
scrape of plastic chairs and in the
voices of students who despite what they
say kind of sort of care my name is
Sarah and I&#39;m a prophet and a spoken
word educator and until I handed my
dissertation in this morning a master&#39;s
student
and before I was a poet I was an actor
and before I was an actor I was training
here to be an actor and before that I
was a secondary school student and when
I was at school something really really
bad happened to my family when I was 12
my father died now that&#39;s a statement
I&#39;ve got really good at saying but when
I was younger that sentence would catch
him my throat stick its arms out and
adamantly refused to come out I found it
really really difficult to talk to
anyone about what had happened on the
day he died I wrote a poem about it
because I was that kind of kid it&#39;s a
really terrible poem but it was slightly
easier to say than what I was feeling
which brings me to what I am now which
is a full-time poet also a sentence I
never thought I&#39;d be able to say poetry
allows me to take control of my
experience and repurpose it in a
creative way to distance myself from it
as soon as you introduce rhyme or rhythm
or character to a difficult experience
it&#39;s harder to feel like it&#39;s something
that happened to you and easier to see
objectively like a story and I don&#39;t
know about you but I find stories a lot
easier to tell them the truth
poetry allows me to be the most
articulate version of myself often about
the things that are otherwise too hard
to talk about now a big part of being a
poet for me is facilitating other people
in telling their stories I&#39;ve just
finished a two-year placement as spoken
word educator at Lamaze school in Layton
East London now this particular school
has high numbers of students for whom
English is an additional language
many of them have just arrived in the UK
with harrowing stories of fleeing
war-torn countries caught in their
throats and a huge percentage of the
pupils are classified as underprivileged
as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware schools across
the country are sinking from similar
burdens and government lifejackets are
few and far between these are the kind
of schools that really need work like
this and the kind of schools that are
finding it harder and harder to afford
it
so what did my role look like well
essentially by working two days a week
as a permanent creative force within the
English department I bridged the gap
between visiting poet and
I worked alongside the curriculum to
encourage confidence creativity and
communication through poetry workshops
one-on-one support projects and poetry
slams I also led the GCSE unseen poetry
unit for year 11 and nurtured a
school-wide culture of spoken word now
getting kids to write their feelings
down is nothing new it&#39;s therapeutic we
know that but writing something down and
saying something out loud are two
completely different things and as much
as I love writing I don&#39;t actually
approach this work as a writer I like to
think of myself more like a trained
actor with a terrible writing habit the
theatre practitioners Jacques Lecoq
admits that he came to theatre by way of
sport the geometry of the parallel bars
at his local gym and the movement of the
body through space transported him from
one form of expression to another in
turn I come to poetry by way of theater
when I approach a poem I do so in the
same way that I&#39;d go about creating a
play or tackling a monologue in simple
terms I want to find a truthful and
interesting way to express my intention
I want to use language economically to
its full potential
I want to entertain and I am at all
times completely aware of the audience
I&#39;ve labeled my approach as a pedagogy
of performance where equal value is
placed on both the written and the
spoken word because just speaking with
no parameters just improvising can be
scary sometimes it certainly was for me
whereas taking the time to construct
something meaningful and then the act of
reading it out can for some people be
extraordinarily liberating and the
results are transformative take the two
softly spoken thirteen-year-old Muslim
girls who stood up in front of their
male-dominated class and performed
powerful poems about feminism or the boy
at the year seven slam who spoke out
about bullying with his perpetrators in
the audience to an entire year group
applauding his bravery or the 15 year
old refugee who traveled from Syria to
London on his own and was desperate for
a safe space to simply share his story I
could go on and on about all the
humbling moments but I thought it was
better to let some of the students speak
for them
this is a poem written by a group of
year nine students in a workshop all of
whom have English as an additional
language and it was written about a
fellow classmate who is illiterate even
in his own language it&#39;s based on the
shape of his name in Pashto script my
name is a nervous tornado destroying the
city of Kabul
my name is a tired gray Jeep driving
from Afghanistan to London my name is
the Khalifa tower in Dubai too rich a
beautiful triangle in the ocean of sky
my name is a happy smile stretching
across London tower blocks my name is a
question mark honestly I wish I could
show you the size of his smile when he
realized we&#39;d constructed something that
celebrated his culture and identity this
is one of a handful of poems that was
published alongside mine written by a
student in my newest collection louder
than words
seeing their words in print gave these
students a sense of achievement that
they just don&#39;t normally get especially
if they&#39;re struggling academically it
gave them a chance to see what&#39;s
possible that their voices are important
and that their stories are valid sadly
the current system doesn&#39;t cater for
everyone creativity is being weeded out
of the curriculum and there is a
crippling emphasis being placed on
grades and numbers and no alternative
being offered for those who don&#39;t
necessarily excel it traditionally
academic subject in an ideal world there
would be a poet or creative force within
every school there specifically to help
young people express themselves and
develop transferable skills that they
wouldn&#39;t otherwise access the current
model is not representative of the real
world where you simply won&#39;t succeed at
a job interview without the skills to
talk about yourself and your experience
if favors those whose parents are able
to help them with presentation and
communication skills outside of school
it is elitist and it shouldn&#39;t be spoken
word isn&#39;t for everyone
but it&#39;s often for those who don&#39;t
expect it to be sometimes simply giving
a kid a chance to be heard is enough to
unlock whatever was making them a
disruptive force in the classroom and it
also gives teachers
insight into the kids they teach that
they just don&#39;t get from essay answers
this is what they teach me today I
learned that the boy with the untucked
shirt feels more than he lets on all he
told me is that home is a basketball
court all he said is that he gets
bounced around one too many times
all he admitted is that the crowd
doesn&#39;t support the team they shift
themselves too loudly it seems today I
learned that the girl at the back of the
class is struggling all she told me is
that she is dirt walked all over she dug
her eyes deep into the earth when she
told me this it didn&#39;t muddy her
sentiment she is sediment sewing her
seeds waiting to grow out of all of this
out in the corridor Toby becomes a
pressure cooker right at my feet takes
four teachers
untrained in this to become a
straitjacket today I learned that in
this sometimes classroom sometimes
waiting room there is a table of
children whose family are airmail
postage stamps and they have forgotten
the address or maybe just the language
it is written just beyond the door the
only way Toby can explain why he is the
way he is is by turning his tonsils into
razor blades and his feet into catapults
all that he told us is that his hurt is
so deep we should not try to help in
case we fall into all that he showed us
is that the floor will not discriminate
between stamps of feet and those have
heads all that he meant remains
encrypted in his kicks the kid who sits
on her own tells me the clouds are an
army waiting to attack
most imagine marshmallows I remember all
too well what it felt like when it was
always just about to rain I believe the
current curriculum is ill-equipped to
deal with this generation and the
specific issues and tensions they&#39;re
faced with like Trump or brexit or the
refugee crisis which I&#39;m sure is far
more real in an East London classroom
than it is in Westminster this work
helps to productively absorb the trauma
of it all and with its inherently
political undertones gives them the
tools to protest and not to brag or
anything but spoken word is cool
like it&#39;s in touch with current friends
and until they stop teaching poetry by
dead white guys in the syllabus this
work is bringing 2017 into the classroom
kids love rap and they connect way more
with the idea of creating lyrics or slam
poems than they do with writing flowery
poetry as it&#39;s often perceived this
teaches them without teaching them
developing skills in literacy rhetoric
and even textual analysis without them
even knowing and it gives them a
positive role model with a career in the
arts giving them hope that if they&#39;re
not academic it&#39;s still more than
possible for them to forge a successful
path for themselves alternative
approaches to education are needed now
more than ever the current system is
failing the most vulnerable in our
society instead of celebrating their
resilience individuality and
imaginations and trust me these kids
have that in abundance this work
encourages young people to take agency
over their experiences
it shows teachers that there are
creative geniuses in their classrooms
that they haven&#39;t noticed because maybe
their handwriting is terrible
spoken word education gives a voice to
the voiceless I&#39;d like to end this talk
in the same way that I began with a poem
this is a poem that I often deliver at
the beginning of a workshop or class I
don&#39;t believe in getting young people do
to do something that I&#39;m not prepared to
do myself by showing them I can be
vulnerable
I give them permission to do the same
this poem is called present I keep my
father in the folds of his knitwear I
keep November in the neckline and his
surname in the color you cannot get a
darker green and still call it green
I remember when I&#39;d watched my mother
sew his name into my school uniform head
bent in concentration patience threaded
into her focus the likes of which I
wouldn&#39;t know for years I wore his name
with pride carved it cursive Leon to
exercise books answered to it in the
register always thankful to be near the
front never waiting like the woods or
the Thompsons for my turn to come around
it went at concern bagri brodo Carol
Delaney
Freitas green present I would call it to
the classroom sometimes we would joke
shout things like Christmas tree or brew
Dolf not understanding that the game was
not to name festive things that present
ment here that we existed that we were
proof of us introductions whence are
enou eight screen though II just like
the color his name would sit on my
tongue heavy like extravagant family
dinners and Christmas when everyone was
present now it lies printed on my bank
card like a secret it is passports and
pay slips the other me is self-employed
I only use it when I have to like tax
avoidance of a pass that no longer fits
each November I pull my father out from
his drawer dust off another year without
him and pull his name over my head
sometimes his jumper is a hug sometimes
it is strength and sometimes just a
vintage item for people to blindly
compliment unaware that it is not an
attempt at fashion I tell them it was a
present that it belonged to someone else
before me that it is proof that he was I
wear him through the month he stopped
existing like armor leather shroud like
evidence his jumper is my mood that
month you cannot get a darker green and
still call it green I wear him as we
approach another Christmas without his
presence to ward it off like Scrooge
like Grinch I steal back the years I
steal back my name I wear it for a while
try it on for size
feels like my mom has sewn me into it
and with her patience I make it through
the month then he goes back in his
drawer neatly folded waiting like the
woods for his name to be cooled I keep
him waiting I keep him in the fold of
his knitwear I keep November in the
neckline and his surname in the color
thank you very much for listening
[Applause]
