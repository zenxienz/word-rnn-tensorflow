imagine yourself in a school where you
asked to be dressed from head to toe and
you&#39;re not allowed to step out of your

dorm after 6:30 p.m.
men in the audience you were absolutely
fine you can go and work in your library
and even work in your workshop spaces
till midnight or even 24/7 but women out
there dare you step out this is all
being done for you in the name of safety
and not abiding by this would mean that
you&#39;re asking for it and probably an
immediate suspension from this cool this
is exactly how my undergraduate school
life is
however since I wanted to build things
and really do hands-on engineering I
decided to break these laws I did skip
me out I did sneak out I did everything
wrong because I wanted to study and
sometimes even hide under that desk when
god schemed patrolling and looking for
me I can&#39;t forget that day when my
mother called me crying after a phone
call from my directors office
they were probably planning to throw me
out of the institution my mother was
very upset she asked me a bunch of
questions
why can&#39;t you behave like a normal good
why do you have to go out and really
work 24/7 and these labs what do you
think they&#39;re gonna protect you if you
get sexually abused at night what are
you gonna do I didn&#39;t have answers to
all of the questions then so I kept
quiet but deep inside I knew that I am
NOT going to stop months later the
nearby a gang rape case happened in New
Delhi December 16 2012 the barbaric
incident brought the entire country on
streets people marched holding
mendl&#39;s asking for justice asking for a
change but there in one corner of my
room I was sitting all by myself asking
how I could contribute how I could
intervene as a woman as an engineer and
as a wit
yes as a victim of sexual assault myself
I decided I want to take a different
route years later at MIT as a graduate
student we started looking at how
technology CLE we could intervene in the
space of sexual abuse and we decided
bunch of areas through education through
direct detection communication and
prevention methodologies at MIT when we
were going through all of this we
realized that as a community we have a
great system set up in the preventive
space we go and do everything possible
to prevent sexual abuse and we try to
dictate a person&#39;s life in every
possible way from the way they dress up
to the way they walk to the way they
talk and if that even helps we can even
go down to disfiguring their body so
that they don&#39;t look sexually attractive
and on the other hand we also have a
great system which is truly great in
itself and I&#39;m not using sarcasm here
which tries to help a victim when they
have been abused and they&#39;re looking for
help we have a lot of centers which try
to help a person emotionally physically
and mentally to get out of the trauma
but there&#39;s a gray area between this
setup and that Sara they probably look
weightless to each other but there&#39;s a
time gap from the moment where a person
is sexually abused to the time when they
actually start talking about it and
asking for help this time gap is
directly dependent on where they come
from or what kind of torture they have
been going through it probably could be
hierarchical because nowadays we have a
lot
happening at work spaces right but this
can also be physical or emotional and
when we start looking at this dyeing gap
we realized that it is directly related
to also another factor geographical
location imagine if you are from any of
these 37 highlighted streets you can
probably be a victim of marital rape and
ask for justice but just think if you&#39;re
not amongst those and you&#39;re in the
other 13 or you come from a country like
India where marital rape is not even
recognized in the law books it&#39;s pretty
shocking yes and as we started going
through this I was very keen to even
just educate people around the space
which we as people need so we looked at
a speculative design project I really
hated when people told me to wear
clothes one top on top of each other
just to prove that I&#39;m not asking for it
so we did this project at MIT with my
colleagues this project is called as the
cultural lens you can see the guy in
this picture over here he thinks that I
am dressed inappropriately and since he
can&#39;t control he wears on this lens over
his eyes so that he can prove that he is
disciplined but on the other hand I
don&#39;t have to wear layers of clothing
just to prove that I&#39;m not asking for it
we wanted to go a step further in that
direction and really look for
technological inventions or
interventions which can prevent rape in
the real time and while we were trying
to do that we looked for inspiration
from nature and guess what we found
a skunk don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not gonna make
you people smell really bad
so skunk uses odor as a way to predators
in real time and we were quite
fascinated that odor could actually do
that so we looked at literature which
could actually define the relationship
between odor and how it helps in like
sexual arousal and those kind of things
and we found a lot of correlations in
that space
but we found something very interesting
which is a paper from science which
talks about how the scent of a teardrop
can make men less arousing and it can
already turn off their arousal rate so
we we got some cues from this paper and
since we were looking at college campus
sexual assault at that point which is
mostly caused because of sexual
attraction at the first place we thought
it would be a great intervention so we
got a IRB approved got a lot of people
in our lab made them smell different
kind of odors while they were being
sexually stimulated and we came across
with a palette which can actually do
that so we made all of these in the form
of accessories and now in a laboratory
setup we can actually demonstrate that
smells could be used for reducing the
libido effect within few seconds as a
victim of sexual abuse and both academic
and public spaces I do understand what
it takes for a victim to speak up and I
also understand what help means from the
time a person is actually abused to the
actual help they get there&#39;s a time gap
and we want to work on early detection
early communication and documentation
processes so we came up with an
interesting variable on body which is
like a sticker it sticks to your fabric
and detects difference between how you
remove your clothing versus if somebody
else is trying to remove your clothing
it takes that mapping and tries to
inform you and ask you if the act is
done with consent and imagine if a
person is incapacitated or is not in a
situation to fight against the assaulter
especially in cases like child sexual
abuse we would need technologies or
interventions which can actually
communicate it to the people who
actually can come for help so this
technology once a tree confirms with the
user and there&#39;s no response found in
the in there
a respective time frame it starts
buzzing a loud alarm and ask for help
from those predefined five people by the
user it also sends the information about
the location of the person and if
required it also calls one of the most
trusted member in the list and they can
hear everything about what&#39;s going on in
the background and it also records it to
make sure that if you&#39;re going for a
legal proceeding future in future you
can always get back to this and you can
document it and you can go ahead with
the process this device also has a self
actuation button which can be pressed by
the victim in case they are conscious
and they can understand an approaching
threat towards them I know that I needed
one of these devices when I was being
sexually abused in that dark night at

2:00 a.m. in my lab when my mentor was
trying to force himself on me
and I know that all those victim who are
being abused every 98 seconds in this
country are not asking for it as I
wasn&#39;t asking for it that day today as a
young woman as a survivor of sexual
abuse and a woman who wants to be a
future mom I really want to share my
concerns with you I don&#39;t want to force
my child into a fearful future but I&#39;m
concerned I don&#39;t want to clip my child
wings and dictate my child&#39;s life in
every possible way as it was done to me
today I stand before you not as an
individual but as the face of those
invisible victims who would never get
justice as the voice of those disabled
victims and children who wouldn&#39;t ever
be able to express what they&#39;re going
through and as the body of those who
have suffered innumerable scars and go
through the same trauma everyday they
think about that particular incident and
for all those parents millions of those
parents who fear about their child
safety every now and then I know we are
hundred thousand and millions of us
I urge to this crowd today to make the
unsafe safe the unarmed empowered so
that we can come together and build a
better future for our children for our
loved ones so that we can raise our
children the way they want to and I know
that we all can do this together in
whatever capacity we are in whatever
position we are because every voice
against sexual abuse matters thank you
[Applause]
