every day of her life is filtered
plastics the first thing you hit in the
morning is your snooze bar and then you
see the first thing in the morning
that&#39;s the plastic clock radio then you
you take your slippers with rubber
plastics below them you drag yourself to
the bathroom you hit the plastic light
switch the plastic cabled lights will
fall on you your plastic shampoo bottle
is there to take your plastic gel
container is there to take everything
plastic I think we all know that and so
the day goes on but what is intriguing
me is that we hardly know that those
plastics are surrounding us they don&#39;t
speak to us it&#39;s just dead plastics they
have no name no face no spirit no soul
no emotion
they are just dead plastic fantastic so
how much do we use many of us use about
one kilogram of plastic every day
consumption if you&#39;re a car owner you go
on about 350 kilogram of plastics with
that car
suppose you ride it for 10 years that
adds up for 35 kilo per year which adds
up to about hundred gram per day just by
owning a car you consume a hundred gram
plastics per day so imagine that 1
billion people start to consume like
this anywhere that adds up to 1 billion
kilogram of plastics right 1 million
tonne of plastics so if you visualize a
soccer field 1 million tonne of plastics
piles up to about 200 meter every day or
per year about 60 kilometer 7 Mount
Everest every year the point is as we
all know about 3 percent of the plastics
or ending up in nature we are gradually
polluting the system that has evolved
over four billion years with 3% which
corresponds to 6 meter soccer field
height per day or 2 kilometer per year
and you can wonder what is contributing
to that plastics because as we also know
I think those plastics are coming back
to us
they are infiltrating in the food chain
micro plastics I was in colognian the
first micro plastics symposium 2014 with
which was subtitled plastics are
everywhere and that&#39;s the truth if you
have your dishes with clamps it&#39;s about
hundred micro particles of plastics
inside there if you have honey if you
have bio honey
it contains micro plastics these are
flying with micro plastics around so we
eat them today they are in our bodies
they are in my body you can ask yourself
is this now toxic we don&#39;t know but I
know one thing we are a bit out of
control so luckily while we are having
smart discussions about transitioning or
linear economy into a circular economy
nature has started already circulating a
little bit for us
and we have been inventor izing a
so-called top 10 charts of the most
important contributors to those 6 meter
of plastics there here
cigarette butts day 1 also those contain
the plastics now I&#39;m a creator since I
was a child I prefer to write books more
than reading them I prefer to clip to
play the piano with own compositions
rather than play all this musics and
when I saw this list I was first of all
upset thinking about my two boys at home
and the story I had to tell them by just
understanding what is happening and I
only had one question and you can check
with my wife and children it became an
obsession
how can I attack this list how can I
change it how can I influence it because
if you compare it with the music charts
the music top 10 top 10 dirt whatever
the intriguing part of that is that it
changes over time so I personally wanted
to change that list and I fell on
position 7 straws we all know them I
have fun with me I will now tell you the
silly truth about straws it&#39;s black its
fossil based it means it comes from far
this one might have traveled like 10,000
kilometres to be here
welcome straw and it&#39;s made from non
degradable plastics so our behavior
makes it run to position 7 if it would
be blown away right so now those straws
we use it 5 times 5 seconds by the way
that&#39;s then 400 kilometer per second
logistics and 1 billion people do like
this so we use as humanity up to 1
billion of those straws per day so I
made a small calculation if he would all
drink one after the other with the straw
we would need like an eighth centuries
of sucking humanity is sucking eight
centuries per day every day again here
is the sack
and then physically if you line them up
and I cannot see the moon but I try to
go to the moon one day I suck off a the
moon two days I can suck on the moon so
okay you can ask yourself what are we
doing and that was what I asked this is
the case I want to Attack Position seven
is from now on my position and I asked
myself three things can we not make
straws from local bio crops could you
not make it here in the village
instead of Asia and could we not make it
and search away biodegradable that it
never runs to position 7 anymore because
then I changed that list mission
complete
so yes here it is it was a long journey
but it fulfills all criteria it&#39;s here
and now I cannot give it around you&#39;re
with too many but you can have it in the
shops as from this summer and it feels
good to me to be here with you to tell
about it because of course I hear you
ask yourself now ok so far so good but
what can I contribute potentially the
most important thing comes now I have
three things for you first of all as you
will leave this room you will never have
the same relationship with plastics as
you entered plastics will gradually
start to speak to you and you know you
can speak back you will have a
discussion with them
and you can always ask them treating in
good understanding can I refuse you can
i potentially reuse you right 11 years
with my car instead of 10 or can I have
and select the re-infuse evil one the
green one that can never reach position
7 anymore
I have to say that it&#39;s easy to show
this to you it was a long journey and I
think and I&#39;m grateful to the internal
voice that made it very clear to make
this you also have an internal voice and
we will need each other internal voices
and also the external voice is coming I
pick it up daily this team is swelling
it will guide us to the new future and
our children will need that new future
so whatever journey you take because we
will be on the same Road
whatever road you will take whatever you
will do whatever you choose I wish you a
lot of success and a lot of pleasure and
I say to you one thing don&#39;t suck thank
you
[Music]
