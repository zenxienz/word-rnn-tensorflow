I really struggled putting together a
title for today&#39;s talk so I had to asked
my wife for help
fortunately for me she&#39;s an
award-winning novelist and it took her
all of three seconds to say you need a
title
I got your title this is your site I
have the same passion I loved it but I
worried me a little bit after all this
is a TED talk so I thought I&#39;d soften it
a bit maybe go with this one but I was
still concerned so in the end I settled
on this last one that&#39;s an interesting
thing about these titles is that none of
the words presented are overtly vulgar
or profane but if you loved me you
filled in this missing information with
a word that could be considered taboo
now
cognitive psychologists many of them
study this generation process how do we
go about filling in this missing
information but I&#39;m actually interested
in the next step once we&#39;ve generated
something how does that influence our
later memory researchers have explored
the effect of generation on memory in
the lab since the late 1970s typically
using a procedure like this participant
comes into the lab and they&#39;re asked to
read a long list of words maybe 20 or 30
words though resemble this some of the
words are presented in their full intact
form so participants simply need to read
them aloud as they see them others are
presented as word fragments with one
letter missing before participants can
read these aloud they have to fill in
the missing letter but this tends to be
trivially easy and thoughts we could
demonstrate it right now but I need your
help
what is the second word
village fourth word Wow word fantastic
despite the relative ease of reading and
generating these words participants tend
to remember significantly more of the
fragmented or generated words compared
to the intact or read words the simple
act of filling in a missing letter can
boost your memory by 10 to 30 percent
depending on the conditions in the study
so why does this happen well it seems
that generation encourages more semantic
or meaning based processing during
encoding which then we additionally for
you to retrieve later on at tests now if
you&#39;re like most of my students you&#39;re
probably thinking this is interesting
but it all seems rather artificial
alright after all talk titles typically
don&#39;t contain missing words and you
rarely run into word fragments in your
daily lives I guess unless you&#39;re a fan
of crossword puzzles so for the rest of
today I want to share with you some
research from my lab and from my
classroom that explores two real-world
applications of the generation effect
and we&#39;re going to start with an
interesting project on lyrical
censorship and memory you&#39;ve most likely
experienced lyrical censorship to the
radio we&#39;ve been there listening and
then you notice that some of the lyrics
some of the artists words have been
omitted or obscured in some way
regardless of the method the logic and
the intent is clear if you can&#39;t hear
the word then you can&#39;t process the word
censorship is an attempt to limit your
processing just a couple of minutes ago
I showed you how easy it is for us to
generate missing information wouldn&#39;t it
be ironic then if this simple act of
censoring an item actually made that
item more memorable
when I made this connection I set out to
design a series of experiments to
explore whether we would see a
generation effect in the context of
lyrical censorship now all we have time
to describe a portion of one experiment
today but please know that the data are
representative of the entire program of
research so the first big decision I had
to make in this research project was
what kind of information should I censor
initially I thought I&#39;d used
traditionally censored materials curse
words drug references things of that
nature but I was concerned that this
information came from too small of a set
it&#39;s too well-known it might be too easy
for the participants to generate and in
fact this might be a class of words that
are inherently more memorable so instead
I decided to censor common nouns from a
song I thought this would be a more
difficult task for participants much
more challenging also I figured this is
a much larger and unknown set of
material plus if I use nouns we have
these things called normative data so I
could ensure that all of the words were
equally memorable at the outset of the
experiment so I wouldn&#39;t have to worry
about that so with the materials in mind
I chose a set of 30 common nouns words
like father and chair and I wrote a song
around them now you&#39;re probably thinking
why did he go through the trouble of
writing his own saw and songs exists in
the world well you see I needed to
equate song familiarity across my
participants which were college students
so I couldn&#39;t use anything too familiar
I suppose I could have chosen an obscure
song and obscure and but if you know
anything about college students
listening to obscure bands is kind of
what they do so I thought that would be
better off just designing my own
experiment designing my own song
so with the song in hand I decided to
manipulate sensor
in two different ways some of the
participants heard partially censored
information in which the initial speech
sound was still audible you can kind of
think of this as a sloppy version of
censorship which actually occurs quite
on the radio the other participants
heard completely censored lyrics so all
of the speech sounds were gone well I
wanted to give you a sense of what this
sounded like so I&#39;m going to play the
first line of the song two different
ways and we&#39;re going to start with the
departure the censored version so just
listen along it should be obvious when
the word is censored
anyone able to figure out the identity
of that missing word memory fantastic
well done let me take you on a trip down
memory lane here&#39;s what it sounded like
in the completely censored version
so all the sounds were gone there after
hearing the song I gave participants a
recognition memory test it would see a
word on the screen and they had to
decide whether that word was in this
song or not and all there were 60 words
in this recognition test so 60 separate
decisions 15 of the words had actually
been heard 15 were censored from the
song and then there were 30 nouns that
didn&#39;t appear in the song at all they
were distractor items so what did we
find
well first let me orient you to the
ground on the y-axis we have percentage
correct going from 0 to 100 and on the
x-axis we have the two different types
of censorship partial and complete we&#39;ll
begin with the heard words these were
words that were actually sung in the
song that actually went into their ears
you can see they recognized these words
rather well 65% and 61% accuracy for
those two conditions but now it&#39;s moved
to the interesting condition the
censored words remember these are words
that we never heard in the song words
that were either partially or completely
omitted intuitively you might think we
should have zero percent accuracy how
can we remember something that wasn&#39;t
even presented but based on the
generation effect
we&#39;re actually predicting something in
the opposite direction we actually think
that the generated words might be
remembered better than things they
actually heard that&#39;s exactly what we
found
88% and 80% accuracy for those two
conditions respectively ironically
lyrical censorship enhanced memory by
23% and 21% for censored words these
were statistically significant
differences now although these results
are impressive
please remember this was with college
students
our college students the target audience
for censorship who&#39;s the target audience
kids children right children are the
target audience now no one has yet to
run this experiment but I predict that
censorship will be effective for kids
especially very young children because
they&#39;re not particularly good at
generating information yet these are
skills that develop with time and
experience plus they might not even yet
know the identities of those censored
words how can you generate something if
you don&#39;t even know the word to begin
with
however lyrical censorship will become
less and less effective over time as the
kids age and as they gain more
experience now so far the generation
effect probably seems like something
that happens to us right it seems like
it&#39;s this automatic process that occurs
without our conscious intent or
conscious awareness so this begs the
question can we be more deliberate about
this can we actively use generation to
enhance our memory if we think a bit
more broadly about what it means to
generate information then we can easily
apply this to educational settings for
years in my courses I have encouraged
students to take advantage of the
generation effect as they study for
exams I&#39;d suggest that they generate
definitions and examples on their own
instead of trying to memorize those
provided in the book or I&#39;d suggest that
they omit certain key words in their
notes so when they&#39;re looking at over it
again they have to fill in that jet that
missing information and generate that
information surprisingly students never
listen to me and they never take this
advice and I don&#39;t understand it&#39;s but I
also kind of do understand it right
these are successful college students
they have spent a lifetime developing a
set of effective study strategies
and there were about didn&#39;t try
something new this late in their career
so if you&#39;re a professor like me and you
want to get your students to try
something new what can you do well the
solution is actually pretty simple you
just assign it as homework and this is
what I did in a couple of recent classes
I&#39;ve instituted a new semester long
project in which they had to generate
one multiple-choice question for each of
eight chapters across the term then at
the end of the semester I was interested
in whether this generation activity
influenced their performance on the
exams so for each student I went back to
see if there were any topics that they
wrote about that were left with the
topics that I tested on that is if a
student wrote a question on topic X and
then later on there happened to be an
exam question on topic X how did they
fare on that exam question so I compared
performance in that situation to over
all baseline performance how did they
Theron all of the non generated material
as you can see here performance in the
baseline or control condition was 76%
not surprisingly given what we know
about the generation affect students
fared much better
what with the generated content by
creating a multiple-choice question on a
topic they were able to improve their
performance on that topic by almost two
full letter grades presumably the act of
creating these questions encouraged more
semantic processing the students had to
think more deeply about the content and
that subsequently enhanced their
memories now I don&#39;t want to give you
the impression that this only works for
a multiple-choice although I don&#39;t have
data on this yet the logic should hold
for other types of tests as well whether
it be short answer or essay
so long as the generation process is
appropriate for the kind of test that
you&#39;re taking that is if you know you
have a short answer question coming up
you should probably spend time
generating and answering short answer
questions you want to make sure that the
kind of thinking you&#39;re doing during
study is appropriate for the kind of
thinking that you&#39;re going to be asked
to do at tests and now I hope I have
convinced you of the simple power of the
generation effect but if there are still
some skeptics in the audience I&#39;d like
to end by asking you one final question
what were the three talk titles from my
opening slide you might remember that
they were all questions you might not
remember the exact construction of the
questions but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll
remember these three items and whatever
you generated for them thank you for
using
