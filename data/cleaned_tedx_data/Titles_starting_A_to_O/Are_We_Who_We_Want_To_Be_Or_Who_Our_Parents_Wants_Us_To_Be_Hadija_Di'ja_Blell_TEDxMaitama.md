I came here as myself I don&#39;t have
anything else to show you but Who I am
and who I&#39;m thriving to become
insha&#39;Allah so as of this is what I&#39;m
known as hadiza deva blue but i&#39;m
currently hadiza Oulu formerly hadees&#39;
out there and popularly known as diva i
was very scared coming here to talk
because all I know how to do is sing I
don&#39;t really talk much I don&#39;t talk much
about myself I&#39;m sure most people that
have heard what I&#39;m doing mostly always
asking when did she do this one but I
can only tell you that I&#39;m here today to
talk about Who I am and who I was
thought out to be or become and who I&#39;m
currently becoming I grew up in Kaduna
cities yeah I come from a family of two
myself and my brother and I had a very
strict mother my mom is from Zarya born
in canoe so my mom is Hausa
and my dad is sorello nian I am
constantly searching for who I am
because I come from a place where we are
constantly defining somebody is telling
you who you are constantly it&#39;s not
necessarily that they&#39;re trying to do
this further they can put you down or
bring you down this is what we&#39;ve known
these are traditional these are
traditions these are cultures these are
things passed on from generations to
generations and it gets to a point where
it gets to our generation and I like
please know what ia telling me which one
is this one again today you know those
kind of things like we&#39;re constantly
moving back and forth with you know our
parents
and not even realizing that our mothers
and our fathers do have their own
stories that they probably keep away
from us so that we could think that life
is so rosy I wanted to first start from
where I started from
and this is somewhere in Java Road in
Kaduna State and to this today I don&#39;t
really believe that this is Who I am
today because I&#39;m constantly
metamorphosizing like I literally just
I&#39;ve had a baby about a year ago and it
has completely changed who I thought I
was and has made me appreciate who my
mother was trying to make me become one
of my ways of probably expressing myself
came out through music this is not
something that is very common where I
come from or where any most of us come
from we are seen as you know we have
certain roles we have certain images we
have certain kinds of ways we have to be
in order to be accepted in our society
and this isn&#39;t like I said I&#39;m not here
to tell you that these things are bad
that they&#39;ve told us because truthfully
there are things that I&#39;m learning now
that I&#39;m using now that I have my own
family and but music was always a way of
sort of escaping or saying the things
that I probably couldn&#39;t see in real
life and saying you know I&#39;m not talking
about myself I could be anybody else
this story it&#39;s not really about me you
know I was always finding ways to become
the person that everybody expected me to
be as I came up here I&#39;m sure that first
thing everybody expected me probably
wants to sing something I don&#39;t really
talk much but I decided I&#39;ll try talking
being diva hasn&#39;t been very easy not
because it can&#39;t but because I&#39;ve had
many many hats to wear I&#39;ve literally
had many people to please along the way
so as not to offend anybody this again
has nothing to do with trying to fight
the status quo or trying to say that
what we were taught is completely wrong
because it&#39;s not like I said these are
cultural traditions that now that we in
a different generation
you know maybe more people have more of
if I say guts to self-awareness or
self-worth or trying to express who they
are through things like pictures that&#39;s
why pictures is what I pick today
because this is how we see the world
today I mean the reason why I know this
is because many times I&#39;ve got in too
many arguments with calling somebody and
everything and I got a job but it&#39;s not
Posner happy but things change and this
is why Who I am
changes every time because the world is
changing and we&#39;re almost adapting to
every change that comes along the way
but still we owe it to our cultures and
our traditions to stay in a certain kind
of way so that we don&#39;t break boundaries
or we don&#39;t disrespect anyone I came
here to say first and foremost we are
sorry to our mothers and our fathers
because we do certain things most times
thinking we know better
most times we are learning but we have a
communication problem and a
communication breakdown and I learned
through this was because I started my
own family as well so again I said my
background started in Kaduna and I was
really raised by a very eccentric family
I mean I was raised with a Muslim
background my faith is Islam and I am
doing something totally outside of what
is quote unquote written for me but just
like I wanted to start this was with a
song called case there are Sarah which
is whatever would be would be regardless
of the circular part of where this song
comes from by you know relevance thing
even in our books even in our holy books
everything we want to believe that it is
written and what will be will be so I
used to always try to argue and say but
if if I&#39;m already like this and and and
you&#39;re not listening that means I&#39;m
supposed to be like this and you know
constantly my mom is arguing fighting
with me and telling me you should be you
should you know you should you should
know answer me back and these are things
that she&#39;s doing not because she was
trying to put me down but now that I
mean where I&#39;m living this life that I
have quote unquote chose for myself
I&#39;m seeing with some of these lessons
make sense you don&#39;t always talk really
fast because you can you know shoot
yourself in the foot so you have to keep
quiet first and listen to all the facts
on all the before you start arguing and
start talking a lot of times we want to
be heard but we don&#39;t want to listen and
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned along the way
is I&#39;m fighting to be Who I am
forgetting that Who I am is parts of
each and every one of you because my
experiences and the way I act and the
way I&#39;m defined is how I how I react to
you you know I might come to you today
and I have an attitude problem and you
know people say first impressions that&#39;s
why I no longer judge people based on
first impressions because man life has a
way of dealing with you something so you
can meet somebody on a very bad day so I
used to believe that first impressions
matter and that was who I was but
because of I&#39;ve grown and I&#39;ve reached
the certain stages in my life I realized
that sometimes first impressions really
don&#39;t matter they told me this was about
talking about who I was and who my
parents wanted it to be but truth of the
matter is they do intertwine you really
can&#39;t be who you are without who your
parents already were trying to make you
you know to be or whoever your guardian
who you grew around because you imitate
everything these people do up until you
reach a certain stage you know I hear a
lot of I&#39;m self-made and I did this by
myself
and I try to remind people that we
didn&#39;t really do anything ourselves
nothing because I don&#39;t think you have
any memory between now and five years
old as to how you got there first of all
you know and so it&#39;s it&#39;s now that I&#39;m
starting to appreciate each and every
moment in my life you know having roles
signed up for me already as being I keep
telling people I said growing up in
Africa is it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s it&#39;s really
not a disability it&#39;s not anything you
know it&#39;s not a third world country heck
I think we&#39;re first world everybody&#39;s
taking everything from here and building
everything else so for me it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
a foundation that&#39;s needed but it does
come with these challenges because we
have traditions and we have cultures and
within those cultures we&#39;re now
quote-unquote or people call the
Millennials and we&#39;re supposed to try to
still fit within those cultures and
what-what wasn&#39;t even explained to us
properly so I&#39;m trying to make do with
everything that I have and the most I
think as another whole is to just have
respect and kindness and that&#39;s usually
how I think I go about my day my
background does have a lot to do with my
family obviously this is the most
important part of my life this is the
most even though I fought them for a
long time even though I used to think
that oh you know it&#39;s not so bad to sing
but I never really understood because
truthfully people that you know we&#39;re
doing this kind of profession was seen
as other you know not really part of the
society this is no way you&#39;re supposed
to be doing you are a female you are an
African you are a Muslim and you&#39;re
acting like you don&#39;t even know who you
are what you are and I used to always
say well Who I am is a reflection of my
experiences and everything that I&#39;m
trying to understand but I can&#39;t
understand if you keep yelling at me I
can&#39;t understand this if you keep
telling me that everything I do is wrong
I can&#39;t and won&#39;t understand it because
humanly the way we are made up and put
together is that we are trying to
survive and as soon as somebody tries to
attack you you almost either you run
into your shell or you start doing all
the bad things to just create attention
so I always feel feel that it&#39;s not
necessarily that you know there&#39;s a
breakdown between different generations
is more or less of how we are given the
information it doesn&#39;t really take more
than three to four seconds to sit down
there are certain conversations I could
never I would never bring up with my
mother a long time ago that everybody&#39;s
expecting me to be comfortable to talk
about now I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not
trained to have these conversations I&#39;m
not trained to speak about these things
neither am i but nobody ever told me not
to think about it so that&#39;s why I ended
up finding ways to get the message out
there but it doesn&#39;t always have to be
talking
about me these are the most important
people in my life my mother and my
father and they came from two separate
cultures and met in Kaduna and I keep
telling someone that I&#39;m a combination
of all these things and it&#39;s very hard
to completely disregard one side or
completely disregard the other side
because I&#39;m not necessarily pleasing you
I feel instead of trying to understand
one another we&#39;re trying to figure out
how is the best way to keep an amazing
face to look the best part to not say
the wrong things but by not saying those
things we don&#39;t know whether they are
wrong or they&#39;re right we don&#39;t really
know when and how to use them and when
we use them other times that we don&#39;t
necessarily mean that this is what we&#39;re
trying to say it becomes a fight and
then there&#39;s no longer communication at
all and then it becomes disrespect and
then it becomes I can&#39;t you cannot even
talk to me I cannot and you know it
becomes I find that sometimes we as
youth as well
don&#39;t really give our parents enough
chance because you have to remember that
every generation just gets more aware
it&#39;s not necessarily that they&#39;re coming
with old ways it&#39;s just every single
generation gets more and more aware and
now it&#39;s even scarier because we&#39;re in
the generation that&#39;s becoming another
generation and you&#39;re like wait I
thought you&#39;re supposed to age to get
here and then you know people at 21 and
25 are killing each other because they
can&#39;t make their first million because
everybody else is making that so I keep
saying that who I&#39;m Who I am is not
necessarily who I was told I was going
to become this is every time I meet you
I change I hear this every time people
say you&#39;ve changed you&#39;re constantly
changing
you&#39;ve changed because you&#39;re now in
music you&#39;ve changed but I can&#39;t remain
the same because the people I meet are
not the same the people I see the people
are like now my pigeon is better than
CSI daylight is not they can&#39;t play I
know your problem seriously living in
Lake
you have had to adapt I&#39;ve had to meet
so many different people and I&#39;ve had to
also put some of my own boundaries aside
in order to open up to these people
because with my boundaries I don&#39;t share
anything with them with my boundaries I
sit and say you&#39;re different from me so
why do i what do I have to tell you what
do you want to hear but you try even
even you know based on on religion and
based on what we&#39;ve learned they say you
know you try different ways if you don&#39;t
if it doesn&#39;t work this way you sit down
if it doesn&#39;t you stand up if not in
light and if you know you&#39;ve tried all
those ways then you move on but I feel
we give up too quickly
nowadays figuring out who we are because
we don&#39;t have enough patience we don&#39;t
have enough time everything is on the go
everything is fast fast and people
always ask me how is it that you can be
a moment a still a musician and a suit
you know this is I&#39;m like dude do you
know how many hundreds of millions of
women have done this before me countless
times there&#39;s nothing special about
anything that I&#39;m doing so I didn&#39;t come
here to tell anybody what I&#39;m doing is
so special it&#39;s just what it is I&#39;ve
chosen to do in order to figure out what
life is about and they comes a time
where you may never do it again there
comes a time where things change and
things become you know you&#39;re more aware
than you were the last time and things
you thought were so serious and if I
didn&#39;t do it out the eye you&#39;re just
like you know I&#39;m moving on to the next
thing and this is this comes with growth
this comes with probably I&#39;m sure many
mothers will tell you every child you
have you kind of lose a part of yourself
and you put everything into them because
it&#39;s not like our parents they don&#39;t
have dreams or aspirations or different
things that they wanted to do it&#39;s just
that as humans we make sacrifices and it
is within these sacrifices we discover
what it is we can or cannot do or can
handle or cannot handle you know my dad
being Sarah l&#39;union and my mom being
from Zarya it was never difficult it was
other people that made it difficult or
people asked me I I need no confused or
or is it that which one are you or which
one I&#39;m like I never really had to
choose I&#39;m kind of everything that
they&#39;ve made me so I never had to choose
I found it was always the world trying
to make me choose trying to make me
say you know the things that maybe they
are too scared to say I find that and
and it just it just made it a lot easier
I guess later on to sort of look in
hindsight and say okay I guess this is
what I was supposed to learn from this
truthfully I never in my life thought I
would think I never woke up in the
morning so this is what I wanted to I
want to make my parents upset or I just
want to show I&#39;m a rebel
that&#39;s not what I did I just followed
what it was I thought I was following
and they led me up to here
weather is good weather is bad I pray
every day that I&#39;m guided and and you
know constantly shown what it is that I
will appear in however many years from
here but until then you know this is
where I&#39;m at and I&#39;m still trying to
figure it out you know I came from a
place where you know I was told that
almost if you touch somebody like this
you could get pregnant you know it&#39;s you
just don&#39;t even try and go anywhere you
know you can&#39;t talk from a distance and
things like that and you know this this
for me was always okay well if I watch
houses I mean I wants to come and be
making me feel any any kind of way
there&#39;s really nothing attractive out of
a pair of trousers and it&#39;s talk because
it was almost like a god I always felt
if I had your dress and wore trousers
underneath you&#39;re like I&#39;m okay nothing
can happen to me at this point you know
you grow up feeling that you don&#39;t
really have people around you what you
do you have people around you being a
woman being northern being Nigerian
being Sri Leone and being African it
doesn&#39;t really stop you from having
respect and kindness and you know having
a story that at some place at some times
somebody will listen to it somebody will
hear it I mean talking is not
necessarily one of my best traits so I
draw and this is something that I don&#39;t
really talk or show at all I draw the
eyes a lot and one of the reasons I draw
the eyes a lot because that&#39;s like they
say the window to the soul and most
likely I&#39;m trying to see something
within myself that I can&#39;t see quite yet
I do all this with pen by row I wish I
knew how to use pencil this is one of
the first drawings I ever did out of
frustration
I was quite angry and I had a fight
until today I don&#39;t know how I stood
there for four hours and I didn&#39;t take
the pan off and the first thing was I
said I loved my fans and this was back
in 2009
knowing that deep down inside everything
everybody told me that I was not going
to do I will try I will try and I will
do it consistently and I would do it
every day and I will pray over it and if
for some reason this is not good then by
God let it stop you know and this is
where we are today and this is where I&#39;m
still continuing to pray this is a very
big part of my life I&#39;m constantly
learning constantly trying to grow
within it I&#39;m sure by many different
standards the right things you&#39;re doing
the wrong things you&#39;re doing and you&#39;re
hoping that eventually like they say
earlier Sharia muta you know and I find
that these days we&#39;re getting more and
more afraid to show what it is or who
yeah and and you know faith because it&#39;s
almost becoming some form of a bad word
and I&#39;m very proud and very proud to be
a Muslim and I&#39;m very proud to be here
and this has nothing to do with being
tribalistic or being it is just who I am
and I don&#39;t want to have to be making
excuses for it over and over again
because of a certain group of people or
a certain news that&#39;s going around there
I mean we should all be able to openly
discuss who we are regardless of how
offensive it is as long as we can
actually keep an open communication you
learn something we don&#39;t have to admit
it right there and then that we learn
something we can always miss it to each
other you know and I&#39;ve had some moments
obviously I&#39;ll see some moments of my
mom cause moments of craziness and when
I use Ankara
to make braids because I&#39;m finding
different ways to cover my hair up or
finding different ways to show that you
can express different things and nets on
my face this not necessarily what people
should be doing it&#39;s what I do to
express what&#39;s inside of me I remember
one day like that uh-huh
me and Mama had a little chat uh-huh on
how to laughs I sat haha but only one
question meows mama
what is it that they want anyways what
is it so hard to be a woman which way is
right anyways I&#39;m surrounded by you and
I want you to help me thank you very
much
