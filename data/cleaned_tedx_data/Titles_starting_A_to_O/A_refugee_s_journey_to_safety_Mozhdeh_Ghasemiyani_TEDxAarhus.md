imagine a little girl she&#39;s only four
years old she&#39;s scared she&#39;s crying
and she is in a little village high up
in the mountains of Kurdistan in Iraq
she&#39;s screaming she&#39;s shouting but
nobody&#39;s hearing her voice she&#39;s
desperately holding onto her mother&#39;s
dress her mother&#39;s bleeding half of her
face is missing and the sound of
gunshots it&#39;s still echoing in the
little girl&#39;s ears these images these
sounds the deep feeling of fear will be
forever frozen in my memory I&#39;m sure
that all of you feel a great deal of
sympathy for this little girl you might
even think of your own son daughter
nieces and nephews but at the same time
you might feel a sense of helplessness
what can I do this happened in a country
far away from here I&#39;m here today to
tell you that you have the key to help
this little girl and thousands of little
girls and boys just like her I know that
because I was this little girl
who suffered from trauma and fear
throughout her childhood but she was
lucky to get it to get through it
because of the health of people like you
I also know that because I have been
working tirelessly for the past twelve
years as a psychologist to find out how
I can relieve traumatized refugees from
their trauma and from their fear and to
help them to have a productive and happy
life when my mother got shot I learned
that no matter how much I shouted how
much I screamed I didn&#39;t have a voice as
a child and I learned that the world was
not safe my story begins the same way as
the story of millions of refugee
children all over the world it begins
with a war my name is Mazda it means
good news yes I was given that name by
my Kurdish parents because they were
certain that my name came with the good
news of peace and democracy for the
Kurdish people and because I was born
the exact same day that the revolution
ended in Iran in 1979 but they were
wrong only six months after my birth I
ended up in prison with my mother and
after that 13 years refugees in Iraq as
refugees we didn&#39;t have any rights we
experienced oppression cruelty and death
I will spare you the details but I can
tell you that they were experiences that
nobody should be exposed to not a child
or an adult I learned the same thing
that many refugee children end up
learning at some point in their life and
that is my family and I were unwanted by
the people around us
we&#39;re simply and wanted I also learned
that the people that I loved and the
people that I cared about they just
disappeared
I remember my little brother crying and
shouting and being really angry every
time my dad would leave the house
because he knew the exact same thing
that we all knew that every time we said
goodbye to somebody there was a huge
risk that we will never see them again
I knew the same so I would hold on to my
little brother&#39;s hand firmly and I will
pull him close to me hoping that I would
never lose him like millions of refugee
children
I grew up never knowing what it meant to
feel safe fear consumed all of my being
I was afraid every second of my life
today we know that constant fear has
psychological damaging effect on
children almost 40 to 50 percent of
traumatized refugees end up developing
post-traumatic stress disorder for many
years after my mother got shot I could
not sleep I had nightmares all the time
I could not learn anything because I
couldn&#39;t concentrate I couldn&#39;t remember
I would faint if I saw blood I would
faint if I saw somebody angry or if I
saw a soldier my immune system was
damaged by stress so I would get
infections all the time yet I consider
myself lucky my family was lucky because
we were able to get out of the war zone
thanks to the UN system of quota
refugees and thanks to Denmark for
accepting us
but my struggles as refugees did not
intend even after I came to Denmark I
realized that my trauma and my fear did
not disappear while I wasn&#39;t in a war
zone anymore and the bombs had stopped
falling and the bullet had stopped
raining over me every day and night I
was still afraid during the night I
would be back in the war fighting for my
life in my nightmares in the day&#39;s
smells and sounds would take me back to
the war again and again you probably
remember my little brother that I told
you about that could not say goodbye and
got really angry every time my dad left
the house he&#39;s grown out now he lives
close to me he&#39;s actually sitting in the
audience today but still he&#39;s unable to
say goodbye every time he visits me it
takes him 30 minutes to say goodbye and
get out of the house and when he gets to
his car finally he calls me right away
to tell me that he will see me again
soon and he calls me again when he&#39;s
home he calls me again right before he
goes to sleep my story is not unique
and fortunately you probably heard of
the million of refugees all over the
world today according to United Nation
there is more than 65 million refugees
right now today this is equivalent to
the big country like UK or France these
numbers are overwhelming that difficult
to relate to I know they are for me too
even though it seems impossible
to do anything about these millions just
affecting the life of one person for the
better is a signal great significant and
every and each of these numbers
represent a human fate like myself my
brother and the refugees that I work
with so the challenge is how do we
ensure that refugees many of which are
traumatized can have a good productive
life for their own benefits but also for
the benefit of the society and the
economy as a whole in my work as a
psychologist I have found out that even
though it is essential working on
processing the traumatic experience it&#39;s
not enough in itself because the
refugees I work with every time they
experience a huge amount of stress or
transition their trauma reaction will
come back so I start asking them one
simple question
what is the difference between the times
that you feeling well and the times that
you&#39;re not and their answers were always
the same fear especially the children
would tell me that they felt afraid
everywhere and every second of their
lives and the only place they wanted to
be was with their families because that
was the only place they felt safe and
the importance of safety is also backed
by academic research the theory and the
research of professor Jennifer Allman
tell us and show us that we were born
with a core assumption that we&#39;re safe
in the world that gives us the ability
to go out and live freely and when that
ability is shattered because of a
traumatic
experience we&#39;re no longer able to trust
people around us we&#39;re no longer able to
trust ourselves
so if traumatized refugees need to heal
or we help them to heal they need to
trust again
and in order to trust they need to feel
safe again and the process of regaining
safety the feeling of safety is not
achieved only through psychological
therapy it is achieved through being
with other people in communities where
you feel safe and that is also shown by
a study done by Edith Montgomery who
followed 450 children refugee children
arriving as asylum seekers in Denmark
the study shows that almost 90% of the
children when they arrived in Denmark
they had trauma reactions but the
children who got asylum and who were
moved to a very safe community
shortly after their trauma reaction
actually disappeared they recovered so
safety and community matters today I
have learned that as a psychologist if I
want to help traumatize refugees heal
and also have a productive life and be
integrated in their societies I need the
help of the communities around them and
the question is is that a difficult
thing to do to give that help to give
that help and the answer is no is
actually very simple every and each one
of you can change life I will give you
some illustrations when I came to
Denmark and what gave my family and I
hope back and the feeling that we were
normal human beings like everybody else
was the kindness of one man that man&#39;s
name is voluma he was 70 years old at
the time we&#39;re living in a small village
and in all the years that we lived there
none of our neighbors ever knocked our
door to ask us how we&#39;re doing or to say
hello and one day Valdemar just showed
up he talked and talked
in Danish we didn&#39;t understand anything
of what he said
still we welcomed him and we sat down
with drank tea Volta my stars watching
the Kurdish news with my father and then
he decided that he would like to teach
us Danish and we start having something
to look forward to every day
vadoma made us feel welcome he made us
feel normal and most of all he made us
feel safe when I was working in London
few years ago with torture survivors I
met this young adult his name is Jonas
and yonas at the time he didn&#39;t have
asylum he was living on the streets he
was suffering from depression suicide
thoughts and post-traumatic stress
disorder and one day I went for a walk
with yonas and every time we met a
friendly person who would smile to him
he would stop up and he would ask if you
could take a picture with them the same
way as he took a picture with me after
every session we had so one day I asked
him why is he taking so many pictures of
everybody and the answer was very simple
he looked at me he smiled and said well
it&#39;s really scary at the dark in the
evenings when I&#39;m lying in the streets
that&#39;s the time where I have suicide
thoughts and I don&#39;t want to be here
anymore
I get scared when did that happen I
simply take out my phone and I look at
all the friendly faces that I have seen
that day and I remind myself that the
world is not that bad maybe it&#39;s not
that scary and I started looking forward
to tomorrow
what Velma and yonas taught me is very
simple
but at the same time very powerful he
taught me that it&#39;s me and you
who got the power to give back refugees
what has been shattered within them it&#39;s
us together who can give back these
people the feeling of safety and it&#39;s
very simple every every kindness
actually counts
you just have to treat them as you treat
any other human beings be kind be
curious talk to them smile when I was 16
I fled Iraq with my family in a bag of a
truck I remember looking out and
thinking of thousands of refugee
children I have left behind and I
remember at that moment making myself a
promise that one day I will find my
voice one day I will be able to tell all
the stories of our Fujii child I will be
the last voice of the children of the
war and today I stand in front of you no
longer frozen
thank you
today I stand in front of you while my
trauma is still part of me I&#39;m low no
longer frozen I&#39;m no longer overwhelmed
by fear at the same time I know I&#39;m
standing here because I was given a
chance a chance that millions of refugee
children is not given today I was given
asylum and I was met by people who was
kind and gave me back the faith in
humanity being a refugee is not a choice
but welcoming them and being kind to
them is a choice that every one of us
can make every day I remember my mother
always telling us that refugees look for
angels in their journey and these angels
would change our life by their simple
gesture of kindness and we make a place
in your heart for these angels and
remember them for always and my wish
today is for all of you that you will go
out and be an angel for the next refugee
that you meet my wish today is that you
actually will go out and be someone&#39;s
Valderrama thank you so much thank you
