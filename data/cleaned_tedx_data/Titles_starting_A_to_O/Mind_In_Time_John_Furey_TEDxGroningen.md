that guy seemed like he was in a bit of
a hurry hmm time I would want to talk to
you about time it&#39;s an extraordinary
thing far more extraordinary than we can
really ever imagine but let me start at
the beginning
23 years ago I had an extraordinary
moment of insight that completely
changed my life I&#39;d like to share it
with you what I suddenly understood was
why and how we seem to be so very
different from each other and how it is
that these differences are at the root
of so many of our misunderstandings
these differences are reflected in how
we communicate with each other in the
words that we use they are a part of our
choices that we make our preferences
there are the root of how we work and
how we engage with people I don&#39;t know
about you but when I was growing up I
was always being told to use my head to
think before I spoke now you might think
I&#39;m about to start talking about
personality I&#39;m not what I&#39;d like to do
is to share with you how it is that I
believe that we think because these are
thinking that is at the root of our
differences not our personalities our
personalities now behaviors are the
products of our thinking decart wrote I
think therefore I am
personality is like this shiny gift
wrapping that we wrap around and it
hides the true gift our thinking now I
don&#39;t know about you but I keep
wondering how it is that we can send a
spacecraft with extraordinary accuracy
eight billion kilometres to Saturn and
we can dive to the deepest depths of our
oceans
and yet we still do not understand how
it is that we are different from each
other and how it is that we can use
these differences to be a more effective
in the world to collaborate more
effectively in my mid-20s like so many
young people do I started reading books
on psychology I was trying to understand
myself and I quickly learned that we are
taught in the West to understand
ourselves other people and our world
around us by the differences between
things in fact the science of
personality in the science of psychology
is for the most part a study of
individual differences and how each of
us is different from some so-called
established norm but I would put it to
you that with this point of view that
we&#39;ve developed without some overarching
principle some framework that gives us
some sense of how we belong without a
theory that actually unifies us where we
can understand what these differences
are about and how it is that we can use
them to help each other that we are left
well alone we&#39;re left feeling different
we&#39;re left in a place where we&#39;re I
selected from each other in our thoughts
my insight was that all of these
different points of view
all of these differences that we
supposedly have are all actually aspects
of one thing and that is time past
present and future one unifying
phenomena that gives rise to all of our
thinking and within which actually we
all play
this idea this insight was not new
I found out in fact it is actually at
the root of some of the greatest
teachings in both the Western and
Eastern cultures I probably picked it up
somewhere along the way but at the
moment that I got this 23 years ago I
grasped absolutely the significance and
the implications of what this truly
meant so this is my take on that
ancient wisdom maybe it&#39;s a version for
our modern times each of our brains is
wired differently but all of them all of
them are motivated by three simple
priorities certainty probability and
possibility certainty is what we get
from the past it is the only thing that
we can be certain of we have shared
experiences we learn we look we measure
we establish ideas it is from the past
that we create some sense of security of
what is and how it works without that
security we would be lost we would be
literally locked in fear like animals
constantly awake and we have possibility
that comes to us from the future
the very word possible seems infinite
and it&#39;s to the future we look for our
solutions to problems we look here to
get new ideas and to combine all one&#39;s
to create new solutions it&#39;s from the
future that we get hope hope to try hope
to overcome what is to become something
better in the future
and it is the present where we take
action it is the only place that we can
actually have an effect on our lives and
in this present we plan for the future
we structure we organize we create
processes rules norms regulations all of
these servers to create community
harmony stability balance because
without stability there is nothing that
we can do we are lost
just as we are lost without certainty
and we are lost without hope now what is
amazing is that every single person in
the world uses past present and future
certainty probability and possibility in
their force we blend these three
different perspectives of time in order
to create our perceptions some people
have an equal measure of all three some
people blend two and have less of the
third and others still have only one of
these in dominance and the other two
much less now I am a future thinker I
use a lot of future thinking in my
thinking I don&#39;t have a lot of access to
the present or past dimensions so when I
had my insight and I wanted to do
something with it
I knew I had to turn to past thinking
the scientists the experts the
psychologist to help them help me
understand what it is I had found out it
wasn&#39;t easy
from my perspective they took my great
big shiny beautiful insight and they
reduced it down to a series of
experiments they took it to pieces and
not only did they take it to pieces but
they wanted to fit it in to their
existing taxonomy x&#39; their existing
structures their existing language it
was horrible
and then I dealt with the present think
is because in order to actually make
this work I actually had to go to them
and say how can I apply it and once
again this wasn&#39;t easy because what they
did is they took this idea of mine and
all they wanted to do was to apply it to
one specific or another specific problem
it felt so a lien and yet over time
using this very insight we managed to
learn how to work together we managed to
learn how to deeply respect each other&#39;s
differences right here on this stage
we&#39;ve been hearing amazing ideas and I
put it to you that if we could
understand our differences we can
understand how we think then we could
actually change the way that we work in
the world we could actually change the
way we take these ideas from the Ted
talks around the world and we could do
something more material more
collaborative with them I&#39;m reminded of
an old saying it&#39;s a very powerful
saying that&#39;s been used many times
before most recently was in Margaret
Thatcher&#39;s memoir film Iron Lady but in
that particular case it was used as an
admonishment a warning and I don&#39;t think
that was the original intention this
originally came from about two and a
half thousand years ago it&#39;s the oldest
reference I can find from Gautama Buddha
and I&#39;m going to paraphrase it because I
want to hold that original intention
watch your thoughts for your thoughts
will become your words and what she&#39;ll
worse because they will shape your
actual behavior and what&#39;s your behavior
because that behavior will become your
character and then observe that
character because it is creating your
destiny if we could adjust agree on this
one thing that it is to our thinking
that we must look to better understand
ourselves in each other we would be so
much more understanding so much more
compassionate so much more collaborative
in the world I believe that everybody
here has value to bring and it is
through our thinking that we do that
thank you
