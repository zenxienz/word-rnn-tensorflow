it&#39;s just so overwhelming the memories
keep flooding back the booze doesn&#39;t
help anymore my whole life has been torn
apart let&#39;s imagine Mary for a moment
from a very young age
Mary witnessed her father physically
abusing her mother on numerous occasions
he would come home drunk start arguments
start pushing and shoving start punching
and kicking Mary remembers running to
hide at these times she was so terrified
so scared and so helpless I should have
done something to help she says I should
have helped my mum during her teens Mary
moved out of home and things got a
little better for her she met a nice guy
and they soon moved in together she says
at the time she started drinking a bit
of alcohol and smoking pot just to
socialize or relax with friends but it
was never a problem for her then she
says at some point her partner&#39;s
behavior became quite controlling and
this controlling behavior soon turned
abusive so for a period of up to three
years Mary was physically mentally and
sexually abused by this person mary has
difficulty recalling these these events
because she says she starts to drink
quite heavily then and and smokes a lot
of pot in order to cope with the
situation she does remember however
being able to escape this destructive
relationship she moves out of the area
and starts a new life elsewhere she
seeks some help for her alcohol and her
drug use and manages to cut down on and
off for a number of years she also meets
the man who was to become her husband
and has two children with him Mary
doesn&#39;t know how or why but in the past
year she started getting really vivid
flashbacks of what she&#39;d witnessed as a
child and what she&#39;d experienced as a
teenager she also has difficulty
sleeping has nightmares every night and
has really intense physiological
reactions when she&#39;s reminded of the
trauma so when someone sneaks up behind
her or when she&#39;s watching TV
she can start to shake and
uncontrollably she also describes
feelings of shame and guilt associated
with the trauma and as a result is
drinking a lot drinking up to a bottle
of vodka a day and this has had a
significant impact on her life and in
particular an impact on her husband and
children to put it simply Mary was at
her worst when she came to us for help
I&#39;ll come back to Mary in a moment now
this story may resonate quite strongly
with some of you here tonight and it may
have even brought up some difficult or
uncomfortable emotions for you it may
relate directly to you or directly to
someone you know
now this isn&#39;t surprising given how
common trauma is traumas like sexual
abuse physical abuse natural disasters
or motor vehicle accidents are all a lot
more common than we think
in fact it&#39;s highly likely that the
person sitting next to you at work or
sitting next to you on a bus or or
standing next to you in in a queue at a
shopping center has experienced traumas
just like these during their childhood
or adolescence child and adolescent
trauma has been described as an epidemic
a hidden epidemic but I come here
tonight with some good news in line with
tonight&#39;s theme we now have the
knowledge to address the hidden epidemic
of trauma with compassion we can make
sure that this knowledge is accessible
to the people who need it
it&#39;s stories just like Mary&#39;s that I&#39;ve
heard from over a hundred men and women
seeking treatment for alcohol or drug
use problems
I&#39;ve been overwhelmingly moved and
privileged to hear such deeply personal
stories stories that people have secrets
that people have held onto so tightly
for so many years for most people who
experience trauma they do recover after
some months however for others trauma
can have a lifelong debilitating impact
on their lives
and impetus
Keela if the trauma is experienced
during younger years my research has
shown that for people who experience
trauma before the age of 17 they&#39;re up
to four times more likely to experience
mental health disorders later in life
mental health disorders like depression
anxiety and post-traumatic stress
disorder in order to cope with really
intrusive and distressing and painful
thoughts and feelings
many people use alcohol or use drugs in
order to medicate or numb these feelings
the problem with this that is that like
Mary they can then develop an alcohol or
drug use disorder in addition to their
mental health disorder and with that
comes a whole new raft of challenges and
difficulties for the individual but as I
said we now have the knowledge we now
know what works in the treatment of
co-occurring mental health disorders and
drug and alcohol use disorders and
that&#39;s integrated treatment
traditionally what we&#39;ve done is not
treat the individual as a whole
basically we&#39;ve asked them to cut down
or quit their drug or alcohol use and
then after some time expect them to seek
help for their mental health symptoms
elsewhere this separate siloed treatment
approach really isn&#39;t working as
effectively as it could be and in fact
we now know that in many cases the
integrated treatment approach is much
more effective so that&#39;s treating the
mental health disorder and the substance
use disorder at the same time by the
same clinician I mean it&#39;s simple isn&#39;t
it it really shouldn&#39;t be that
groundbreaking but it has been and at
the moment there&#39;s a huge shift to this
integrated treatment model
internationally so we now have this
knowledge we now know that integrated
treatment works but this isn&#39;t an issue
that science alone can solve there&#39;s
still a missing piece to this puzzle and
that piece is compassion many people
don&#39;t ask for help and many people don&#39;t
seek treatment in fact we know that only
one in three Australians living with
alcohol use disorder ever seek treatment
so only
one in three and among those that do it
can take up to two decades before they
first ask for help
why is that when I&#39;ve asked that
question people have told me that it&#39;s
because they feel ashamed it&#39;s because
they don&#39;t feel worthy of help they
don&#39;t feel they deserve help and they
worry about being judged and sadly this
is reflected by many views in society
and so this is where compassion can play
a key role a key role in encouraging
people to ask for help of course
it can be difficult to care for someone
if you don&#39;t know their story or if you
don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re in the
situation that they&#39;re in but think back
to how you felt when I told you about
Mary&#39;s story and in particular when I
told you about Mary as a child
vulnerable scared and blaming herself
it&#39;s those feelings that I&#39;m talking
about tapping into those kinds of
feelings when we see someone in need
someone distressed someone worthy of her
of help and it&#39;s as simple as that just
building that human connection imagine
how powerful that could have been for
Mary if she sensed that someone
understood her or if she felt that
someone thought she was worthy of help I
believe she would have sought treatment
much much sooner if we all can work
together to build a higher level of
compassion many more people will ask for
help and many more people will access
these effective integrated treatments I
believe only then can we truly address
the hidden epidemic of child and
adolescent trauma thank you
you
