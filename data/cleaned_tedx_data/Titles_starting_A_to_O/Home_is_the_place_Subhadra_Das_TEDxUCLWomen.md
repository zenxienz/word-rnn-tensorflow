[Music]
so I am at a piano bar at my friend
Lauren&#39;s hen do in Islington and I am
talking to my friend Ann who is Canadian
in fact I&#39;m having to bellow at Ann to
make myself heard above the piano music
when a guy comes up to me and says hey
where are you from now it&#39;s getting on
for midnight I have been drinking since
- I have no time for this so I say it&#39;s
a long story and I walk away on my way
out I bump into the same guy again and
once again he comes up and he says to me
hey no you really I get the impression
he wasn&#39;t entirely sober either really
where are you from I heard your accent
and I&#39;m really curious now this is
interesting I&#39;m what&#39;s called a third
culture kid which is someone who is
raised in the culture that is different
from that of their parents I was born in
Abu Dhabi which is the capital of the
United Arab Emirates and my parents were
Indian Bengalis so I was brought up
Hindu in a Muslim country and I spoke
Bangla at home and English at school my
parents insisted that I get the best
education possible and for them that
meant sending me to an English school so
when I left there at the age of 11 I
sounded like the kids out of the famous
5 I then transferred to an American
International School and by the time I
graduated high school I sounded like the
kids out of Dawson&#39;s Creek
I came to London to study at University
College London UCL when I was 18 and
I&#39;ve been here for 18 years so I&#39;ve come
back to mostly sounding English but my
accent can travel back and forth across
the Atlantic depending on who I&#39;m
speaking to
now at this point the guy in the piano
bar got bored and wandered off but I was
approaching an epiphany so I kept going
if I came to UCL when I was 18 and I&#39;ve
been there 18 years UCL is the place I
have been that most consistently for the
whole of my adult life I&#39;ve been a
member of staff as well as a student so
UCL is home now when I was first asked
to do this talk and they told me that
the topic was home a line of poetry came
into my head you all know from earlier I
kind of liked poetry the line was home
is the place that when you go there they
have to take you in now that&#39;s a line
from a poem by Robert Frost which is
called death of a hired man you&#39;re
welcome to read it bearing in mind that
it is exactly as depressing as it sounds
but for some reason that line had stuck
in my head for all of that time and I
think it&#39;s got something to do with the
fact that the whole of my life I have
struggled to feel like I belong anywhere
home is the place that when you go there
they have to take you in so if UCL is
the place I&#39;ve been up the longest if
UCL is home did they take me in and the
answer is not entirely and for the rest
of this talk I&#39;m going to tell you why I
work in a department called UCL culture
and I am a museum curator I curate the
medical and science collections and one
of those is a thing called the golden
collection it&#39;s named for Sir Francis
Galton 1822 - 19
than just to get an impression I can
just about see most of you just by a
show of hands if you just raise your
hand in the air who in this room has
heard of Francis Galton I&#39;m seeing a few
I&#39;m also seeing that most the people
that I invited here are the ones putting
their hands up okay so not that many
people in this room now
that doesn&#39;t surprise me at all because
until I started working with the
collection I had never heard of Francis
Galton and the more I found out about
him and how influential it turns out he
is a funny thing kept happening or
really the same thing kept happening
over and over again which is that I
would find out something and I would go
I never knew that I guess they can&#39;t
teach you everything I&#39;ll give you some
examples golfin first became famous as
an African Explorer he wrote a book in
1855 which is called the art of travel
and it&#39;s still in print you can still
buy it and this book was so successful
that it turned him into the Bear Grylls
of Victorian London so if you went back
in time to London 1855 said the name
Francis Galton they&#39;d be like ah the
African Explorer now if I say the word
African Explorer to you you get a
picture in your head which I&#39;m going to
assume is ironically enough a white man
in a white suit wearing a pith helmet in
a jungle looking off into the middle
distance with a look in his eye that
says all of this is mine
and that picture that you get in your
head that&#39;s Colton and when I found that
out I thought I never knew that I guess
they can&#39;t teach you everything another
example
Golson was the first person in Britain
to publish a weather map so what he did
was he took data from lots of different
places all around Europe and he was the
first person to draw lines between
places of equal barometric pressure
equal temperature so when you watch the
weather forecast this morning and saw
that it was a beautiful day and the
ideal time to come and secrete yourself
into a very dark room and listen to
people speak that&#39;s down to golden so
again found that out and thought well
didn&#39;t know that I guess they can teach
you everything one final example golden
is the first person to demonstrate that
the odds of two people having the same
fingerprints is one in 64 billion now
that doesn&#39;t stand in quite the same way
that it used to crime science is
developing all the time it&#39;s not an
exact science but that fundamental
contribution that he made is the basis
of our modern criminal identification
system we send people to jail on the
strength of fingerprint evidence now I
never knew the golden was responsible
for that particular innovation in
science but I guess they can&#39;t teach you
everything all of that being said the
thing that Golson is really famous for
or it turns out not even a little bit
famous at all is the branch of science
that we call by the name that he came up
with for it which is eugenics eugenics
is the idea that through government
intervention and scientific research
it&#39;s possible to breed better people
Goldson that idea and the idea that
science was what was going to help us
obtain that goal
is his unique and genius contribution to
the wealth of Western knowledge now he
believed that the way to find out who
are the people who should be encouraged
to have children pass on their positive
traits and improved the human race as we
go on the way to find out who those
people were was to measure them and so
to that end in 1884 at the International
Health exhibition in London he set up
what he called his anthropometric
laboratory and throw meaning people
metric to measure in the first year that
it was open nearly 10,000 people came to
have their pedigree recorded and
measurements of their physical features
and abilities taken over the next 20
years so many people came that it wasn&#39;t
until the 1960s that there was a
computer that was capable of handling
that quantity of data now at this point
I expect you&#39;re wondering what&#39;s all
this got to do with UCL what&#39;s it got to
do with how I feel at home there the
answer is what happened in 1904 in 1904
golden wrote to the principal of UCL
University College as it was then and
said the work being done by the
anthropometric laboratory this eugenic
research is important scientific
research
it needs the backing of an academic
institution if it&#39;s going to be taken
seriously the Senate of UCL jumped at
the chance they replied within a week
and within a few months were set up the
eugenics Records office at number 50
Gower Street as part of University
College within three years it moved
slightly closer to the main building up
the road at number 88 to our Street and
it was inaugurated as the golden
laboratory for national eugenics at UCL
eugenics at its heart is a scientific
way of making a decision about who gets
to live and who gets to die and like all
of the other biological and social
sciences
from the 19th century coming into the
20th century the idea the scientific
idea of race was fundamental to eugenics
now I spend quite a lot of my working
life telling people this story both
students within the university and
speaking to the public and oftentimes
someone will come up to me and say this
stuff is awful your job must be so hard
and they&#39;re right but not quite in the
way that they think they are my job
isn&#39;t difficult because of what I have
to talk about it&#39;s difficult because of
who I have to talk to this story that
I&#39;ve just told you and so much else
about the history of scientific racism
in the 19th and 20th centuries these
stories are not canon we don&#39;t get to
hear them every day we don&#39;t get taught
them at school I know I had a massive
crush on almost every single one of my
history teachers in high school and I
paid very careful attention to what they
were saying never heard this story
before and when confronted with a story
that you haven&#39;t heard before sometimes
people are resistant to a certain degree
that&#39;s to be expected
but definitely something they need to
work on other times there are people who
are devastated because here in front of
them is a concrete example of how the
world is so much stacked against them
and they&#39;re the ones I sympathize with
because it&#39;s only very recently and to
my shame that I am starting to learn
more about this story I feel their pain
because it&#39;s a pain that I have felt
myself it reminds me of something my dad
used to say to me I&#39;ll say it in English
to make it easier my dad never said they
can&#39;t teach you everything he said they
don&#39;t teach you everything
he didn&#39;t expand on the idea at the time
it might have helped but I think the
reason why he said it to me was because
that he could see what was happening and
what my education was doing to my
mindset in the way that I see the world
he could see that in any random
situation it&#39;s much more likely that a
line from a poem by Robert Frost is
going to pop into my head than a line
from a poem by any Bengali poet still
better late than never I use my position
and my work at UCL to try to get this
story out there in as many ways as I
possibly can in the scripture says I am
pleased I am pleased to be able to tell
this story but what I really AM is more
determined to make sure not only that I
keep telling this story but that we all
start to tell this and other stories
more because the more we tell it the
more we can move forward to a better
place together and what I hope I&#39;ve been
telling you is home is the place that
when I got there I tried to make it
better thank you
[Applause]
