so I&#39;m gonna do a magic show Oh
inspirational okay fine I like to start
by asking people how many people here
are in some sort of a relationship I
would hope all the hands go up right we
don&#39;t realize how important
relationships are and more importantly
how they impact us as leaders one of the
things I realized very early on so I&#39;m
originally from India came here in
second grade started school where I
learned a stray Apple and there was a
teacher who was kind enough we came here
at Memorial Day weekend who stayed in
the summer to teach us English I&#39;ll
never forget her name mrs. Schwartz nor
will I forget her feelings that she had
towards teaching us at the same time I
learned quite a bit about relationships
being new to America one of the things
was what not to do
so as I was going to school I thought
going as they say against the grain was
okay well needless to say probably for
about the first two three years of my
education my parents would have to come
and pick me up in the principal&#39;s office
I was blaming it on English as a second
language but my parents knew better it
was probably the fact that I quite
hadn&#39;t learned as a young child how
important relationships are so getting
into fights with students isn&#39;t really
the right way to have relationships now
that seems obvious to us as we grow
older but at the time it didn&#39;t seem
like I was doing that so I passed
forward and I go into high school and I
realize like okay that&#39;s not working for
me so what do I do now well parents had
always taught me that it&#39;s important to
help people what a simple message help
people I&#39;ve heard different messages
tonight about helping people
so I said you know what let me help
people in high school and I did I did
the best that I could with whatever I
could but how important relationships
are came to me it hit home thirty years
later I was recently at my high school
reunion and a person comes up to me and
he says me ty I said yes because of
course we all looked the same from 30
years ago right so he says is Bruce like
Bruce ooh gives me his last name I go oh
my god it&#39;s been 30 years he goes I just
wanted to say thank you I said for what
he said you helped me through math class
in 12th grade and I didn&#39;t realize back
then how much people remember how much
you helped them until 30 years later
although I had kept following that path
and we&#39;ll get to that in a second
imagine what our kids that are here or
our kids that we have that are younger
can do to make an impact on people&#39;s
lives that they may never find out about
that it&#39;ll take years for the other
people to kind of realize that you know
what I had somebody in my life whether
it was a teacher or a student who had an
impact on their lives from many many
years from before well I took that from
high school on to college and I realized
that as long as relationships are
working let me try to continue building
relationships and the relationships that
I built were all professional of course
we&#39;re all selfish and I realize if I
build professional relationships of
course they&#39;re gonna help me to help me
in my business to help me as a leader
within my own organization and it did
but what I realized is after about say 5
10 15 years is those relationships they
didn&#39;t really feel satisfying and why is
that because those sad those
relationships are built on something
that only we want it isn&#39;t until that
one thank you that I received at a
30-year reunion felt a lot more
satisfying than the professional
chips I had been built for so many years
so I realized that back in about 2008
and a start to have an impact on our
relationships what can we do as a
community to make difference in our
relationships with everybody every day
so that they feel like they&#39;re important
and this is where I think communities
can come together whether it&#39;s
day-to-day with our kids whether it&#39;s
day-to-day with the people that we work
with
whether it&#39;s day-to-day at the people
that we meet in the supermarket this is
where our leadership comes in and we
feel that leadership is only meant for
people that are in organizations that
are leading people but at every moment
at a minimum you are leading yourself at
every moment you&#39;re somewhere and
somebody&#39;s watching how you behave and
what you do and that leadership ability
comes with you no matter where you go so
as I explained this to students that I
go to campuses and speak I tell them
that you&#39;re just starting your career
but you have no idea how many lives you
can change you&#39;re gonna have your
day-to-day career anyway but how many
lives are you gonna impact because of
the way that you behave because of the
way that you think because of the way
that you help others and we know what&#39;s
going on in our political system and
things going on in the world imagine if
those just do to people and I won&#39;t name
them if they had a great relationship
but obviously they don&#39;t so one wants to
flare off and the other one wants to say
that you know America&#39;s number one if
just two people talked what would it do
imagine how if two people in our lives
that we have a disagreement with us and
somebody else if we just talked what a
difference it would make
and that and the conversations don&#39;t
need to be long they don&#39;t have to be
complicated they&#39;re simple sometimes
it&#39;s as simple hello sometimes it&#39;s a
simple sorry sometimes it&#39;s a thank you
but the important part is that
communication doesn&#39;t break down so what
I&#39;d like to offer up to everybody that&#39;s
here tonight is who&#39;s one person that
you can talk to to call to make a
difference in our community
where
we&#39;re students whether we&#39;re parents
whether we&#39;re teachers
whether we are in other professions we
are doing those things on a day to day
basis because that&#39;s our job but first
and foremost we are leaders and by
leaders relationships are what wide
people follow us so there&#39;s one person
you can call I encourage you go out
there and make that call when you leave
here tonight thank you
[Applause]
