if I told you to visualize a 16 year old
girl whose boat won a national
championship and crew and who rode a
hundred and sixty five miles from
Wellesley to Provincetown over the
course of one weekend I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d
visualize someone tall strong and
athletic and then there&#39;s me I am four
foot nine 73 pounds and not very
athletic and yet I have done both of
these things in the past two months
in fact my being a varsity athlete is
kind of a joke in the family if you knew
me well you know that I&#39;m not what even
a casual observer would call physically
fit but this past summer my diet and I
rode for the second time in the Pan Mass
Challenge a major to day Cycling
fundraiser to raise money for the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute after
successfully riding 80 miles on day one

we started day two by waking up at 4:00
a.m. riding over the Bourne Bridge at
dawn and watching the Sun rise over the
Cape Cod Canal but as the day wore on
the exhaustion set in and I began to
doubt my ability to finish the event
with ten miles left to go
Alma felt like an interminably steep
hill my dad and I stopped for a quick
water break unfortunately when we went
to restart
we lost our balance and fell on to the
hard pavement my dad&#39;s elbow was
bleeding profusely and my knee which had
been aching for most of the past two
days was scraped up and throbbing but
nothing was broken so we resolved to
finish the event we remounted our bike
summited the hill and turned north on to
a major road for the last eight mile
stretch straight into a fierce headwind
I could see the tip of the Cape in the
distance where the finish line was right
there in front of me but the wind
whipped around us seemingly pushing us
backwards as we struggled to make
progress a posse of bikers came up
beside us drafting behind each other
each member
taking a turn in the front so as to
allow the others behind them to take a
load off they asked us if we wanted to
join and we gladly tucked in behind them
bonding with our new friends who pulled
us along as we rode together we were
unified unified by our exhaustion
unified by our common goal and unified
by a cause with their support and
encouragement I was able to push past my
physical limitations exhaustion and pain
and make it to the finish but I didn&#39;t
just do this ride to feel athletic I was
motivated to help raise money and find a
cure for pediatric brain tumors I&#39;m
Samantha Genoa and I am a brain tumor
survivor 13 years ago just after my
third birthday
our babysitter noticed that I had
stopped using my right arm she thought I
had a stroke shortly thereafter I was
diagnosed with a brain tumor
I had a day-long neurosurgery at
Children&#39;s Hospital a few days later the
surgeons were able to remove most but
not all of the tumor and six months
later the remaining tumor started to
grow again
the oncologist discussed the various
options with my parents explaining that
the front-line chemotherapy for this
disease was toxic and not particularly
effective but doing nothing was not an
option and the long-term side effects of
radiating a young brain are far worse my
first round of chemotherapy required
weekly visits to the Jimmy Fund clinic
for injections to report in my chest my
mom says I used to ask her what was it
like when you had chemo as a kid didn&#39;t
everyone have to go through this that
chemo worked for a while until it didn&#39;t
my tumor started to grow again just as I
was entering kindergarten this time I
started a new regimen taking my
medication orally instead of through
injections for a young kid who had a
hard time taking pills it was pure
torture my parents tried to hide the
medicine in pudding but I always spit it
out to this day I still can&#39;t eat
pudding thanks mom
luckily this round of treatments was
more successful and my tumor has not
grown since the first grade four years
after my initial diagnosis if I&#39;m being
honest I don&#39;t remember much from this
time period of my life I was young and
it was traumatic I was fortunate to have
such terrific caregivers at the
dana-farber as well as loving and
supporting family and friends to help me
through this ordeal somehow I&#39;ve managed
to block out the most unpleasant
memories of being a cancer patient from
my mind as a young adults and childhood
cancer survivor I now see the myriad
ways in which this disease has affected
me both psychologically and physically
one example of this is that my right leg
is shorter than I left while this
doesn&#39;t affect me if I walk or stand I
can&#39;t run or participate in most sports
without hyperextending my knee as
another example my petite stature is a
function of having fallen off the growth
curb while on chemo compounding matters
the doctors ascribed my son Ted growth
to the treatments and we didn&#39;t discover
that I had celiac disease for a few
years later this caused me to miss
critical growth years as my pre teenage
body was unable to properly absorb
nutrition when I was 3 I started taking
dance class I loved twirling around the
music and ignoring the chaos of life
around me but cancer and treatment made
this difficult even years after leaving
the clinic I still felt like I could not
keep up with the other kids while I
still loved it I eventually quit as a
result when I entered high school I knew
almost no one despite being a generally
outgoing kid I felt nervous and shy I
became acutely aware of the fact that I
had not grown or developed like the
other kids to my classmates I looked
more like a younger sibling than their
peer making matters even worse in an
environment where most kids participated
in athletics I was one of the few not on
a fall sports team
but I soon found that none of this
matters my personality and my passions
are far more defining than my looks I
found a group of friends who liked me
for who I am and don&#39;t care about what I
look like or what I do or don&#39;t do if
you would ask me before I started high
school if I ever thought I would be on a
competitive sports team I would have
laughed and said no without any
hesitation but in the spring of my
freshman year I discovered through a
sport that relies on small people like
myself to steer the boat manage the race
and most importantly motivate the rowers
for the first time in my life I was a
part of a competitive sports team where
I could contribute and was welcomed my
diminutive size was actually an
advantage and as I worked to improve my
skills the girls came to trust me I love
the feeling of being a part of such a
close-knit competitive team this
newfound confidence that I found within
myself through Cru inspired me to take
risks in other places in my life that
spring I resolved to no longer let the
side effects of my cancer hold me back
that spring I resolved to ride the Pan
Mass Challenge for the first time for
years I had watched my dad and his
friends trained for the PMC to raise
money for the dana-farber and despite
there being a PMC teemed named after me
I never thought I could ride on Team
Samantha myself now I wanted to be out
there thinking those that had helped me
in my darkest hours and supporting the
other riders so my dad rented a tandem
bike and we started to train together
our first time out I could barely ride
ten miles and yet our training paid off
and my endurance gradually improved I
remember being extremely nervous at the
start but as the miles flew by I met
tons of people who told me how cancer
affected them but I wasn&#39;t really truly
inspired until mile 60 at the pedal
partner tent the PMC every year allows
pediatric cancer
patience to come and cheer on their
riders inspiring them to keep pedaling
when I was younger I had been one of
these kids not having any hope for
riding myself but encouraging the riders
to keep pedaling now I found myself
proudly standing in the position of a
rider I was overcoming my overwhelming
odds
I no longer like cancer or anything else
hold me back I was taking control of my
situation so I turn to you and ask what
has been holding you back everyone has
obstacles to overcome in life you and
you alone are the only one who can push
past the artificial boundaries you have
set up for yourself to help others and
change the world with hard work
determination and confidence in yourself
you can achieve much more than you know
thank you
[Applause]
you
