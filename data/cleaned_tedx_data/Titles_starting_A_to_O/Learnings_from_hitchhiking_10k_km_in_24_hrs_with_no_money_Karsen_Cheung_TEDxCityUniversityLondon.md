so a few years ago I hitched like 10,000
kilometers in 24 hours
we&#39;ve got using any money and it was a
journey from London to Kuala Lumpur
Malaysia and I&#39;m sure you want to hear
how I did that
but before I get to that I&#39;m gonna give
you another story three point five seven
notice the degrees of separation that
seven the seven billion people on planet
Earth that curly have so what that
basically means is every single person
on this planet on average are separated
by only three point five seven
connections and you might find that
really mind-boggling but it&#39;s actually
backed up by some real data so in 20s
2006 Microsoft that does analysis on
their electronic communication data and
it looked at it and they said actually
everyone in their database we&#39;re only
separated by roughly six point six
degrees of connection and separation
however in just a simple ten years when
we had the digital revolution all of
that change three point five seven is
the new number last year which meant
there&#39;s no real data to prove that
digital revolution has fundamentally
brought us closer so back to my story
I&#39;ve worked in companies that do digital
products and physical products so I&#39;ve
got a very unique perspective and
commenting on how digital and physical
connectivity and infrastructure work
hand-in-hand together therefore at the
moment I&#39;m building a coffee
distribution business from China to
Europe and back that leverages some of
these new technology and infrastructure
that we currently have and as there&#39;s
some early recent research that showed
from a doctor drinking four cups of
coffee a day is probably good for you
but at the same time I also keen travel
I travel a lot I spend a lot of time on
the road on a laptop doing work because
of nature of my work and I&#39;m really
privileged to be able to do that but my
favorite travel experience has to
yes London to Malaysia Kuala Lumpur
there was 24 hours 10,000 kilometers and
we did it over seven different modes of
transportation and without using any
money and the reason I was able to do
that was we were participating in this
jailbreak hitchhiking events so the
further we went the more money we raised
for charity and I thought okay what is
the fastest way to get from point A to
point B in the current world well love
you have thought of a way it&#39;s a
hitchhiking so let&#39;s hop on a lorry or
hop on a train get somewhere far away
but I thought actually no flying is the
fastest way we have right now so I
actually used my digital skills research
skills ie stalking online so found
emails of CEO is that owned Airlines and
run airline businesses reached out to
them gave them a decent proposal and in
return they actually gave us free
flights to travel from London to Kuala
Lumpur we did some PR for them but you
know I thought it was a very fair trade
and most importantly we rallied
ourselves and the cause and the
initiative on social media so people
were able to see what we&#39;re doing and
also the basically the further we went
the more impressed they got and
eventually we also started taking some
of the bosses which are pledges so
effectively one of them was if you found
a Ferrari and you&#39;d get to speak to your
feet number Ferraris owners you we would
pledge 100 pounds extra to your college
and so we did that and some people then
we shared stories about how we were
sleeping in hostels with clean some of
the hostels you know to get a free night
and then someone said actually I already
paid for a Mandarin Oriental Hotel
booking and inside the twin tower in
Kuala Lumpur so go and enjoy that we
didn&#39;t ask for it it was all because of
the social media but L then brings me to
this point I think after that trip I
realised time is the most precious
commodity that we have right now we can
earn more time and you can&#39;t have less
time however
if you think about and we&#39;re able to
accelerate our transportation our
infrastructure how much more can we do
how much more can we achieve with that
extra time and we&#39;re more productive
more efficiently using our time and then
to another insight I came out of that
trip which human beings had an innate
desire to connect and that&#39;s no erased
by the fact that digital revolution has
brought us much closer because no matter
how good Facebook Google our people
still want to meet with each other in
real life and ultimately companies like
uber Amazon they all exist because they
have a massive physical infrastructure
that supports a technology platform that
you see so they are not strictly a tech
company they&#39;re actually a technology
company and a physical business that&#39;s
linked up together very well and people
always thought video conferencing Skype
they will eliminate business meetings
well the fact that you guys are sat here
today and now I&#39;m just watching this on
YouTube mence
this is actually not true people still
want to see each other in real life and
be part of something in life and all of
this desire innate desire to explore in
connect has led us to this couple
thousand years ago people are traveling
alone journeys on camels and horses and
then we invented the wheel and then we
motor vehicles we had trains and we&#39;re
aircrafts at one point even supersonic
aircrafts and high-speed railroads
magnetic levitation train is meaning
people could travel more frictionlessly
without actually touching the tracks and
now we&#39;re going to have self-driving
vehicles it brings me to where we are
currently this is the China Europe
railroad which was open for the very
very first time earlier this year that
Lynx II will which is the city close to
Shanghai all the way to London non-stop
journey and what that really means for a
businessman like me or avoid you for you
guys is because it&#39;s now delivering a
faster cheaper more reliable less risky
service for all of our physical goods so
all of your Amazon products already made
in China products could actually come
through this rich much cheaper much
faster but at the same time have you
thought about what we in Europe and
bring back
to China and to other countries for
example products like European wine by
definition cannot be made in China so
that&#39;s something for you to think about
but what that really means in real life
is we&#39;re now half the time of maritime
transportation using this railroad to
travel through the Suez Canal normally
takes 24 thousand kilometers and that
the container ship is way too big for
the Suez Canal it has to go all the way
down to South Africa and loop back up
but right now this is doing it an 11,000
kilometers one-fifth of the cost of air
transportation and half the time of
maritime transportation and what that
really means is we&#39;re saving 30 days in
transportation from 48 days to 18 days
and then comes the Hyperloop we&#39;re now
still testing its 2017 it&#39;s not going to
happen this year but we have already
successfully tested speeds up to 200
miles per hour these are effectively
frictionless tubes that people can
travel in a pod and get be shot through
high speed and long distance but the
theoretical top speed is actually 700 to
2,400 miles per hour which by the way is
our the speed of sound or three times
the speed of sound and that sort of
journey or that sort of speed would
effectively cut London Shanghai down to
two hours if we can reach that
theoretical speed and then looking back
we had the ancient Silk Road where
people and traded goods and services
like silk wool gold teeth spices but
also ideas and in best practices and
technology and that went all the way
from Rome Venice all the way to Shanghai
in China but that also loads of
countries are enriched in India in the
Middle East in Africa that actually
benefit from this and when those
connectivities were drawn their hotels
popped up restaurants popped up and
there&#39;s prosperity that was brought to
the entire world along the routes and
one really notable project is in the
last couple of years there&#39;s been a 900
billion dollar investment called the
belton road in ish
that&#39;s trying to revive the Silk Road or
we have the next revolution beyond just
simple digital connectivity we&#39;re now
bringing back physical connectivity to
the world it goes on to different routes
one online
one down self through the three of the
oceans but also it strategically touches
many to some of the biggest cities and
the ports in the world right now
so 900 billion dollar what does that
mean walk city a country in the middle
of Central Asia will benefit from this
is called Kazakhstan and it&#39;s six times
the GDP of Kazakhstan so imagine that
impact it has on culture in economics
politics and ideas that we&#39;ll have in
Kazakhstan and also other countries
around that but the same time you didn&#39;t
think about this is just an
infrastructure investment what about all
the regional investment that comes along
with it like I mentioned earlier we use
there are hotels and restaurants that
benefit from it what about language
exchanges what about travel and tourism
all that would be in several part of
this infrastructure project and a lot
more regional investment that comes out
of it and this is even more
mind-boggling 4.4 billion people are
actually part of these participating
countries that&#39;s currently 63 percent of
the world&#39;s population has already
signed up to this project and will
somehow be impacted and at the moment
these countries only represent 29
percent of the world&#39;s GDP but this is
the current figure without any of these
railroads being fully established
imagine the growth these countries could
have once these railroads are to
establish how much easier it will be to
do business internationally so why does
this matter to you you might be thinking
well these are huge infrastructure
projects that has no relation to me
sitting in London right actually no
because digital connectivity can only
get us so far but digital connectivity
is a technology that ultimately serves
us and so that allows us our physical
daily lives to be easier faster and
simpler and also why it also matters to
you is because you&#39;re sitting here
thinking about what to do in your career
in the next 20 30 40
years well if this is a hugely
inevitable trend and as I demonstrate
earlier it&#39;s never stopped since to
three thousand years and were innovation
in transportation has always been a key
theme then you really need to be an
early adopter and I urge you to think
beyond the careers in your comfort zone
and the immediate surrounding and
develop Europe and develop economies
what about countries in the BRIC
countries what about countries that are
beyond the BRIC countries on roots in
Central Asia in Africa and the Middle
East and India that will also be
benefiting from this project and I urge
you to think about how to build a
long-lasting career in this context of
physical infrastructure acceleration
thank you
