my 12th birthday one the very first
things I did after school was go to the
pharmacy to pick up medication for my
asthma analogies that included three
inhalers one for every day one for why I
got sick in one rescue inhaler one ball
of allergy medicine and the dreaded
nasal spray soon you and I won&#39;t have to
go the pharmacy at all
we can stop diseases before they even
start previous attempts to alter the
human genome have been clumsy imprecise
in all out difficult to use but not
anymore the future of evolution is one
engineered by humans not nature you
don&#39;t need to be a scientists understand
science health decisions should be made
with the public in a partnership this
issue is not a policymakers issue it&#39;s
not scientists issue it&#39;s not even a
patient&#39;s issue because this issue is
really everyone&#39;s issue so let&#39;s take a
step as a society towards this big scary
risk as the international community
tiptoes that&#39;s towards that future it&#39;s
more important than ever to understand
the possible outcomes of this situation
the public needs to be aware of what
choice they&#39;re making and where that
complete I assure you there will be no
orange eyes or purple tails in our
futures so I think this decision is
quite positive and I hope you will too
so what is genome editing genome editing
is the modification of the genetic
material DNA inside your cells when DNA
copies itself it&#39;s been making changes
all the time and usually these don&#39;t
result in anything too drastic however
one one mistake is made in 3.1 billion
catastrophe can occur
in the germline the portion of DNA
passed from parent to child
if there&#39;s a mistake in that particular
sequence we can cause sickle-cell anemia
in athelia or even cystic fibrosis both
new and innovative technology we won&#39;t
have to face these diseases any longer
so before we get to what genome editing
is let&#39;s explore the basics of DNA DNA
is made up of two sets of base pairs
adenine pairs with thymine you can
remember as a is and teens apples with
trees guanine pairs the sizing chisme
sees cars with garages all these base
pairs connect together into larvae that
then twists into double helix DNA
resides in the nucleus the brain of the
cell so how does genome editing work
genome editing works with this new and
promising tool called CRISPR which
stands for quite a mouthful clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic
who repeats what that really means is
that CRISPR acts similarly to a virus to
take control of the cell&#39;s production of
DNA
once that cell produces more DNA CRISPR
will go into the sequence cut through
the double helix and remove the
unnecessary DNA that&#39;s causing the
mutation from here the cell connects the
two ends back together or adds an
additional DNA to fix the mutation thus
we&#39;ve cured this disease as our
scientists have explored this big
possibility we&#39;ve come up with some very
pressing questions once the most
prominent being what would this mean for
us today as for now the healthcare
debate wouldn&#39;t even exist with this
type of technology those most vulnerable
to losing their health care due to
chronic illness wouldn&#39;t have to worry
anymore
while the sleepless night so apparent
concern for the health of their child
could be averted beyond portent
hereditary disease we can find and
remove risk factors for things like
cancer parts of the population have a
gene that allows them to be
be resistant we could then spread this
trait to everyone scientists before us
have worked hard to map the genome in
the human genome project but before that
was just a bunch of A&#39;s and T&#39;s and G&#39;s
and seeds that meant nothing but now
along a similar vein to the scientist
before us it&#39;s time to start putting
data with meaning now citizens will be
able to soon live more productive
happier healthier lives doing what they
love genome editing has been finding big
solutions to problems we&#39;ve been facing
for millennia however genome editing
also brings unique problems that demand
innovative solutions manufacturers
administrators and modders of genome
editing will have massive powers over
our lives and futures this can easily
lead to discrimination where certain
demographics lack access to genome
editing what happens when only the rich
can afford you know editing what happens
when it&#39;s in the hands of politicians to
me making choices about your health what
happens if we do nothing at all the
risks of unequal access to genome
editing are just as dangerous as the
risks of orange eyes and purple tails
there&#39;s enormous resources required to
be able to finesse the entire human
society into one that&#39;s been genome
edited so we have to ask this question
who pays for all this
should it be democratic governments or
private corporations the government
would be able if it so chooses to
subsidize genome editing then everyone
would have the choice maybe one day in
the future to decide whether they want
their DNA and or not when scientific
projects have been well funded we&#39;ve
reached the moon the Stars and into the
sea now it is time to reach inside
ourselves health is a universal human
right that isn&#39;t guaranteed and can be
easily taken advantage of how far would
you go to gain the resources necessary
to change your own fate how far would
you go to save the life of a loved one
soon we won&#39;t have to ask these
questions any longer in the future it
will be our decision as a whole not just
scientists under when we undertake the
editing of the human genome this is a
choice for all of us to be making
together I want you to sit down the
table and talk to figure out exactly
what do you see in our future because
this is a real possibility how far is
too far what qualifies to be edited
because of this we really need to know
where we stand and we need to have this
conversation not just with ourselves not
with our friends but with everyone
because scientists can&#39;t just make these
decisions then they&#39;re going to affect
the entire population let&#39;s make an
investment in our future perhaps a
future door of mine won&#39;t have to face
the same slow blindness through my great
grandmother did our generation will go
out this problem this just as hard as
the last one went at it but with our own
twist and DNA does not will not define
us what will is our actions thank you
[Music]
you
