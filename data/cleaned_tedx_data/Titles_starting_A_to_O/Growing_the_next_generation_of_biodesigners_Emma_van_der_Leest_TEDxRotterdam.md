imagine if we could grow mother-of-pearl
to create a new car paint for Tesla
instead of using chemical paints or what
if we could grow pigments producing
bacteria to dye your new bag these
examples may sound like science fiction
but they are science facts and actually
these are examples of bio design the
process of integrating living organisms
in the design process so for example
bacteria algae fungi or any other cells
but these examples are still made in a
laboratory and where do I go to as
designer to learn these skills I don&#39;t
know and if you want to grow a
sustainable future
we need more by designers who literally
make this happen work on these fields
work together with scientist and as a
first-year year product design students
at the withum de Kooning my curiosity
for micro organisms didn&#39;t start at
university didn&#39;t start in the
laboratory but started in a boy months
from burning a museum here in Rotterdam
what do you think of this jacket looks
soft shiny but actually it&#39;s made by
bacteria yes I was so fascinating by
seeing this that we could literally grow
something with bacteria that I was
determined to grow this at home so I
found out that the recipe to make this
is actually green tea sugar and acetic
vinegar
and you need a bacterial culture via
some YouTube videos from Suzanne
designer I found out that these bacteria
could spin a nano fiber from pure
cellulose and Suzanne the designer of
the jacket wrote a book about the future
of fashion and she met a biologist who
told her that we could actually grow our
garments in vats of liquid but I had to
get hold of a bacterial culture and
actually with this nutrient solution you
can also make a fermenting tea and I
found out that in a new-age shop in
Rotterdam we can also buy other
scientific stuff like incense healing
stones and salt lamps there was an old
lady who had a little bacterial culture
for me so I took it home and quickly
according to my friends my student dorm
changed into an acetic biohazard because
actually the bacteria eat sugar and
produced his nano fiber on the top this
jellies stuff if you dry it down you get
something like a vegetable leather and
actually I was determined to be
Suzanne&#39;s intern I wanted to go to
London to be here intern and collaborate
with scientists and actually I got a
little bit disappointed when she told me
she was looking for a biology student
instead of a product design student and
I had to persist over months sending
letters in order to persuade her and I
succeed because this is an image of the
studio and during my internship I met
scientists I&#39;ve met amazing corporate
companies who are willing to integrate
these living materials in a production
process and actually imagine a material
which is not woven but grown in vats
like this where designers engineers and
scientists
work on these new future materials again
I was determined to follow the material
science minor at tu Delft but I got
refused I know why because my skills of
physics and mathematics what was quiet
low and this was caused by my
dyscalculia so it&#39;s the trouble of
reading numbers and formulas they said
you should follow a design minor you&#39;re
a product designer you&#39;re not a
scientist and I was disappointed I
thought man I need to get access to a
lab I wanted to grow these materials I
want to collaborate with scientists
ditch shouldn&#39;t beat his heart so I
thought okay I followed the design and
engineering minor at the University of
Rotterdam and why I had a plan because
in the same building the chemistry and
biomedical department was housed so I
was very close to a lab and when me in
my group entered the lab and asked
instructors if they are willing to help
us they laughed at us they said sorry
you&#39;re not a biology student you cannot
work here you don&#39;t know anything about
hygiene you don&#39;t know anything about
cells so refused again we were quite
disappointed because the idea was to
grow a packaging from mushrooms and from
hemp so here you see an aquaponics
system and an urban farm in Rotterdam
and they use use these hemp mats in the
system to grow leafy vegetables and
herbs and after growing these plants the
heap hemp Nets ended up on a compost
heap such a shame because hemp is such a
durable material they also grew shiitake
mushrooms on these blocks of sadhus and
actually we found out that mushrooms
grow on any form of cellulose including
hemp
we thought maybe we can optimize their
production process by combining the two
so because we didn&#39;t had a lab we had to
build on one ourselves and here you see
me with a Tupperware box some kitchen
gloves trying to combine mushrooms and
ham together I can tell you it wasn&#39;t a
success but here you see me in the lab
because one of my friends was studying
at University and I got her login
details to get access to the library of
the University so we found out that we
found out the process of cultivating
these mushrooms on hemp so we went back
to the lab at the University and we said
hey we prove their knowledge so can we
get access right now and it was bingo
and here you see my old pickled jars
jars for my pickles we had to inoculate
so put mushrooms onto the hand mats and
we didn&#39;t really had a nice box to do
that so we use these glass jars so what
we did we put the seeds of the mushroom
onto the use hand mats and waited for a
couple of days and then it become
completely white and this white stuff is
called mycelium which is the veget of
part of a mushroom growing under the
ground and actually this mycelium took
over the complete mess and if you dry it
down and cut it out you get a very
lightweight material and actually these
are properties of a mushroom its water
water repellents it&#39;s fire resistant and
it&#39;s super lightweight ideal for
packaging and this was our first results
I was very happy with it but I know it
looks a little bit gross
but why do you buy those blue packaging
in the supermarkets with mushrooms
because it&#39;s easy to stack in your
fridge
actually this one is made from mushroom
itself it&#39;s made with a waste stream and
actually with this process we optimized
a production system at the urban farm
and this was really a kickstart for me
to collaborate with scientist and to
work in a lab although it was quite hard
and during I had to I had to graduate
and I had a serious identity crisis
because I thought I&#39;m not a biologist
I&#39;m certainly not the scientist but I&#39;m
not a classic product designer and I was
trying to to find my new role as
designer so I went back to London where
I worked next to PhD students at the
University of London to see Africa well
to find my identity and I&#39;ve published
this book form follows organism and it&#39;s
a research about this new role of
designer we have where we have to create
a new language where I have to design
differently where we have to merge
fields of design technology and biology
together and by showing examples from
the industry I try to explain the new
roles your workshop is changing from a
standard workshop to a laboratory and I
worked with a smart ogre organism who
could basically design even better
shapes than I could ever imagine because
this organism could actually based on
this algorithm optimized geometric
patterns and shapes I thought ok we are
able to grow these new materials but
where do I go to I need to create a
place and how amazing would it be to
create a laboratory where everyone can
access where they learn about biology
and technology
and in 2016 I became part of the blue
city team and the former Tropicana
swimming pool blue city is an example of
the blue economy where we create jobs
where we create new business models and
where we create new products from waste
streams and bacteria and I can tell you
the formal locker rooms it&#39;s an ideal
place for cultivating mushrooms and to
design new fermenting processes and this
is where the blue city lab is arising in
the lab we make it more easier for
designers and scientists to collaborate
so we have a wet lab where we literally
find new ways of using waste streams
organic waste streams combined it with
bacteria and fungi to optimize better
materials and make them compostable and
applicable we have a makerspace a
workshop where we literally design a
product from the sell to a scalable
product and we have a taste up for
religious shaped the acres of the future
for example cultivating spirulina algae
we create we apply and we share together
in an open source environment and by
lowering the threshold
using biotechnology innovation and
design will flourish and if we want to
create a sustainable future we&#39;ll not
only need to design and grow new
materials not only have to design
differently we have to grow the next
generation of by designers grow the
future with us thank you
