so in one minute I&#39;ll ask you I&#39;ll show
you two pictures and these are two
people and I&#39;ll ask you to rate them on
two trades warmth and competence warmth
is how you perceive them as trustworthy
likeable frankly helpful do you feel
safe and do you trust they want to do
you good and competence it&#39;s how you
perceive them in terms of having
abilities skills intelligence Authority
and power so I&#39;ll ask you to rate them a
scale from one to five one being low
five being high and as you look at each
person for just a few seconds make a
mental note of your rating okay are you
ready okay
make your rating now warmth competence
make your rating warmth competence let&#39;s
take a look at who these people are
this is Ted Bundy he was a serial killer
rapist confessed to killing 30 women so
how many of you perceived him hi and
warmth for five to take a look around
with spotting patterns now I&#39;d say the
majority of you but it might have just a
little bit different pussy scene and how
many of you rated him high and perceived
him high incompetence four or five the
majority of you well you&#39;re not the only
ones receiving Ted people looking like
Ted high on warmth and competence I have
the privilege of working with thousands
of people around the world and this is
the exact same pattern in our workplaces
and our societies the reason why that is
is because I want unconscious mind
automatically in a split-second receive
him
incompetent because he fits an implicit
norm for what we perceive a competent
person and leader looks like it&#39;s called
mr. corporate masculinity most people in
power and leadership decisions actually
fit this norm worldwide researchers have
identified this implicit norm in Asia
Europe and North America the problem is
this is a norm that only benefits the
few of us and is a disadvantage to the
majority of us let&#39;s take a look at how
you&#39;re perceived total it how many of
you received him high on warmth to take
a look around the difference not a lot
how many of you perceived him high
incompetence take a look around
hardly anybody maybe the beard and the
baldness triggered an association to
criminal gang member
terrorists fear the Judas split second
projected on to him even though he&#39;s
just a nice calm guy from a small town
in Denmark Oh actually yeah in this kind
of intervention he rarely gets credit
for being friendly helpful and
intelligent but he is totally behavioral
change specialist and practitioner is
working with troubled teenagers in a
special unit in a public school in
Denmark and he he has a track record and
helping them thrive and he&#39;s also the
father of three daughters my daughter&#39;s
told us my husband
yeah a good guy
yeah I kind of sense you sitting down
there somewhere because somebody was
laughing and somebody was saying now
she&#39;s a good guy but what happens is
that even though this is just an
exercise we were influenced like this
all the time in real life these snap
bias judgments influence how we interact
with people if we ask them for advice
how we listen if we hire them promote
them if we buy in on their ideas this
means that we make choices based on
appearance stereotypes and implicit
norms more than based on facts and
cheapest abilities and scalars so Wadden
who will be missing out on in our
workplaces in our communities and in our
societies what and who will be blindly
seduced by and what information
knowledge ideas people are we executing
I&#39;d say given the current state of the
whirlwind right now we have plenty of
proof that we do both and that we make
some pretty poor decisions this way but
not only that the lack of inclusiveness
is strongly correlated with people
feeling disempowered loss of dignity
excluded from their society lonely shame
of not being good enough and as a result
we get radicalization you get suicides
we get polarization get terrorism or get
blaming and shaming of the others and
this is really just to mention a few of
the problems that we are dealing with in
our societies around the world today
this is a meaningless waste of human
potential
and this is not a good strategy for any
of us but what is a good strategy for
all of us is to be inclusive of diverse
perspectives and people of diverse
backgrounds
all the time but more importantly when
we have to solve a task or a challenge
or make a decision because then we are
much better able to see and develop new
solutions apply critical thinking and
reduce groupthink and we make better
decisions this way we innovate better we
perform better and we really need this
because the world is changing at a pace
and a scale unprecedented and we need to
radically rethink and redo how we
innovate for the future and how we
achieve the 17th local goals for a more
sustainable world and if you don&#39;t know
those goals please make sure you go
check them out we need all people
involved in this and inclusiveness is it
means to do that we have decades decades
of proof from research and experience
that there are so many benefits for us
in being inclusive and applying
diversity but too often we&#39;re missing
out on all these benefits because the
default in our behavior and our
decision-making is execution rather than
inclusion and here&#39;s a catch it would be
so nice to say that the current said the
world has do too bad evil ignorant
people populist and alt-right movements
and capitalism because then we could
just blame them it&#39;s not bad people
being biased or executing it&#39;s human
beings it&#39;s all of us
it&#39;s inherent in our mind and in the
systems were a part of and given that
you hear the TEDx event this is a wild
guess but my method my best guess is
your self perception is that you are
open-minded
the open to diversity and you treat
people fair yeah I know - yet we raided
Ted and told set to be dead told that
the rating of told us on you I obviously
had a different perception of him but we
might actually be having a gap and I
think we have plenty of proof of that
I&#39;ll return to that that we have a gap
between our self-deception and I&#39;m
snapped by his judgments we might
actually be doing something that goes
against their own values and our
intentions to be inclusive and this way
we of all people are actually a part of
the problem that sucks
that&#39;s what we have to change so how do
we do that
and why is this what&#39;s going on if we&#39;re
supposed to be the good people the human
mind has two independent systems at work
at all times it&#39;s like two modes of
thinking it&#39;s what Professor Daniel
Kahneman call a system one and system
two system one is the unconscious mind
it&#39;s it&#39;s intuitive it&#39;s instinctive
it&#39;s emotional and it&#39;s irrational and
it&#39;s like an automatic kind of thinking
so it&#39;s not something we can control and
system two is the conscious mind it&#39;s
self reflective and it&#39;s rational a
system one is the system doing our
behavior and that does not always match
our system - intentions and knowledge so
there is a gap and the problem is we&#39;re
blind to this gap between these two
brain systems and as such we&#39;re blind to
the consequences and closing this gap is
absolutely crucial but talking about it
is not gonna make us see something we&#39;re
blind to because it doesn&#39;t work like
that so I&#39;m an anthropologist I have
studied psychology I know a lot about
human behavior
I know system wanna know about system -
and I thought I have my
together in this turns out site I didn&#39;t
I had a huge gap between my knowledge
and what I was doing with that knowledge
but I didn&#39;t realize this until I was
working in a multinational company as
the global head of inclusion and
diversity my job was to get 15,000
people to be a bit more inclusive it&#39;s
like pushing water uphill I was working
so hard on getting people to raft me
understand the importance of this I was
you know I was delivering business cases
and data and rational arguments and it
didn&#39;t work and I kept trying and I kept
trying and then I kept trying what made
me wake up was the brain analogy by a
psychologist named Jonathan Haidt and it
fundamentally changed my approach hi
describes the two brain systems like an
elephant and its Rider
the elephant is system one the
unconscious mind and the rider is system
to the rational mind and this image is
important when it comes to behavioral
change because it illustrates a
difference in how big and influence
these two brain systems have on our
behavior and decision-making the
elephant the unconscious mind is doing
90 to 99 percent of our behavior the
rider can only guide us in the right
direction by understanding why and if
the destination is meaningful but it&#39;s
too hard for that little rider is too
difficult to move a six-ton heavy
elephant if it doesn&#39;t feel like it and
when it comes to inclusiveness it really
doesn&#39;t feel like it because the system
is driven by survival instincts emotions
a preference for status quo
anything that&#39;s familiar to us
simplicity and it has a very strong
tribal mentality a preference for
similar others makes us feel safe and
unconsciously we&#39;re more sceptical
towards the others and those who do not
fit the norms this system is not
influenced by rational arguments about
the importance of applying human
potential and
being you know applying diversity and
equal opportunities for everybody it
couldn&#39;t care less so for years I was
talking to the wrong brain system and I
was speaking the world language and I
think it&#39;s fair to say a lot of other
people might be making the same mistake
so here&#39;s what I learned the hard way to
get the needed changes at the pace we
need today we have to go directly for
the elephant to get it moving and that
is a completely different language so
today I&#39;ll just share with you three
ways to move the elephant for
inclusiveness and close the gap things
that you can do in your sphere of
influence through your daily actions so
you can change the behavior of the
unconscious mind by making people feel
the need to be inclusive and not not by
making them rationally understand the
need it&#39;s like creating an eye-opening
experience for them like the picture
exercise we did with Tarrant halls they
built on the principle show don&#39;t tell
how people spot a behavioral pattern
they didn&#39;t know they had helped people
see a gap that they&#39;re blind to because
this can change and motivate the
unconscious mind to want to change
behavior but motivation is not always
enough another way you can change the
behavior of the unconscious mind is
designing processes to make
inclusiveness the default make it easy
for people to do inclusiveness
automatically as a part of something
they&#39;re already doing without relying
and a lot of willpower and conscious
awareness so one lone example of this is
the big is the blind music editions in
many of the big symphony orchestras
around the world you might know about
this but in the evaluation the selection
process musicians do their audition
behind a screen so the evaluation
committee can&#39;t see the musician and
they&#39;re forced to focus their attention
on performance and can&#39;t be influenced
by appearance or biases designing the
process to anonymize anonymize the
musicians like this completely
changed who was perceived as the most
competent candidate for the job it led
to 35 to 40% more women being selected
and the ethnic makeup of these officers
significantly changed we cannot stop
ourselves from being biased but we can
design the process to do it for us by
default the third way you can move the
elephant inclusiveness is by framing
perceptions to make inclusiveness the
norm the simple way to do that is simply
to ask yourself questions in your own
head that can flip and change your
perception of people or the information
or idea that people are sharing with you
you simply ask this philippic question
as you&#39;re speaking with people listening
to them or collaborating with them or
meeting them for the first time so it
works like this so these are some of my
questions if she was a man
would I have interpreted what she just
did differently majority of times my
answer to that question is yes despite
of having worked for inclusiveness
gender parity for 17 years I still have
a gender bias that sneaks in but when I
asked this people question I&#39;m actually
able to flip and change what I see in
here in the moment as I&#39;m speaking or
collaborating with her and in this way
my biases are not running the show
another flip a question of mine is if he
was tall would I have listened
differently to what he just said I
definitely I mean of course tall people
are the most competent people
okay okay towards what arguing with me
my biases that the tallest people are
the smartest people turns out I&#39;m not
the only one having this bias
researchers have identified a worldwide
with a huge impact on politics business
and opportunities so start asking some
flippin questions will you not just to
yourself but also to other people and
say you to this day I am still so
surprised when spotting my own biases I
don&#39;t always like what I see
but I never feel ashamed I just embrace
it and these are really just three
examples of how you can contribute to
make our world more inclusive we have 70
examples more to share with you and more
to come
power of sharing these practical
examples is actually what led me and
another global changemaker Lisa kopetsky
to co-found a non-profit peer-to-peer
initiative in 2013 we call this
initiative and these practical examples
inclusion nudges because these
behavioral interventions are designed to
nudge the unconscious mind without
relying on a lot of effort and we
believe everybody can learn how to do
this and must have those easy as a
critical basic skill we set out to
create a global movement to
fundamentally change how to achieve
inclusiveness faster and make it stick
so what we do is we design and we
collect and we share all these inclusion
nudges with as many people as possible
worldwide people of all walks of life
people of all professions people like
you basically to make to enable you to
make a difference in your sphere of
influence and to move that elephant for
inclusiveness
so despite of being a believer and
despite of my strong belief that this
approach will make a difference some
days that gets the better of me and
whenever I start doubting that we will
ever live in a more inclusive world I
always turn to anthropologist Margaret
Mead she said never doubt that a small
group of thoughtful committed citizens
can change the world indeed it&#39;s the
only thing that ever has so I put my
trust in you and I hope you feel the
need to join and together change our
world for good thank you
