what you think of as Europe&#39;s refugee
crisis is a lie the amount of people who
have arrived on this continent Shores in
the past year make up 0.02 9 percent of
Europe&#39;s total population 0.02 9 percent
and you see I have a problem with the
word crisis I think it&#39;s an excuse I
think it makes us think that we can do
no better it makes it okay to teargas
teenagers on the borders of Macedonia or
trade humans like cargo between Turkey
and Greece it makes us think that this
is the best we can do
so is it is this the best we can do
first time that I went to volunteer in
the refugee camp in calais
was nearly two years ago when I came
back people often asked me they said
what was the most shocking thing that
you experienced and they think that I
will say something that I saw in the
camp I don&#39;t for me the most shocking
part of that entire entire trip was just
the moment that I arrived back home i
sat down in my kitchen and I opened up a
newspaper article about the migrants of
Calais and I just started to read the
comments underneath over and over again
I just I couldn&#39;t stop myself
comments made by people who had no idea
of the things that I had just seen
cowards ruined their country and now
they&#39;ve come to ruin us brave enough to
fight the French but not brave enough to
fight in their own land but can I tell
you can I tell you who I met there in
that camp I met a math teacher from
Sudan I met a 17 year old boy from
Eritrea whose entire family had been
killed by Islamic state militants in
Libya enroute and yet who had still
fought on and still believed in this
dream that one day he could live his
life in safety and in peace I met a
librarian from Afghanistan who gave out
free tea and I met a seven year old girl
called Marika who gave me a friendship
bracelet and told me we were farsi
sisters I met people who needed papers
or an education
some kindness of an opportunity but I
did not meet one person who did not have
something that they wanted to give back
you see the style of thinking that the
authors of those comments
unfortunately possess it actually limits
us all
it limits the asylum seeker to that one
dimensional character featured in
sensationalist newspaper articles and it
limits my country because instead of
seeing a man fluent in four languages we
see a dirty migrant sleeping in the
rough of a French port what we fail to
see is that this this is a temporary
state when we use words like refugee
asylum seeker migrant we fail to see
beyond that refugee does not say look I
was once a doctor or I will become a
human rights lawyer it does not say I am
clever enough to develop the theory of
relativity as Einstein himself a refugee
once famously did being a refugee does
not mean that you are incompetent or
that you are unable to do something for
yourself it means that you are resilient
actually the only thing that it always
means is that you have overcome
something unimaginable to have
outsmarted bombs and hunger survived a
sea that has claimed the lives of two
thousand nine hundred and twenty-five
people in 2017 alone to face racism and
disgust and comments like those
I admire more than that I am in awe I am
in awe of the bravery that these kinds
of decisions demand from a person nobody
nobody wants to be a refugee nobody
wants to sit in a foreign country and
talk about their home in the past tense
but we are beyond naive if we think that
this could never again happen to us the
right to claim asylum it&#39;s the most
sacred thing it&#39;s the most incredible
thing that we have ever created to think
that I owe that you or that my children
or that your grandchildren will always
be able to live their life in safety if
ever the tables are turned
that&#39;s revolutionary do you know what
that says to warfare that says war you
are nothing
because the second you become too much
we can just get up and leave I am so so
frustrated by the way that we continue
to abuse the right to claim asylum I get
that it&#39;s not easy a child who has
languished 7 10 12 years in a camp in
Lebanon does not see the world in the
same way as yours truly a starry-eyed
only child from Wales but can&#39;t you see
that every day spent in that transit
camp only exaggerated s&#39; the differences
between us it only adds more to the
common problems of humanity can&#39;t you
see that for every refugee child who
does not receive an education the end
willd has lost that I told you that
Europe&#39;s refugee crisis is a lie but
there is a crisis on a far bigger scale
and I can tell you what that is it&#39;s the
lack of doctors in my country in Britain
and the sheer waste of the fact that
there are hundreds of doctors idly
wasting away in camps across Europe and
the Middle East the crisis is the fact
that these two parallels exist and we
resolutely do not believe in bridging
them the crisis this is the fact that
there are thousands of teachers just
waiting for papers waiting for their
lives to begin again and at the same
time education becomes more and more
inaccessible to those who one day will
be required to build their countries up
from the rubble the bombs have left
behind the crisis is the fact that it is
practically impossible to legally claim
asylum from some of the richest
countries in the world that that is the
crisis it is so easy to hate and fear
people you do not know that is the
easiest thing to do in the world it&#39;s
only when you begin to get to know a
person to understand them and to relate
to them then you cannot hate and you
cannot label and you cannot be afraid
would you believe me if I told you that
the closest feeling I have had to home
since living in the Netherlands actually
came from having dinner with a Syrian
family or there I trained on a team of
Olympic athletes and never once knew one
as determined or as inspiring as a
refugee thing is you shouldn&#39;t believe
me believing me is not enough you should
go out there and experience this for
yourself because the real antidote to
Europe&#39;s refugee crisis it&#39;s you it&#39;s
the way in which you stop repeating
those two words over and over again it&#39;s
the way in which you stop believing them
it&#39;s you the University lecturer
offering more scholarships to refugees
it&#39;s you the resident swapping Dutch
lessons for Hamas and stories about
things you couldn&#39;t even imagine it&#39;s
you the student making more friends
harnessing that opportunity to learn
something about a culture that is not
your own it&#39;s you each and every one of
you leaving this room today and no
longer feeling indifferent because when
you start to realize that this crisis is
made up of individuals you will see that
we
that we cannot continue to blind
ourselves to it those human rights abuse
it&#39;s happening because we have been
manipulated into thinking that there is
no other option speak out against them I
am Telling You there is another option
