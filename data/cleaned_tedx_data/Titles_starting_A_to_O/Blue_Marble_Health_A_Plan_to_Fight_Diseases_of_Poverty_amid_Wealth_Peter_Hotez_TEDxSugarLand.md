well I really do appreciate everybody
staying to the end it&#39;s a beautiful
Saturday I know you have other things to
do but it&#39;s really kind of you to stay
here and listen to what I have to say
about diseases of the poor so I&#39;m a
pediatrician and a scientist I lead the
tropical medicine school at Baylor
College of Medicine where I also lead an
institute making vaccines for the
poorest of the poor we make the vaccines
for poverty related diseases that no one
else wants to make because they only
affect people living in poverty and
today I want to tell you a story about
the opportunity to make interventions
for the world&#39;s poorest people and I&#39;m
gonna end by a very surprising twist to
what we found we&#39;ve just found recently
so I&#39;m gonna go through some slides and
the titles called Blue Marble health
I&#39;ll explain what that is an innovative
plan to fight diseases of poverty amid
wealth and we&#39;re gonna start here which
is go back to the year 2000 where that
when when the first big effort was made
to do something about the plight of
people who live in poverty the term at
that time was called the bottom billion
there were a billion people in the world
that lived on no money lived on less
than a dollar a day and all global
leaders came to United Nations
headquarters and said we&#39;re gonna do
something about this and they launched
these goals called the Millennium
Development Goals now I&#39;m not a big fan
of United Nations documents I think most
of them are forgotten about as quickly
as they&#39;re drafted but this one stuck
and it provided a framework for massive
interventions particularly for this goal
number six to combat hiv/aids malaria
and other diseases it led to the
creation of PEPFAR anybody know what
PEPFAR stands for want to bold enough to
say it the President&#39;s Emergency Plan
for AIDS relief it was created by george
w bush&#39;s and his administration to put
millions of people in africa and asia on
antiretroviral drugs for their HIV AIDS
it created the president&#39;s malaria
initiative to put people and give
provide anti malarial bed nets and anti
malarial drugs the idea
these diseases both occurred in the
setting of poverty but they also trap
people in poverty so this was a very
effective framework for poverty
reduction it also created the Global
Fund to fight AIDS they had the
tuberculosis and malaria now there was
one problem with this anybody see a
problem with with any of that any of the
language over here other diseases boy
that generated a lot of excitement
didn&#39;t it right you really see yes you
know you all we saw Brett Brad and
Angelina standing up there saying other
diseases right there her bra no of
course nothing was happening so those of
us who worked on other diseases said we
have to do something about this and we
actually engage in a branding exercise
where we actually labeled them the
neglected tropical diseases and it
referred to a group and I&#39;ll show you
the list in a little bit our original
list had 13 tropical infections that are
highly prevalent among the poor endemic
in rural areas of low income countries
their ancient afflictions afflicted
humankind for century chronic and
disabling conditions highly stigmatizing
and very important both occur in the
setting of poverty and they caused
poverty I even wrote of to raise
awareness even wrote a book about these
diseases which my kids call dad&#39;s
forgotten book on forgotten people with
forgotten diseases as as only as only
loving kids can do alright so so what is
that list that list here it is I don&#39;t
look too closely to numbers just be in
shock and awe at the numbers 799 million
people with ascariasis what is it let&#39;s
ask her eyes isn&#39;t talked about
neglected disease the most common
affliction of people living in poverty
800 million people haven&#39;t nobody knows
what it is it&#39;s intestinal roundworm
infection so a lot of these are wormy
diseases so hookworm diseased 450
million whipworm malaria schistosomiasis
scabies dengue foodborne tremor toad
infection I could say faster than any
one lymphatic filariasis onchocerciasis
Auguste easily psoriasis there&#39;s our
friend Zika and the list goes on every
single person on the planet living in
extreme poverty is infected with one or
more of these diseases and often often
they&#39;ll have all four or five of the
ones at the top of the list all at the
same time there
they&#39;re chronically in fact let me give
you an example of one of these looks
like now many of these are not killer
diseases
they&#39;re just debilitating infections so
here&#39;s one of them lymphatic filariasis
anybody remember how many were infected
little quiz there let&#39;s go back twenty
nine point four million people in the
world this is not a rare disease
he says it&#39;s quite a problem for me when
I have to stand at work for long periods
he&#39;s too sick to work in the fields to
support his family so as a result this
disease traps his entire family in
poverty it&#39;s called emphatic phyla
rias&#39;s the nether name is elephantiasis
is neglected tropical disease so here&#39;s
what we did we do it academics do we
when I say we I mean myself and two
colleagues Alan fennec at Imperial
College London and David Mullen you who
had to deliver Poole School of Tropical
Medicine he was like my equivalent on
the other side of the Atlantic we wrote
these two back-to-back papers in the
public library science first creating
the term neglected tropical diseases
second talking about how we can bundle
the top four or five with a package of
medicines that the drug companies were
willing to donate for free such that we
could treat and ultimately prevent a lot
of these diseases for $0.50 a person per
year so practically free but then what
do you do so what do you do as an
academic as an academic you write the
paper and you write the paper so you can
get a grant and you get the grant so you
can write more papers and you write
those paper so you can get more grants
so you can write more papers and get
more grants but the idea of then being
an advocate being a champion being out
there doing public engagement is not
something in our DNA the problem is you
know we didn&#39;t have Brad Pitt and
Angelina actually talked to Brad Pitt
about this and he was really the true
the real secret real truth breath is a
really nice man
but he&#39;s very busy and got other things
to do so we had to do it ourselves and
at that time I was chairman of the
microbiology department at George
Washington University just a few blocks
from the White House and I would get
into a taxi and go down to the executive
office building of the White House or
the congressional offices and talk to
people about this opportunity and hope
not to get arrested and and and and
I didn&#39;t get arrested people were
interested which goes to show you that
if you&#39;re a subject matter expert and
you&#39;re passionate you can really make a
big difference and ultimately we got 15
million dollars appropriated through
USAID for this package of interventions
so at 50 cents a person per year how
many people can we treat 30 30 million
people in principle there&#39;s a little bit
of things like overhead to take off of
things like that but close to it w the
World Health Organization has just
announced that 1 billion people have
received these treatments 10 years later
so we were able to get a billion people
treated and the International Business
Times wrote this article how three
scientists marketed it was a marketing
exercise neglected tropical diseases and
raised more than a billion dollar so it
really goes to show now we&#39;re seeing big
drops and the prevalence of these
diseases to the point we could talk
about eliminating them as a public
health problem but then something
happens so we&#39;ve made all these great
inroads about the diseases of the
poorest people in Africa and other parts
of Asia but it&#39;s like peeling away the
layers of an onion and then when you
peeled away that first layer when we
redid our analysis ten years later the
world had changed and what we found and
this is what I really want to talk to
you about today is something which is
very counterintuitive and that is most
of the world&#39;s and neglected tropical
diseases today are not necessarily in
the poorest most devastated countries of
Africa they&#39;re in the g20 countries what
are the g20 countries top 20 growth
countries the 20 largest economies plus
nigeria nigeria is actually not
officially a g20 country but it hasn&#39;t
economy bigger than the bottom three or
four so the top 21
so the poorest the does the greatest
impact of poverty related diseases are
in the 20 wealthiest economies well how
can that be well it&#39;s the poor among
living among the wealthy or what I
sometimes call the poorest of the rich
that now account for those neglected
tropical diseases and the poor are and
they account for together I&#39;ll show you
some examples on the right half the
world&#39;s worm infections
most of the leishmaniasis tuberculosis
dang
Chagas disease leprosy and with a few
exceptions the list goes on and on but
it&#39;s there but so when you look at a new
map of global health it looks like
something like this it&#39;s not your
father&#39;s global health
comparing the developed countries versus
the developing countries what I&#39;m
showing you are the pockets of intense
poverty and disease across the g20
countries anybody concerned about this
over here but we&#39;ll come back to that
but let&#39;s let me give you another let me
give you an example so let&#39;s look at
Brazil
okay so Brazil and the wealthiest
economy in Latin America but you go into
northeastern Brazil and you go back in
time 50 years and and that probably
explains why Zika virus infection for
instance arose out of the northeastern
cities in Brazil the slums of his cfa&#39;
of Salvador da Bahia because it&#39;s also
the same place where Brazil&#39;s
schistosomiasis is found or its leprosy
or its leishmaniasis or Shaka&#39;s disease
this is the global hotspot of of
neglected tropical diseases among the
poor living in the wealthiest economy in
Brazil so what is it about poverty
that&#39;s doing this well let&#39;s look cuz no
one really knows what what about this
picture scream zika at you standing
water what are the quality of the houses
so this is transmitted by the Aedes
aegypti mosquito that likes to go in and
out of houses right so now they can go
to so low quality dwellings 80s a gypped
I loves crowding any crowding here yeah
maybe a little bit so this explains why
Zika Rose of all the places in the world
that arose out of through this concept
of what we call blue marble health and I
call the blue marble health to
distinguish it from the typical norms of
global health to really reflect on the
picture that the Apollo astronauts took
of the Earth orbiting the moon and they
said it looks just like a big blue
marble and it&#39;s become a symbol for
peace and healing okay now where Zika go
where did she could go from there well
it went north up into the poorest parts
of Mexico
now what about Texas
does Texas have poverty well that&#39;s not
necessarily what was said in Washington
they said don&#39;t worry there&#39;s no people
you don&#39;t have that level of poverty in
the United States and everybody has air
conditioning
well what they fail to realize is we
have 20 million Americans that live at
half the u.s. poverty level and
according to the University of Michigan
center for poverty we have one point six
five million families in the United
States living on less than $2 a day and
most of them are concentrated along the
Gulf Coast states Texas Louisiana
Mississippi Alabama and Florida so let&#39;s
go look what do we see let&#39;s take a
little let&#39;s take a little glimpse of
what some of the poorest regions of
Texas look like so here are the colonias
on the border standing water 80s gypped
I loves nothing more than piles of old
tires that&#39;s its that&#39;s 80s gypped I
heaven so that&#39;s what we have here but
even here in Houston and though and we
and you know these neighborhoods when
you drive into the fifth Ward into
aldeen in to Sunnyside into Acres home
we have that level of poverty inadequate
housing discarded tires so we now
estimate that of the five million Texas
Texans who live in poverty about three
million of them live with a neglected
tropical disease now they&#39;re not
necessarily the same ones that we can
see in sub-saharan Africa their diseases
such as sharkus disease which is
transmitted by kissing bugs or toxic or
Isis a parasitic infection acquired from
dogs where the worms actually will
migrate through the brains of little
kids living in poverty and cause
developmental delays but the problem is
the problem that I&#39;m really facing is
getting the word out you know when we
had I had all this you know I had an N
of one I had this enormous success
convincing the world together with my
colleagues that we needed to treat the
bottom billion for their neglected
tropical diseases in in places like
sub-saharan Africa and it worked we got
a billion people on treatment I said
hell we&#39;ve got 12 million Americans in
total I estimate living with a neglected
tropical disease 303 million of them in
Texas I&#39;ll blow the roof off right the
people will really rally around this and
the and the answer was the opposite
happened nobody wanted to do a thing
about it it was it was though I had sort
of revealed some kind of Inconvenient
Truth to use the Al Gore language there
the the level of neglect was
extraordinary we&#39;re finally now working
a little bit with gene Greene who&#39;s a
congressman from from Texas together
with Chris Smith from New Jersey in
query book or a senators now to
introduce a new legislation because
we&#39;re not doing any efforts to do active
surveillance for these diseases so the
number that I&#39;ve come up with with 12
million is still a rough estimate and
now what we&#39;re trying to do is we making
when I came to Texas the idea was six
years ago to the Texas Medical Center it
was to make vaccines for hookworm and
schistosomiasis and other diseases
affecting the poor now we&#39;re turning our
attention inward we&#39;re actually making a
chaga disease vaccine and not trying to
make vaccines for the poorest people in
Texas so I think I&#39;ll end here by saying
Elie Wiesel once said the opposite of
love is not hate its indifference the
opposite of art is not ugliness its
indifference the opposite of faith is
not heresy its indifference in the
opposite of life is not death its
indifference and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got
to overfit out how to overcome for this
next wave of neglected tropical diseases
affecting the poor in the u.s. so thank
you so much
[Applause]
