I&#39;ve always played a lot of sports from
cheerleading to swimming to baseball to
basketball they always have been and
continue to be a huge part of my life
this was thanks to my parents who since
I was very young put me in basically
every sport imaginable but I&#39;m thankful
for it and I think it shows because to
this day in our house sports are part of
daily life and when you have three
siblings your parents often try to see
if they can have more than one child
playing on the same teams which often
meant that my brother who is one year
younger than me and I played together on
the same teams some people find this
strange but I&#39;m not sure why when I run
track or swim I trained the boys and
girls so I should baseball or basketball
be any different
all kids care about is if you can play
if you&#39;re good a hard worker and willing
to be competitive boys will play against
you just like any other guy in over ten
years of playing sports I&#39;ve never felt
that boy didn&#39;t want to play with me or
against me
because of my gender there probably is a
crazy sports parent&#39; talk in here
somewhere about my wife and I you know
we&#39;ve been driving and coaching and
cheering from the sidelines as our four
kids have been growing up and we never
really thought of this notion of gender
of being important we were just trying
to get our kids in a range of activities
and we&#39;ve been really surprised by how
it seems to have struck other parents
really differently parents do seem to
get all caught up in gender I grew up in
a house of with just brothers and none
and in during all of our sports
experiences I don&#39;t think we ever had a
time where we had girls on our teams but
actually things have changed and it was
probably not right then and it&#39;s
definitely not right now they&#39;re not
finding ways for girls and boys to be
playing together in almost all
activities there seems to be this notion
that we&#39;re protecting both boys and
girls but I&#39;m not really sure what
exactly it is we&#39;re protecting them from
and then also at what cost are we doing
it it&#39;s interesting to see the reactions
of other parents as our kids have been
playing as our kids are playing sports
and especially watching Liz play with
her younger brother this is no great
bold political statement we were trying
to make as Elizabeth went and played
with her brother who was a year younger
as all of you know often sports are
arranged in these two-year brackets and
as she said you know we
I was really out of convenience that we
ended up having our son and our daughter
play sports together but hearing some of
the comments were really surprising
there are those who said wow what a bold
powerful statement you&#39;re making you
know having girls plate you having your
daughter play with a boys team I
actually never really understood that
sports are just about kids having fun it
wasn&#39;t like we were trying to create any
political statement by what we were
doing but more concerning were some of
the other comments that I heard from
parents those comments like I&#39;m really
worried the girls are going to get hurt
if they play with the boys as though
somehow a five-year-old girls body is
far more breakable than a five-year-old
boys body or comments like you know I
think it&#39;s great what&#39;s happening but
I&#39;m kind of worried about what some of
the other parents might be thinking or I
do remember one in particular who was
who who said you know this is just
outrageous this is such discrimination
against all those boys by allowing a
girl to play on the team and those are
just a sampling and I have to tell you
those actually aren&#39;t the worst comments
the worst comments are those kind of
comments that I know in some circles get
dismissed as locker room talk but are
things that were never in vogue 30 or 40
years ago and the things that actually
shouldn&#39;t be thought said or thought
about today it&#39;s clear that that parents
and to be fair both dads and moms are
carrying over some of their views of the
of growing up in the 60s 70s and 80s and
then their their experiences in playing
sports and they&#39;re carrying them over
into their adulthood
and to being parents today just this
past spring an all-girls soccer team
from Spain with players around 13 years
old when a 14 team boys League when the
idea came around for this girls team to
play in this league the girl&#39;s parents
were a little skeptical they were
worried that their girls might get hurt
by the boys the girls knew that wasn&#39;t
true they convince them otherwise
so they went ahead and played in the
league and they received a lot of
criticism from the coaches of the other
teams the referees and the boys parents
there was one group that didn&#39;t really
seem to care and that was the boys
they&#39;re playing against the boys knew
they were getting good games against a
really good team and most importantly
everyone was having
fun and yes of course we still need
girls only sports we have particular
issues with girls getting and staying
active and sometimes girl single gender
opportunities can make them feel safe
that&#39;s why you should have co-ed and
girls only are young ages girls can be
and are just as competitive as boys so
there might be the odds for exception
but I&#39;m not sure why we need any boy
sports and then when it comes to
organizing teams there are so many other
ways to do it than by gender young ages
the girls often and almost always are
just as big and strong as boys of the
same age so why not sort by size how
about skills that everyone regardless of
gender is appropriately challenged what
about age what school they go to or who
their friends are
why do we always sort to jump to sorting
by gender when there are so many other
options we could explore in sports like
swimming and track there are ways we can
integrate more mixed gender relays that
promote gender integration by having
girls and boys competing together we
have come a long way recently in the
last generation are thinking of girls
girls were to grow up and become nurses
and boys were too comfy to grow up to
become the doctors we shifted thinking
from the idea that men were the ones who
worked outside the home and women were
the ones whose responsibility was to
take care of the home and then in more
recent years we&#39;ve had dramatic shifts
in views from homosexuality to more
recently transgendered persons that has
shifted our thinking from everything
from bathrooms to marriage but we&#39;re
still holding on to some very dated
views on some aspects when it comes to
gender and the argument isn&#39;t that we
should never think about gender when it
comes to sports absolutely by the time
kids hit puberty we do need to be more
thoughtful about how we organize boys
and girls but until about the age of
twelve it&#39;s hard to find many examples
of where we shouldn&#39;t allow boys and
girls to be playing together it&#39;s hard
to argue that five and six year olds
shouldn&#39;t share the same soccer field
hockey rink or basketball court the only
reason that we sin can&#39;t continue to do
this is because we&#39;ve always done it
this way and so we need to take that on
because there are far better ways to
begin to think about how we organize
sports have the ability to send powerful
strong messages
that powerful strong message that we
want to be sent is not that a girl
playing on a boy sports team is some
bold political powerful statement what
we want the message to be is well that&#39;s
just the waiting of the norm that&#39;s just
how we do things and while we&#39;re at it
well we do some of this we&#39;ll begin to
tackle some of the really clear sexism
that still exists everywhere from
amateur to professional sports if we can
remove gender tags from sports at a
young age that&#39;s at least a ripple in
what is still is still something that we
rarely talk about and still we still
hold views from twenty thirty forty or a
hundred years ago in many ways when we
think about sports I&#39;m happy to play
like a girl
and I will do it proudly when what was
seen as an insult when my mom was
growing up is now often a compliment as
proof that our world is changing for the
better and youth sports can help speed
up that process when I&#39;m told I throw
like a girl or run like a girl or play
like a girl I say thank you what if
instead of boys soccer boys hockey and
boys baseball
we just had soccer hockey and baseball
since when does the gender define the
sport this could have a huge impact
beyond just these sports moms dads
if you run leagues organize teams listen
to your sons they don&#39;t care that I&#39;m a
girl like me your son&#39;s just want to
play the sport they love everyone wants
to get better and have a lot of fun in
the process so let&#39;s get on with it
thank you
