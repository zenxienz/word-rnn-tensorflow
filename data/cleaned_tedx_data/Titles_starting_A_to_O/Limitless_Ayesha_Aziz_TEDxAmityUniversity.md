hello everybody Thank You team TEDx
Amity University for concentrate
considering me worthy in the capacity of
a speaker on this platform I had never
imagined that I would be standing in a
place where I had seen some of the most
influential people come and speak and
that too when I&#39;m just 21 years old I
would be sharing a little bit of my
journey in aviation how I innovated
aviation and then speaking of little
about the change of waves so as the
saying goes by jalaluddin rumi you were
born with wings why preferred to crawl
through life I think I took it way too
seriously when he said that and when I
was 15 years old I invaded aviation and
I decided to give wings to my career as
kids we all have role models we all have
heroes we all have we all admire we have
somebody as an idol to whom we aspire to
become when we when we grow big unlike
many of them
I was never faster a turd towards the
glamour side towards the glam industry
and for me my role models were always
pilots or astronauts and I think as kids
we all we all want to become pilots and
astronauts but unfortunately for some of
them it remains slam Samberg bounded and
not many of us are able to achieve that
as we grow big having my maternal roots
from Kashmir traveling became quite
often and every being the medium through
which I would commute often and I
fascinated a great amount of love for
traveling I discovered that I love
traveling and I want to do something
which involves into the zone of
traveling and in that period I realized
that I wanted to I wanted to figure out
how and who as a person I am my likes my
dislikes I wanted to know what what is
it that I love to do the most what is it
that I don&#39;t like doing because I wanted
to figure out that
ever filled I pick up whatever I work if
I love it it&#39;s never going to be work
so with that motive I I decided to
explore myself I wanted to know my my
likes and dislikes and I I realized I
comprehended to the fact that I love
change I want to change in my life
constant changes be it a change of place
be it a change of culture places I love
socializing I love meeting new people
and I like learning new languages
and I wanted to be wealthy wealthy not
by material but wealthy by the knowledge
by wealthy with knowledge and
[Music]
experiences and understanding and I knew
that I would never do good if I would
have a desk job from nine to five and I
knew at that point that I need my work
station to be somewhere at 38,000 feet
with a cup of coffee in my hand and the
world down at my feet with with the best
office in the world providing a
panoramic view allow me to take you six
years back in time when I was 15 years
old when I actually initiated and gave
wings to my career I enrolled myself in
the Flying Club and it was then that I
was attending five days of my elementary
school whilst the two days of the
weekends I would be taking my flying
lessons and while my friends would be
busy executing their weekend plans and
binging on hamburgers and pizza I would
be I would be working for something that
tantalized me the most because the heart
wanted what it wanted and it was then
that I stepped and I stepped and I
invaded the new outlandish gates of
something which I had absolutely no idea
of and in my batch I realized that we
were six of us and I was
first I was the only female in that
batches coming from a convent school
with an absolute girl&#39;s background I I
did not know how would I do how would I
go ahead and with absolutely no fear I
think I stepped in stepped into the new
phase of my life after and it was that
phase where I did not even know this was
a batch and I did not even know my my
batch which were so senior that I
contemplated if I should be addressing
them as so or I should be addressing
them as uncle&#39;s because had I been
anywhere outside my airfield probably if
I would bump 1 and 2 or if I would bump
into them I might have said uncle but
here now that I was encompassed within
the boundary of professionalism I was
contemplating of what or how should I be
addressing them a couple of months later
after my exams student pilot license
exams were done and I had cleared it I
had got my tickets to my 1 to level my
my first license my first flying license
and a couple of maybe two months or one
month later I had the opportunity of of
having of doing my first flight it was
when I was 16 years old and I had the
privilege of flying my parents on board
I think no no feeling in the world could
ever beat that feeling and my student
pilot&#39;s license was the best gift I
could have ever given myself as a sweet
16th birthday gift this was when I was
16 years old just before my flight I
think and in the cockpit and and a month
later it so happened that I had the
opportunity of visiting NASA something
that I had always dreamt of and as a
child I remember when I was in sixth
grade
while we were dining at the back on the
television it was Sunita Williams going
ahead with her first expedition and I
remember the space shuttle was about to
blast off in the cup
of seconds 3 2 1 it said I turned I
turned my head back on the TV and I I
told my dad I talked to myself that if
ever I could be in that place if ever I
would have an opportunity to visit
States to visit NASA and meet Sunita
Williams or pursue a career in space
little did I know that my dreams were
turning into reality when I was 16 years
old I had the opportunity of visiting
States for astronaut training and we did
multiple things we underwent training we
learned what an astronaut goes through
before they go into the space we did
multiple activities this being
multi-access training in which we are
spun and the astronaut astronaut her
acclimatized to the space environment
and that&#39;s that is how fast it was 360
degree deuce to spin and we did we were
into the water scuba diving bunny works
moon works and microgravity activities
facing the negative g-forces the space
shot in which we actually felt how the
astronauts feel when they are when they
take off in the space shuttle and this
wasn&#39;t the ISS when we were performing
the experiment wearing the blue suit I
had only seen astronauts wearing that
and I I could I couldn&#39;t fathom that it
was actually me putting it on with all
the spaceships the little souvenirs that
we had on that NASA and that&#39;s that&#39;s
the wing only only an aviator would
realize this the importance of that wing
it probably means everything to an
aviator and that is exactly what it
meant by that time this was the first
wing that I had earned and what what
makes it all the more specialist it was
from NASA I think nothing more could
mean that to someone who&#39;s always dreamt
of flying and that was the that was in
the math so an ordinary day at NASA
would wouldn&#39;t actually be ordinary ever
because we would start our morning by 5

o&#39;clock our breakfast would be at 7:00

lunch would be at 11:00 and dinner would

be somewhere somewhere at around 4:00

4:00 p.m. in the evening and that is how
the days at NASA would be thankfully I
had some good new friends along and we
used to survive in the night by eating
dough clubs and for flowers and Cockrell
and that is how we used to survive there
because if someone who has lived in
Bombay would probably know how nocturnal
one is the night lives in Bombay and
that is again at NASA we were probably
going to perform the experiment in the
dummy Space Station that they had made
and we used to be fixing satellites and
that&#39;s good to go sign wearing the
astronaut suit so this was all about my
journey how it happened and how I got
into how drastic the changes were just
in a couple of months I think all that
was needed for me was to become 16 and
then things just kept happening in a row
through these doors enter America&#39;s
future astronaut scientists and
engineers
I think this remains my most favorite
picture until now and that was when a
single bar when I had started into
aviation and the same by Paul Coelho and
it goes if there&#39;s something that you
desire in the world the universe
conspires help you get it I think it
started becoming so relatable because
everything that I had dreamt of I kept
achieving it one by one one by one
touchwood and after this this is I WPA
Indian women Pilots Association being
the youngest member to it and then came
the glorious day in the year 2017 when I
owned my commercial pilot&#39;s license a
lot of hurdles sleepless nights
innumerable obstacles and whatnot and I
had this little booklet in my hand which
I had always dreamt of since illa since
my childhood it it actually was the
Weiser now I had the ticket
I had the Weiser and I had my wings to
give courier to my dreams for real
having the journey wasn&#39;t really easy
for me had to face a lot of obstacles a
lot of barriers cross them while giving
exams I realized how difficult it was to
become a pilot initially we have we have
around six subjects when we think of
becoming a pilot and in school we would
have somewhere around eight to nine
subjects on average on total and when I
invaded aviation when I was in the face
of giving my exams after my twelve
standard I thought I&#39;m going to nail
every every paper in a shot and I&#39;m
going to crack it because I had eight
subjects in school if I could clear them
then six are nothing but only to realize
that how tough it was and every paper so
so different than the other one
absolutely no idea of what it is like
and there were days when I when I lost
hope I thought I am I maybe I&#39;m not I&#39;m
not going to reach that however I&#39;ve
always dreamt to be and I thought that I
would give up but somewhere somewhere
deep down I knew with all this patients
with all this efforts time there awaits
a reward which was going to be so
fruitful that once I have it I&#39;m going
to know maybe the journey want what the
journey won&#39;t even be as difficult as it
seemed this picture was somewhat taken
in 1960s it&#39;s
mrs. Rabia Fatali she was one of the
first one of the youngest pilots in
India to own a private pilot license
with the license number being 13 and she
flew in 1960s where definitely it wasn&#39;t
even now when people are so skeptical of
taking aviation as a courier because
they think of all the problem
possibilities the risk factors and and
of course that women are women wouldn&#39;t
do so well in the society so needless to
say that the amount of struggle she must
have faced faced in that time when she
got into aviation in 1960s men shorts
and trousers weren&#39;t even introduced as
uniforms this picture it&#39;s me standing
next to mrs. Rabia Vitali and I think
the picture enough speaks of how drastic
the change has been an aviation Aviation
has grown leaps and bounds from what it
was to what it is now and aviation
industry having from if you see from the
the technology point of view it has come
a very long way initially everything
everything in the cockpit would be
manual from the tick off to the landing
the monitoring everything even now it is
it is pilot there&#39;s a lot of the usual
excuse me there&#39;s a huge role of a pilot
but things have modernized things have
changed advancement has come into the
picture
and back then not having many things
which we have now seeing that to cast
the GPWS vor ILS some of these things
which are in the in the cockpit and
things have come things have grown to
such an extent
now human interference has got less in
order to in order to assure safety
hundred-percent safety and the duties of
a pilot to aviate navigate and
communicate these three things still
remain as the main motive the safety
still remains as a main goal of a pilot
and speaking from the change it&#39;s been
it&#39;s been tremendous initially initially
women weren&#39;t so weren&#39;t taking this as
a career and globally there are around
eleven point three percent of population
which constitutes two pilot against
which three percent are female pilots in
the world and in India luckily we have a
very good ratio of women invading the
field of aviation people are getting
over the myth that only males can do it
there are so many females taking up that
it just feels so proud to be a part of
that field which is male-dominated but
there are a number of females in Waiting
it with with a vision to make it a field
with balanced ratio between both males
and females and that&#39;s my dad the
real-life commander I think without him
I wouldn&#39;t have come this long I
wouldn&#39;t have come to where I am right
now
when the society said no it was him who
said yes and he left me give career give
wings to my dreams he let me persuade
what I wanted and yeah and my journey he
wasn&#39;t really a journey of bed of roses
but a lot of trials a lot of challenges
ordeals which I had to face where I
stand today I think if I wouldn&#39;t have
faced it I wouldn&#39;t be standing right
in front of you had it not been those
trials and challenges I wouldn&#39;t be as
strong as I am
today we we all have failures in our
lifes regrets mistakes we all are going
to have it but I think what we should be
focusing on is what&#39;s next in our life
because what is gone has gone what is
done is done we can&#39;t really do much
about it and even despite that if you
think that you can&#39;t really go ahead you
you can&#39;t really do well just remember
what Henry Ford said when everything
seems to be going against you remember
that an airplane takes off against the
wind and not with it on that note I
would just like to thank you guys for
having me your thank you team TEDx for
considering me worthy in the next four
days I would be turning a year older and
I think I couldn&#39;t have any better
gateway to my birthday than being on the
podium of TEDx and welcoming my birthday
[Applause]
