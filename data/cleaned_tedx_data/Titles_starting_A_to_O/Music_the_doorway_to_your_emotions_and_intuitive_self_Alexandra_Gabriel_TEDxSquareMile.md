my name is Alexandra Gabriel and I&#39;m a
new-age musician and composer and I&#39;m
here just to shift the energy and bring
the whole thing to a close so I just
wanted to also extend my thanks to the
organizers and the speakers it&#39;s been a
really inspirational day to sit sit
through had to be lost
someone has to be lost so I&#39;m going to
do a very very short tiny introduction
about why I perform music and then I&#39;m
going to sing something to you and then
we&#39;ll bring the day to a close so when I
was at university I was identified as
having severe learning difficulties and
disabled because of my inability to
learn and understand concepts that
traditional teaching methods needed me
to conform to but that being said I was
in one sense of the word highly
successful I left school with high
grades and a first class honours degree
it&#39;s not a new concept that a
one-size-fits-all education system is
challenging for our students teachers
and development as a country we&#39;ve been
having this conversation for some time
and the labeling of students and those
around us can have a negative and
seperating impact rather than creating
these supportive and unified
environments of learning my brain
operates in a unique way and whose
doesn&#39;t and although I honor and thank
my many great teachers I believe we all
ultimately have the responsibility to
make this world make sense for ourselves
so how did music helped me and how can
it help you well music is one of the
only activities which stimulates your
entire brain the brain of a musician is
noticeably larger and more symmetrical
in an education environment music is
totally encompassing everybody can be
involved and nobody needs to be left out
but the real ultimate benefit of music
that I want to share with you today is
that it connects you with your heart
emotions and more intuitive brain to me
what it means to be human
in that space we make decisions very
differently
and our digitalized world can be taking
away this need to feel from us with a
OneTouch solution to our uncomfortable
feelings and problems in our reality
emotions and emotional intelligence
require us to connect to our hearts and
when our day-to-day lives does not
necessarily ask us to step into that
space or into that role then music can
be that doorway to help you to do that
I know for myself that when I&#39;m busy
doing all day it&#39;s challenging for me to
walk through the door at home and go
into a space of receptivity with those I
love around me taking moments to be and
not to do not only bring us greater
spiritual connection but also stillness
and inner peace I write music to take
people into that space for a moment so

I&#39;m going to invite you at 2:00 at the
end of this day today I&#39;m just gonna
move this mics time before I start if
you would please and allow yourself just
to go into a sort of state of stillness
closing your eyes and relaxing what&#39;s I
performed to you a piece of music from
my album unconditional

hope you&#39;ll enjoyed that experience
thank you so much for listening
[Applause]
