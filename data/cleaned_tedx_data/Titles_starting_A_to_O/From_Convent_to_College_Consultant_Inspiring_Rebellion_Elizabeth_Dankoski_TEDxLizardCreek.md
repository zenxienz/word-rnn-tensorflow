do you remember when you were 17 years
old
remember when you were at the end of
your high school career sitting in those
cramped little desks listening to your
teachers drone on and on did you have
any idea that a bridge existed between
you in that classroom and the rest of
your life did you have any idea that you
could actually build that bridge I
didn&#39;t either in fact when I was 17 I
was pulled out of high school and sent
to a convent in the middle of my senior
year sounds rather medieval doesn&#39;t it
but in the small Christian commune where
I grew up it was actually fairly normal
from the time my friends and I were
little girls we were taught that
becoming a nun was the highest calling
so even though I was shocked to find
myself in the middle of this convent
it&#39;s such a young age I wasn&#39;t really
that surprised now I was one of the good
girls and it never occurred to me that I
could actually do anything about being
sent to this convent like say no my
whole life it had been drilled into me
that if I didn&#39;t follow God&#39;s will for
my life I was going straight to hell on
the streets addicted to drugs maybe an
alcoholic certainly a whore
so when mother Betty called me on
Christmas Eve to tell me that it was
God&#39;s will that I entered the convent
that night it didn&#39;t occur to me to say
no in my mind that would have been
saying yes to a life of unspeakable
horror and shame so the commune where I
had grown up had always insisted on
unquestioning obedience but the convent
took this idea of openness to a whole
new level everything was decided for me
down to the food that I put on my plate
if I made the mistake of skipping the
kielbasa in the buffet line several nuns
would suddenly appear and stand over me
until I finished every last bite
so in order to survive I had to be quiet
and do what I was told but from the very
beginning my body was sending me signals
this isn&#39;t going to work I was assigned
to work in the kitchen and all day long
I pulled these sheet metal pans in and
out of the ovens and I was always
forgetting to use the pot holders so I
had these burns on my hands up and down
my arms and I was constantly in pain I
couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on
why am I always burning myself I was
also responsible for defrosting all of
the food for the next day&#39;s meals for 80
sisters this meant walking into the
walk-in freezer and hauling out 20-pound
logs of Turkey or 50-pound crate of
chicken legs and I was supposed to do
this every night before I went to bed
but I&#39;d forget no merit matter how many
post-it notes I stuck on my prayer book
I&#39;d still forget so every night I crawl
into bed exhausted drifting off to sleep
and suddenly a jerk awake
oh no the freezer I&#39;d leap out of my
bunk pull on my long beige skirt over my
flannel nightgown and go tearing across
the lawn to see if I could make it to
the building before they locked it for
the night night after night this
happened and I couldn&#39;t figure out what
was going on why can&#39;t I remember
anything I seem to be in a daze even
tripping over my own feet the convent
had these four and a half foot window
wells all around the perimeter of the of
the building I can&#39;t tell you how many
times I fell into one of these window
wells with my cello while I was walking
to one of these Orchestra rehearsals I
was never hurt and neither was my cello
but I couldn&#39;t figure out what was going
on why am I always falling well my body
was sending me signals this isn&#39;t
working
this isn&#39;t you wake up but I couldn&#39;t
hear and the longer I stayed there the
more my body screamed by the end of four
years I was literally shaking with
pent-up rage sitting in the sewing room
bent over an old singer
gene or you know vacuuming the green
tiled stairwells I could barely contain
it and I didn&#39;t know what was going on
with his shaking all I knew is that it
was getting harder and harder to silence
myself well as strange as it may sound
to you and to me too frankly it never
occurred to me that I could actually
leave oh really that I wanted to but one
day I was found myself standing in the
middle of France on a mission trip and
one of the nuns turned to me and she
said you know I see you at a crossroads
you could either leave or you could
either stay here and make you know the
convent your life or you could leave and
in that moment when she said you could
leave it was like a light bulb went on I
don&#39;t have to do this anymore so I went
back home and I found the courage to
leave everything behind the convent the
commune my family my friends everything
I&#39;d ever known and risk walking straight
into hell but I had to find out if it
was possible to create a life that
didn&#39;t require that I silenced myself
well despite all of the predictions
otherwise I didn&#39;t end up on the streets
or addicted to heroin instead I ended up
graduating from Wellesley College and
then going on to do my masters in
writing and along the way I discovered
that I not only had a gift for writing
but I had a gift for teaching writing so
by the time I graduated from college I
had this huge roster of students that I
was working with on their college
applications helping them express their
very best selves and really this was the
key to their applications this
celebration of who they were and what
their unique contributions were and
right away these students were getting
amazing results all of them getting into
some of the very best colleges in the
nation so looking at those results I
figured wow I found my calling helping
students recognize and express their
unique self
so a number of years went by and I found
myself working with the largest class of
seniors that I&#39;d ever worked with all of
these kids were incredible they had top
grades top SAT scores high level
extracurriculars accolades awards
captains of sports teams academic teams
everything everyone said that they
needed but something was wrong and it
started with the unbelievable levels of
stress that these kids were dealing with
they&#39;d show up to their sessions
literally shaking their knees are
bouncing up and down they can&#39;t look me
in the eye they&#39;re terrified they&#39;re not
going to get into a good enough college
that they&#39;re not good enough
so I&#39;m sitting next to them watching
this shaking and I start to have this
dawning recognition these students had
been given one path to success
just the way that I had been given one
path when I was sent to the convent
I started thinking no more this system
that takes these incredible kids and
shoves them down one path I&#39;ve got to do
something about this but what so a few
months later it&#39;s March and the flurry
of admissions letters are coming out and
despite all of the stress I&#39;m sure that
all of these amazing kids are going to
be getting into their top choice schools
they&#39;ll be jumping for joy but it turns
out that only two students were accepted
into their very top choice schools
everybody else what got into a good
school but when it came to their very
top choice schools almost everyone was
sent to the waitlist which meant they
were in limbo neither accepted nor
rejected just waiting for a spot to open
up what was going on why with their
incredible academic performance their
impressive resumes their beautiful
essays why weren&#39;t they getting accepted
what was going on with this waitlist
status and what was the point of all
this dress if it didn&#39;t even work well I
started to look very closely at these
students and particularly the students
who had gotten into their top choice
schools what did they do differently
that&#39;s when I began to see that these
students had all created something of
their own something that really lit them
up and changed their communities for the
better suddenly it was so clear to me
why these other students had all been
wait-listed they were too good on paper
to reject but they had nothing to
distinguish them from everybody else
well it got me thinking what if there
were a way to teach students to discover
what lights them up and then to create a
project that showcased this unique
interest and serves their communities in
a really meaningful way and as soon as
that idea took hold it was so easy to
see that creating a project like this
would radically change students high
school experience it would launch them
out of this old mode of passive
obedience and automatically just by
having a purpose and an excitement
plummet their stress and rocket their
joy they&#39;d start thriving instead of
surviving all because of the pride that
would come from knowing what their gifts
were and how to bring them to the world
and as a result they&#39;d also end up
increasing their chances of acceptance
at their top choice schools because they
become so compelling well the more I
thought about it the more obvious it was
that every student needed this to be
completely lit up with excitement at
their own gifts but the question was
what exactly created this excitement how
could students who&#39;d never really felt
much excitement about anything before
suddenly wake up to their interests and
as I began to look closely at this I
began to see that the the excitement
really popped
when students began to ask two questions
what lights me up and what problems do I
want to solve and then the next step was
once they&#39;d answer those questions was
to go out and build a bridge between the
thing that lit them up and the need that
they saw in their communities so that&#39;s
exactly what I started doing and the
projects these kids have built how are
incredible let me share some of the
results that I&#39;ve seen
I&#39;ll start with bane she was an
extraordinary young woman that I met
when she was a sophomore in high school
and when I met her she was really
struggling because of severe dyslexia
but she did not want to let that define
her so she started to ask these two
questions what lights me up and what
problems do I want to solve now as a
freshman she had joined her high
school&#39;s criminal justice program and
become incredibly passionate about it
she started to envision herself in a
career as an attorney but the fee to
join this program was out of reach for
many of her friends and she felt it was
unfair for them to be excluded from a
program that had lit her up so much and
given her so much hope about her future
so she decided that she would launch her
own nonprofit organization to raise
money for these kids and she went on to
pitch it to the Wharton School of
Business where she was the only teenager
out of 72 companies to be chosen to work
with them and shortly after that she
received $100,000 in her first
fundraising efforts and today she&#39;s in
the process of bringing this program to
schools all over the US now this is a
student whose dyslexia was so
debilitating that one teacher told her
she had a 50% chance of graduating high
school she could have just given up
but now she&#39;s thriving and in fact her
father called in tears to say he was now
at peace about his daughter&#39;s future and
isn&#39;t it this this discovery of who we
are and what lights us up and how to
bring our gifts to the world isn&#39;t this
that gives us the greatest pride and
happiness that&#39;s certainly the
experience that Alex had another high
school student or were the past year
just a year ago Alex was trudging home
from school every day and plopping
himself down in front of his computer to
play video games all afternoon he was
like so many high school students
grayed-out
uninspired just going through the
motions but also stress because of the
immense academic pressures
and the looming college applications but
Alex was getting fed up with this
situation he knew that he had so much
more to give than this so he started
asking these two questions what lights
me up and what problems do I want to
stop so he started looking around his
high school and recognizing that almost
everyone was feeling the same way that
he was and he wanted to find a way to
help them celebrate who they were to
really focus on what was great about
them rather than just focusing on the
grades and test scores now he had heard
about humans of New York which is a
project where this photographer in New
York City goes around the streets and
takes pictures of whoever he sees and in
the process of taking pictures he&#39;ll ask
his subjects about their lives and these
incredible stories come out well Alex
was so moved by these stories that he
decided he wanted to do something
similar so he started to go around his
high school and to ask students
questions like what&#39;s the coolest thing
you&#39;ve ever built what&#39;s the best thing
that&#39;s ever happened to you and just as
he&#39;d hoped story after story came
pouring out by the end of the year he&#39;d
done dozens of interviews and he&#39;s had
the opportunity to listen to students
really open up and share stories he
would normally never get to hear but
these interviews didn&#39;t just create a
connection for him they created a
connection for everyone involved the
students would say things like you have
no idea how much I needed that when he
was done so Alex decided to pull all of
these interviews together into a video
montage and he organized an end-of-year
celebration for his school where he
showcased all of these stories to a
standing ovation afterward Alex told me
that creating a project like this
changed him from someone who cared only
about pleasing others to everyday asking
himself how can I respect myself Wow now
that&#39;s when we feel incredible isn&#39;t it
when we respect ourselves now Alex was
17 years old when he created this
transformation
so remember your 17 year old self
what is back then you had asked yourself
these two questions what lights me up
and what problems do I want to solve do
you think that your life would be any
different today well what if you were to
ask those questions now what might you
learn what would you create what would
you build and this asking these kinds of
questions and helping students build
their bridges this has become my life&#39;s
work to help students find their light
so they can step out of those old tight
constricted places stop the shaking and
gift themselves the freedom to become
their very best selves and you know this
can feel frightening but it&#39;s so worth
it I know because I did it I walked away
from everything that told me to obey
that told me to be quiet that told me I
had nothing to give and it was
frightening like walking straight into
hell but when that light bulb went on
and I realized there was another path
it didn&#39;t just illuminate the way for me
it shone a light on how every one of us
can create our own path because I
believe that everyone every student
every individual every one of us has
something extraordinary to offer the
world and in this incredible innovation
era we need to rebell we need to teach
our kids to rebel against anything that
would have us believe otherwise so
together let&#39;s rise up from our cramped
deaths and break out of the old outdated
pathways of obedience so we can
transform ourselves and our communities
with our incredible gifts
