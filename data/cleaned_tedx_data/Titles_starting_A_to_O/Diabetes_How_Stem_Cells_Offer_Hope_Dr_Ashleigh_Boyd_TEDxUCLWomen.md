worldwide over 420 million people suffer
from diabetes now someone in the UK is
diagnosed with it every two minutes so
that&#39;s roughly by 700 people pair D so
that really means most of us in this
room will probably know someone who&#39;s
been affected by it one way or another
so it could be your selfish suffers from
it or a family member or a friend or a
work colleague now the reason why it&#39;s
such an issue is because it affects a
lot of the most vulnerable members of
our society
so children and adolescents pregnant
women and also the elderly and it really
places a large burden on our society and
the people who have to deal with this
illness particularly parents of children
with diabetes the elderly also brings a
lot of disability and it&#39;s lifelong
illness and those very young though as
well as also impacting the health of the
patients it also has a big impact on
their emotional well-being and what we
really need to think about as well as
trying to help them and meet their
medical needs with the disease and they
honest we also have to think about
having a support network there to help
them and it&#39;s even more important
because we consider than the next 20
years
these numbers are projected to increase
by over 200 million when we think about
in basic terms what is diabetes when we
eat food it is broken down in the
stomach into glucose and glucose as a
type of sugar that we use to fuel our
bodies it runs our tissues and cells in
the body and it&#39;s really found in many
different foods so indiri products
breads pasta fruits as well as obviously
direct sugars like cakes and and sweets
and from the
stomach the glucose then moves into the
blood system and from there it can
access the tissues and that&#39;s pervaded
that another organ called the pancreas
it&#39;s doing its job correctly because
inside the pancreas there are some cells
called B facilities are found in
clusters throughout the pancreas and
these secrete a hormone called insulin
which probably all heard of insulin well
insulin is very important because that
allows the glucose in the bloodstream to
actually access the tissues of the body
where it&#39;s needed so glucose plus
insulin healthy people and we&#39;re happy
with that but in patients that have
diabetes there&#39;s an issue with the
production of insulin or with insulin
it&#39;s actually is made it doesn&#39;t
function properly so in those cases
that&#39;s what causes their illness and
diabetes that buildup of glucose that is
unable to be used so when you think
about diabetes there are three major
types now type 1 diabetes is as more
unusual tape and it&#39;s formed when our
body&#39;s immune system attacks those beta
cells in the pancreas and it stops them
from making insulin now patients that
have type 1 diabetes have to monitor
their blood glucose very closely several
times a day and they also have to
replace that lost insulin by giving
themselves injections of the of the
insulin with type 2 diabetes on the
other hand it&#39;s the more common form
overall and it affects nine and ten
patients that&#39;s what we can set it to be
a disease of our metabolism so quite
often influence still need but it&#39;s not
made in a sufficient label to have an
effect and the patient can then become
quite ill because of that there are many
risk factors in diabetes there&#39;s a
genetic component that&#39;s involved and
for type 2 there are lots of other
factors as well so you could if you have
higher higher blood pressure for example
if you&#39;re overweight you&#39;re you&#39;re less
active but it&#39;s also patients that come
from certain ethnicities they&#39;re also
have a greater
risk for from developing it and also if
you&#39;re over the age of 40 so when you
take all those factors together it means
that some people are more likely to
develop diabetes than others
now the other format I mentioned
pregnant women earlier the other form
that affects those is what we call type
3 or gestational diabetes and that can
arise during pregnancy and it has an
impact on the the mother threat the
pregnancy but also it can mean that the
unborn child is more likely to go on and
develop type 2 diabetes and add altered
but I think what I wanted to show you
this just now is it&#39;s a very disturbing
statistic and it&#39;s something that people
probably don&#39;t realize that diabetes
actually causes one death every six
seconds so just to put that another way
that means about 14.5 percent of adult
deaths across the globe are caused by
diabetes so it&#39;s a big issue I mean when
you think about it people probably don&#39;t
realize they think about diabetes as
having a high blood blood glucose but
they don&#39;t realize why it would kill
people so when it&#39;s unregulated and not
controlled those elevated levels of
glucose can impact many of the different
tissues in the body so I&#39;ve put some of
them up here for you to see key tissues
and organ systems that are damaged
include the cardiovascular system so
blood vessel damage it can lead to
cardiovascular disease can lead to
stroke kidney disease it can also cause
terrible winds that are not don&#39;t heal
properly on the patients but can then
lead to them having to have an
amputation notice all of this as well as
having this impact in the patient is
it&#39;s a terrible burden to them but it
also it means that some of these
conditions as well as increasing their
disability they can also be
life-threatening
when we also think about the higher
levels of glucose on the flip side
another problem is that when there is
too little glucose getting into the body
tissues patients can actually lose
consciousness and you may have heard the
term diabetic coma
and that&#39;s another another problem
problem with that
but as well as thinking about these
impacts on the patient and their health
it&#39;s very very costly as well to society
so last year alone the NHS spent around
14 billion pounds treating diabetes now
that really makes us think we have to
come up with some new treatments for it
we have to think of new ways that we can
address these problems and I&#39;ve got up
here prevent it may be that if we try to
address some of the the lifestyle issues
of particularly for type 2 thinking
about cutting down what we eat and
having more exercise then that may have
an impact but it&#39;s only to a certain
extent because some patients even when
they do these things and they manage the
disease very well it&#39;s still it doesn&#39;t
have an impact for them and they still
can end up progressing to the stage
where they may also need insulin
injections and one of the reasons for
that is a lot of those awful
complications I told you about can
actually be present in the patient and
they don&#39;t know that they have diabetes
until one of those conditions develops
and it could be five or six years before
that&#39;s actually diagnosed and that so
that&#39;s why I&#39;ve got got prevent up there
what what I&#39;m thinking about more in
terms of prevention is that maybe we can
prevent the progression of those
complications so that we can then try to
stop patients from succumbing to these
life-threatening conditions but thinking
about the research community we have a
hope in the future that we might be able
to eventually at some point cure
diabetes we&#39;re not there yet it&#39;s down
the lane but one thing that we&#39;re
thinking of is using a special type of
sale to study the disease in more detail
that maybe in the future we can use and
that sales hype I want to talk to you
about now is there stem cells so many of
you have heard the term stem cells in
the media perhaps in a class these cells
are what we consider the master cells of
the body so they can go on and for more
specialized cells such as liver cells
blood cells
and the tape that I want to focus on are
a very special type of stem cell
they&#39;re called pluripotent stem cells
and pluripotent stem cells can form any
of the cells and tissues within our body
and the great thing about that is we can
use those to set up models of human
tissue that we could then use for
testing new drugs on for example the
type that my group and my research lab
work on are a type of pluripotent stem
cell that can actually made from any of
you sitting here they&#39;re what we call
patient derived cells and they&#39;ve been
induced to become stem cells so what we
do is we take a failed sample could be a
skin biopsy it could be a blood samples
I&#39;ve showed here and we take those blood
cells and we introduce into them some
key stem cell genes and what we do is we
take the blood cells and we cause them
to become stem cells we induce them to
become stem cells we call that process
of reprogramming and during the course
of about three weeks that the blood
cells slowly change and they lose their
blood cell their phenotype and they
start to become more primitive and more
unspecialized
to the pointman they then become stem
cells and we call those special stem
cells induced pluripotent stem cells or
iPS cells for short it&#39;s a lot easier is
the IPS phone and the great thing about
those is because they have that capacity
to form all the cells in the body we can
then in the lab work with those cells
and get them to become specific cell
types by controlling the growth
conditions so if we can take the cells
in addition we can add in specific
growth factors or chemical signals to
get them to drive them down specific
developmental pathways with the idea
being that we could use those sales for
example to address and restore the
insulin production by generating a new
source of the pancreatic beta cells what
we could also do to then address all of
those awful complications that
ultimately lead to patients deaths and I
he&#39;s is we could generate some of the
cell types that are involved that get
damaged in the disease such as kidney
cells or skin cells need to set up some
wound healing models and with the idea
that overall stem cells will act as a
bridge to developing new therapies and
to get us to stage one day where
diabetes is no longer a life-threatening
condition and will have a diabetes free
world thank you
