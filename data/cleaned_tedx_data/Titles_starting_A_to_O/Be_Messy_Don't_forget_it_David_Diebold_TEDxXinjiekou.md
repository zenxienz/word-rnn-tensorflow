are you always neat and tidy or can you
be a little bit messy well today I want
to talk about missing you know we are
all taught as children to behave be tidy
the order to be consistent and then when
we get a little bit over we&#39;re talking
well keep focused know where you&#39;re
going have a goal focus on it well I was
interested to read this very interesting
article by Tom Harper in the hand warden
newsletter a few weeks ago tom has
written a book about the importance of
being messy and his theory is you know
we live in a messy world now it&#39;s
getting Messier every day even we all
have a hundred million people now
posting on on social media and Facebook
and Twitter and all these things every
day we have all the news in the world
served up instantly and it gets a little
messy and so Tom&#39;s theory is that you
need to adjust to our world and you need
to think sometimes you need to be a
little messy and so what I thought this
is sort of interesting idea and I
thought maybe I would intestine
yeah I&#39;m the phone guy so I can look
back on a very interesting career all
over the world and maybe see if this
idea makes sense and it is my my
experience has been life is not the
grand equation where things follow in a
very straight methodical rational way
from the beginning to a conclusion you
just follow the pattern I don&#39;t think
that&#39;s the way life works I was reminded
of this recently
when Professor ishiguro from Osaka
University was in Beijing about a year
ago one of the world&#39;s great experts on
robotics with cotton boy his robot looks
pretty real and she really thought she
would go to her head smiled it looked
pretty real but the professor said she&#39;s
a robot
she&#39;s the machine she will never make a
mistake she&#39;ll do what I tell her to do
24 hours a day 7 days a week 30 days a
month and she&#39;ll never get tired and
she&#39;ll never get make a mistake humans
he said are very different you know we
get tired sometimes we even get mad we
get sick sometimes we can tell us some
other people and we have a hard time
working together but we humans have all
the creativity and the innovation and
the robots and the machines really have
none it&#39;s important to remember that now
this is an old old car that my family
had in the 1950s an old Chrysler
Imperial embassy that was a a great
machine and he must have weighed about
10 tons when I first came to China 34
years ago
the American government official I was
cutting around Beijing and one of these
things a red flag limousine made by the
FA W works in Changsha hit was very much
the same these were sort of like burrito
steel tanks dressed up for a party I
remember in the 1960s but my older
brothers got their drivers license and
we found this old Christ were in fifth a
garage and we thought we&#39;d better take
it out and see how fast it go and my
brother driving you know just about
eighteen and nineteen and he got it
going a hundred a hundred and ten miles
an hour in 1960 it was just incredible
and when I remember about that and what
I remember thinking about that red flag
limousine I first encountered it vision
was that it was great going in a
straight line but I remember what my
brother expected turned him a little bit
it would start to shiver and shake and
you had the sense that if you turned it
too far it would just roll over it was a
machine designed to go in a straight
line it was not a machine designed to
turn corners and go sideways now to
amuse one of my heroes one of my Chinese
heroes the first Chinese to win the
Nobel Prize for medicine really heroic
push to achieve what she achieved and
she is not a doctor she didn&#39;t have a
doctorate and she wasn&#39;t even a
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences well
that&#39;s a little bit of an interesting
path and I would improved by some
research that was done a few years ago
about the Nobel Prize winners in science
the ones who win the prizes for physics
and math and chemistry and medicine and
the research revealed that they were two
and a half times more likely to play a
musical instrument than the average
person
now that led the researchers to conclude
that actually there was a link between
music and the creativity and innovation
that led to the Nobel Prize and I see
this around this is this is Bob being a
student in Beijing there he is doing a
solo violin in front of a full symphony
orchestra heading off to Duke at the
pool this is Damon Jenny also from
Beijing a great guitarist he actually
built himself his first bass guitarist
and then founded about four or five
bands in Beijing I was in high school
and now he&#39;s just finished his first
year at the University of Virginia well
their lives weren&#39;t so conventional
their parents didn&#39;t say to them look
it&#39;s Saturday Mac you can&#39;t fill out
can&#39;t fill the page
you can&#39;t go out with your friends and
you really stay home and study study
study we all hear that I&#39;m a parent I&#39;m
sure I said it many times myself but I&#39;m
not sure that was the right thing
because these are the students that are
getting accepted in all the great
schools the students who were a little
bit broader and their interests and
activities and therefore a little bit
more creative and the universities
looked for this now the story of
bearings Bank I worked for about 20
years in London and when I was there one
of the great old British merchant bank
the oldest block bearings bank went bust
his 1995 a great Bank for the 250 year
old tradition the Queen was a customer
of bearings Bank and how did bearings
Bank lose their way the full of bearings
is a collapse that made nothing
improbable it was all due to a 28 year
old investor trader
based in Singapore and he went well
beyond his legal limit for training and
he decided he was smart enough nick
leeson to really double the fortunes of
the bank so he bet big about a billion
dollars on the stock market allergist
and
you know going up he&#39;s studied it very
carefully it was a very experienced and
successful trader and all of a sudden
the averages started to rise but what
happened they had an earthquake in Tokyo
and it was a disaster it destroyed a lot
of the infrastructure the roads some
buildings but not too many main
infrastructure and what happened the
stock market went dropped and that was
the end of bearings been in doubt and it
was a sad story honestly I don&#39;t
remember the family Peter baring was a
lovely man and they even had to sell the
old family jewels there&#39;s one of the
famous ones and there&#39;s an auction
record at Christie&#39;s got about a million
and a half dollars for it and that was
just one of the things the family had to
give up in addition to the bank well my
point is only algorithms and trading
patterns in the world are great but you
just need to miss one thing like the
earthquake the possibility of an
earthquake and you got no avail we lose
everything so it&#39;s another reason to
think a little bit the messy
think sideways think what can happen but
I haven&#39;t thought about another
interesting thought came to mind which
is all the inventions that have been
invented by mistake
we all know the story of plastics it was
just a pile of chemicals
overnight laughs by the state and what
they came into morning there was plastic
I think what that means that meant to
our world you all know what this is
microwave oven but you might not know
how the microwave oven was discovered
there was that there was a researcher in
one of the old technology companies in
the u.s. dealing with old-fashioned -
this was before the period of
transistors before the invention of
transistors and one day he was playing
around in the tubes the old tubes and he
realized he looked down and a chocolate
bar that he had in his pocket
and melted because it was a little bit
too close to the tomb and he was fine
enough that to realize well if that
could happen
I can cook with it in a microwave oven
another one in my own old town this is
dr. Nelson great back and he discovered
that the pacemaker the heart pacemaker
the healer you get routinely insert in
somebody&#39;s chest and it helps with
movement of the heart and he&#39;s tried and
tried and tried to get it right and one
day he was in the lab and he reached
into the bag of transistors and by
mistake he pulled out a bigger
transmission transistor that he thought
and he put it in the pacemaker and put
it in a patient and he noticed all of a
sudden it started to vibrate he&#39;d never
had that happen before and that&#39;s what
he was after
probably ten million the lives of 10
million people have been saved because
he grabbed the wrong transistor out of
the box of transistor I lectured a lot
on critical thinking let&#39;s draw a little
bit from that you&#39;ve got to use all your
senses give life and you&#39;ve got to use
them all the time
gotta use them looking and listening
sideway seeing listening touch taste and
smell you never know where the clue is
going to come from laughs a lot
appreciate the whimsical the incongruous
and the unexpected and a little bit like
the story on the earthquake always think
about the unexpected don&#39;t get o2
overwhelmed by what&#39;s predictable and
what&#39;s normal and what&#39;s neat and over
don&#39;t hesitate to laugh at yourself a
last drink how to get a child yeah sure
I assume some of you managed to get a
job
I remember one job I got I got because I
went to a bunch and I sat next to a
stranger and we started talking and we
developed a nice friendship I was at the
American Embassy in London at the time
he said the Regal David this is really
good fun to talk and we&#39;ll hear finished
from the embassy you know I hope to
continue our conversation and that
resulted in an absolute wonderful job
all over the world for ten years with
one of the international law firms now
how do you predict the lunches you are
going to go to in five years or ten
years how you didn&#39;t predict the person
you sit next to well of course you can
and the story is how much of life
actually happens that you cannot predict
in advance so the thing that&#39;s important
is not predicting it but keeping your
eyes open so when it comes along you&#39;re
recognizable and and talk to the person
next to you and follow-up and there you
go that&#39;s a secret
in closing I just pick up this wonderful
quote by John Lennon you may remember
one of the Beatles you probably send a
lot of the songs at the KTV the life is
what happens while you are busy making
other plans be missing
