thank you thanks very much good evening
um my name is Bob I when they first
asked me ash and all the people here to
give a talk about lessons learned I I
took a full inventory of my very
favorite horrifying screw-ups of the
course of my life and I&#39;m happy to tell
you that I&#39;ve lived long enough that I
have a nice list to choose from my
favorite little tidbit is that I have
lost on Jeopardy more often than anyone
alive that is actually true you can
google that I I&#39;ve been on the show for
fourteen times including some
Invitational tournaments and yeah well
someone has to lose to Ken and I have so
far not won a total of four point 1
million dollars thank you I&#39;m not bitter
at all so but I did win some money I did
pretty well in the show and that changed
my situation financially which was neat
and I&#39;ve had a lot of other really good
fortune I got to be a luxury travel
writer even though my clothes don&#39;t fit
and I I really I&#39;ve had a really lucky
life plus let&#39;s face it all the
privilege all of the privilege is right
here and so at some point in your life
you want to just you know do something
charitable do something good with your
life and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in that
I&#39;m sure every single person in here in
the same set of situation you know we
would do the same thing is there anybody
in here doesn&#39;t want to make the world a
better place just show your hand we&#39;re
at a TED event you&#39;re in the wrong room
entirely basically so I and you know it
I didn&#39;t want to just give money or
something like that I wanted to get my
hands dirty jump in do some you know big
big project and not just out of like a
charitable impulse out of generosity I
mean I have some alone that but there
was also some real selfishness involved
to be honest I I wanted to do something
good there was that and there&#39;s also you
know you hear like people&#39;s lives being
changed and transformed by their charity
work by their volunteer work you hear
the stories of people&#39;s lives gaining
meaning and purpose and you know oh give
me some of that that sounds fun
I want that so I decided I&#39;d find
something and you have you ever really
been at a party and there&#39;ll be somebody
who&#39;s so like
world with their volunteer work that
they they they they wind up saying
things they don&#39;t even make sense at
first out of context like I just got
back from Haiti and it was awesome and
my first thought if you&#39;re like me is
like really I doesn&#39;t look awesome maybe
volunteering is that great okay
so I&#39;ll try it and I&#39;m a writer so I I
decided to do a book project which Chris
briefly mentioned I took my nest egg and
I invested it in small businesses around
the world there&#39;s people who live on
three or four dollars a day shopkeepers
and grocers farmers craftspeople and so
on of if you&#39;re a fisherman with a
rowboat and explains a leak you can&#39;t go
to Citibank for a bridge loan you need
small capital you need people like you
and me to invest and help out and so
there&#39;s this thing called micro lending
and a charity platform called kiva.org
that makes it possible for anyone to put
a little bit of money in and help people
build their businesses all over the
world so I thought okay let&#39;s find out
whether this works I&#39;ll take my nest egg
and I put I made thousands of loans
through Kiva out to their field partners
and then in 80 some odd countries around
the world and for my book project I
followed the money I went to Kiva and
then I went to field partners on five
continents and then I found the the loan
officers and ultimately found clients
themselves who had previously only seen
in my laptop as you know click send
money good yay and I got to show up on
their doorstep and actually say hi my
name&#39;s Bob I&#39;m from Los Angeles and I&#39;ve
come to Daraa Salaam Tanzania to ask you
how your woodworking business is going
hi
I did that on five continents for years
and generally speaking and by the way I
never told them I was a lender because
that would be really gross you know
they&#39;d create this nasty indebtedness
Tony Soprano vibe but I&#39;d want to you
know I hope you like the cow he helped
you by I didn&#39;t want to do that so I
would just show up with a translator and
generally speaking whether it was Peru
or Kenya they would look at me and
they&#39;d kind of turned their head a
little and then they&#39;d look at the
translator like it&#39;s key for real and
the translator would be like that and
that&#39;s a universal body language by the
way and but in ten minutes I would be
meeting them and getting to know them
even in places that I was a little
afraid of I was welcomed like an old
friend everywhere I went and my god it
was it was awesome I got to meet the
here&#39;s the truth I&#39;ve been to 81
countries so far and whether you&#39;re
Hindu Buddhist Christian Muslim whatever
the one universal truth I&#39;ve seen every
single place I&#39;ve been is that everybody
just wants a better life for their kids
we have a bazillion disagreements about
how obviously but that is a true thing
that is a human dream and if you connect
on that level with people magic happens
magic people start opening up to you and
I saw in places where people make three
bucks a day creativity and hope because
they love their children in a work ethic
and resilience people who&#39;ve been
through Wars
I saw welcomes everywhere and it didn&#39;t
matter where I was even in places I was
honestly a little afraid to go and so I
learned that microfinance actually does
work pretty well when it&#39;s properly
administered like any human construction
I learned that people are freaking
awesome and I have a sense of connection
that I never dreamed of and my own life
it got awesome usually only usually and
this is the part that&#39;s the catch the
thing is in and this needs to be talked
about in if you do volunteer work or
whatever what I did is for my book I
wanted to see microfinance in its most
challenging environments so I went to
Beirut and I showed up hi how&#39;s it going
how&#39;s it going in Beirut and I heard
their stories and they&#39;ve been through
some stuff I went to Rwanda and I sat
with people who&#39;d survived the genocide
and I heard their stories with empathy
and I heard the
I could go on and on a Cambodia I went
to pen on pen and seam reap and I I
heard stories of people who survived the
the Khmer Rouge of Sarajevo people who&#39;d
survived the siege and so on and so I
was hearing these stories with empathy
and eager to write them because I want
everyone to feel what I got to feel um
and holding these stories for years as I
was working on the book I didn&#39;t realize
that I was actually giving myself an
atrocity world tour as I was getting to
see all of this so I came home with
mission I had purpose I&#39;m gonna write
this book and it&#39;s gonna help these
people and I wrote and I wrote and I
mean I actually I&#39;m really proud of the
book that I wrote and I banged that
thing out and I was expecting to feel
super proud and I hit that and I hit
Send on that thing and I sent it off to
the publisher and an interesting thing
happened I was proud for about six hours
and all of the stories that I&#39;ve been
holding here finally I didn&#39;t need to
think about them anymore they all came
here and about six hours later I was
running errands through Los Angeles just
driving and all of a sudden I started
weeping my whole body just shaking I
couldn&#39;t stop it I didn&#39;t know what&#39;s
going on I figured you know okay it&#39;s
postpartum every big project there&#39;s a
period of grief that you&#39;re done that&#39;s
true maybe I&#39;m just tired I worked
really hard I&#39;ll get some rest and the
next day and then the next we&#39;re hard
and I didn&#39;t know what was happening to
me and I was thinking well I&#39;ll get
through it I&#39;ll just power through it
I&#39;m strong I&#39;ll just power through it&#39;ll
be fine and it didn&#39;t get better I
started having nightmares I missed sleep
I started seeing stories that I&#39;d heard
things that weren&#39;t even in the book
that I can&#39;t watch Game of Thrones let&#39;s
say that that&#39;s really true I can&#39;t
watch Game of Thrones because stuff like
that happens and I&#39;d met people who had
family and I was really starting to and
I was wondering God what&#39;s wrong with me
because these people had all survived
these things and they&#39;re okay and I just
heard the stories and I&#39;m falling apart
what am i weak what&#39;s happening and and
while this is going on I started
drinking a doctor put me on anti-anxiety
medications which I do not recommend and
then the book comes out and I&#39;ve got to
do TV and radio so I&#39;m going out what
you know and I enjoyed those things
because I got to tell the true story of
the brilliant creative people that I met
in what seemed to me previously unlikely
places so that was fun and I had hope
and then I still go
back to the hotel and I would drink or I
would cry and I did not know what was
happening to me until and this is part
of what I came here to tell you a
counselor told me about a thing called
secondary PTSD now it should make total
sense what that is at this point and
human beings are silly putty of course
that exists of course it&#39;s a thing if
you&#39;re an empathetic if I put a big
picture of a cute kitty up on the screen
300 people go it&#39;s just it&#39;s how we are
right or if I showed you romance with
the heart and people holding their hands
you have your romantic memories and if I
showed you something horrible from a war
zone you&#39;d all feel horror of course you
would so naturally if you spend a lot of
time working with people who are under
stress or suffered trauma you may start
absorbing some of it and if you haven&#39;t
had training and I&#39;ll and people don&#39;t
talk about this I&#39;ve almost never met
anybody who even knows what this is then
it can hit you and you don&#39;t know what
it is so one of the reasons I wanted to
come here was to talk about this not
just for you guys but also to put it up
on the internet because there are people
out there suffering right now if you are
a military spouse if you are a first
responder an EMT who sees this every day
even if you&#39;re someone from a community
that suffered from an active shooter or
a hurricane or any kind of disaster or
even if you&#39;re a professional counselor
who works with victims of trauma and
abuse and you haven&#39;t set your life up
perfectly you may be hurting now in a
way that you weren&#39;t expecting to hurt
and there&#39;s nothing wrong with you you
just took on a really hard job
there&#39;s counseling to be done you can
it&#39;s fine just go get help you&#39;ll be
okay so that needs to be said now for
everybody else in here you might be
thinking to yourself well thanks for
sharing Bob now I never want to do
anything nice for anyone
as long as I live that sounds like hell
no that&#39;s exactly the wrong message
actually you should come out walk out of
here feeling incredibly empowered you
should feel bold and eager to go change
the world I asked you earlier hey
anybody here not want to change the
world and of course everybody does well
what&#39;s stopping you fear you can sense
we Intuit that anytime we connect to
another human being we may be changed in
the transaction and if you&#39;re working
with somebody you&#39;re trying to help
something or do something that&#39;s scary
it gets you out of your comfort zone and
you may feel some of it we Intuit this
it&#39;s part of why we don&#39;t do it and what
I&#39;m trying to give you is what it looks
like in your worst case scenario some
untrained lunatic alone it goes and sits
under a tree in Rwanda and hears stories
and then goes to the next town in the
next village in the next country and
does this for years and I came home and
I had a couple of crappy months so what
that&#39;s fine and by the way I wouldn&#39;t
trade one second of any of it good and
bad because in addition to every single
memory that I struggle with periodically
I also have a thousand others that give
me hope in a way that I wish I had ours
to share with you I have a faith in
humanity now that I would never have had
otherwise so when there&#39;s something that
you want to do in the world and there
will be something whatever it is you&#39;re
probably not going to Rwanda I don&#39;t
know what it is that you are passionate
about but I know if you&#39;re doing meals
on wheels you can do meals on wheels go
it&#39;s not gonna be that bad when you feel
that fear of this is gonna be different
this is gonna be changed it&#39;s gonna be
challenging that fear is a gateway to
the world you want to make to the change
in other people to help you want to give
and I&#39;ve gone through that and if I have
anything I can John you from an
unexpected set of experiences that be
bold in your generosity be brave
love people you don&#39;t even know because
you know what happens it&#39;s awesome
and usually and when it&#39;s not that&#39;s
okay too
Thanks
[Applause]
