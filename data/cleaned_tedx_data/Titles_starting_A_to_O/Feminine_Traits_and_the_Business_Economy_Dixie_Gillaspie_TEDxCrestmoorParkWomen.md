so yeah this is me
kind of looking deceptively 2br yeah I
just felt that necessarily early this is
also me um and somebody told me I
couldn&#39;t reach the cherries you know on
his tell me I can&#39;t these company it&#39;s
the best way to get me to do it so of
course I was going after the cherries
and this was a few years later not so
little math so kids still just as
determined you wouldn&#39;t know from
looking at those pictures but I was
raised in what we call the man box can
anybody relate yeah we know dream boxes
right so um I think my dad might have
been hoping for a son that wasn&#39;t what
he got it didn&#39;t make any difference I
was still raised in the mailbox but you
know I&#39;ve got a lot of women out there
we&#39;re raised by the same rules or you
found your way into that box at some
point especially if you went into a
career in business right what&#39;s the man
box if any of you don&#39;t know what the
man box is it&#39;s this place where if
you&#39;re sick you&#39;re tired you&#39;re injured
well you just man up and do it anyway
all right if you&#39;re scared you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s chin up grow up here whatever um
and you know if you&#39;re sad you&#39;re
depressed well you just remember big
boys don&#39;t cry and that goes for girls
too
so that&#39;s Kamiya box it&#39;s not a fun
place to get stuck no matter your gender
but um if those lessons did come to
serve me very well my father passed away
over 30 years ago when I was in my early
20s and those man box lessons stuck in
my head and they come in handy sometimes
they came in really handy I left college
actually to take care of my father in
the last stages of bone cancer and so
right after that you know it&#39;s kind of
loose ends do I go out to college what
am I getting - I went and sold cars now
this was small town southeast Kansas so
it wasn&#39;t really cars who was poor
trucks but whatever those man box girls
came in really handy they&#39;ve served me
what very well in business um you know
in getting into management have
leadership becoming a consultant
becoming coach business and what&#39;s all
that stuff there&#39;s me unbox rules have
served me very well but certainly they
can be very confining right because when
I straight it out to be
in business male or female you had to be
tough you had to stand your ground
you had to outs shall outsmart up
perform pretty much everybody in order
just to be heard and that kind of sounds
like business as usual doesn&#39;t it yeah
it is it is business as usual because
for many many years decades have not
finished crappy business especially has
been a masculine centric power structure
did you agree very much stuff right so
right or wrong that&#39;s the way that it&#39;s
been women have certainly found some
places at the table but even when they
did generally the standards by which
business got gone we&#39;re defined by her
people that had had those seats before
and that was largely men now there have
been some exceptions this one in
particular I&#39;m very fond of Colleen
Barrett definitely breaks that mold her
mantra lead with love has been very
successful I had the opportunity to
share an event with Colleen several
years ago and if you ever met this woman
or listened to her speak you know that
she embodies that lingerie league with
love both the leadership and the love
completely just a a walking testimonial
to what that does in business but I
don&#39;t think anybody could argue with her
success or with the legacy that she&#39;s
left at Southwest for the most part
however women are still conforming to
the man box if they want to have top
leadership roles in business so what you
know how do we change that well people
have started trying to change that by
doing studies right that&#39;s what we
always do we want to change something we
need to find the problem let&#39;s do a
bunch of studies so there have been so
many studies done on the effectiveness
of women in leadership roles go google
it well I mean not right now because I
am limited about of time so don&#39;t do it
right this minute because I was only
you&#39;ll get page after page after page of
all these articles and white papers and
infographics and some of them are funny
and some of them not so much and page
after page I have one article it said
there were hundreds of these studies on
the effectiveness of women in business
leadership roles and I thought I&#39;m not
gonna read all of them
but let me give you soon as
in pools of once that I read okay here&#39;s
here&#39;s just a few
there was this one and we had this one
and we had this one okay those kinda
start looking compelling right if you
just look at the findings of these
studies on whether or not women can be
effective in business leadership roles
you start thinking well this kind of
fuels that idea that women and
leadership roles actually one of the
keys to business growth because they
come up at the end these days and many
many others come to the same basic
conclusion that this says with a high
number of women in leadership roles see
greater financial success so why then do
we still see the lack of diversity in
gender roles at the top why do we still
have a disparity if it&#39;s that obvious I
bet you guys have some theories right
like you got a theory got a theory I&#39;d
love to hear your theories but but
really when you look at it this way
here&#39;s here&#39;s what I know I&#39;ve spent
most of my life somewhere in the
trenches of this this gender war I
actually started my consulting career in
medical management at a time when pretty
much healthy other medical management
consultants were male and they had dr
infinite i was another one so i didn&#39;t
really have a lot going for me it&#39;s a i
was extremely effective so i became
somewhat of an exception right i went
through many years of competing in that
world&#39;s competing in the strategic
analysis business analysis world man
that most of my peers were men and so
there&#39;s a lot of testing that goes on i
think they did their own studies on the
effectiveness of women in business
leadership roles and most recently i
served on the executive business team of
an online magazine that&#39;s devoted to the
issues of masculinity in our modern
world in this century
and i saw it from the other side from
men saying hey wait a minute we&#39;re very
confused about what&#39;s expected of us
these days the gender roles are shifting
now what are we supposed to do and hey
we haven&#39;t had it all so easy all this
time i mean you try taking off for
childcare when you&#39;re male right valid
point
so I&#39;ve spent a lot of years in in that
kind of in the trenches so to speak and
I can tell you this if we try to
understand this disparity through the
lens of gender alone we are setting the
business world on a sure path to failure
and why do I say that because what we&#39;re
doing is we&#39;re examining who&#39;s better
not what it takes to be successful but
what gender it takes to be successful
we&#39;re looking for who&#39;s superior and a
gender war is always always a zero-sum
game so what do all those studies miss
out on they&#39;re all missing out on one
factor that has never really as nearly
as I know been examine masculine energy
is not exclusive to men any more than
feminine energy is exclusive to women so
they keep looking at the genders
specific as you represent as female
we&#39;re going to study you as a woman you
person as male were in a study was a
male you haven&#39;t really done that said
what are the characteristics of
masculine and feminine energy and how do
those contribute to business success so
what do I mean by masculine and feminine
energy these are some traits that we
usually think of as masks on them by the
way this isn&#39;t something that I just
created I didn&#39;t just randomly say well
when I observed men they look a lot like
this so I&#39;m gonna say that&#39;s masculine
energy when I observe women they look
like this we&#39;ve understood these
energies as masculine and feminine since
the beginning of recorded history if not
since the beginning of time so it isn&#39;t
about gender it&#39;s about what we think of
a masculine energy sometimes it&#39;s
referred to as the divine masculine
divine feminine and young whatever but
these are just traits or characteristics
I sometimes call them superpowers hey
just look at these the superpowers that
anybody can embody and these are the
ones that we normally think of as
masculine all right so if you look at
those you know those are those are very
important and I would say essential to
business success
these are superpowers in
so nobody is suggesting that we need to
structure a business without them but
what about the feminine superpowers how
did those show how do we understand the
importance of these traits and
characteristics and energies and
business success well some of them are
maybe a little more obvious than others
so if you think about creativity
collaboration even intuition those are
words that you will find in a lot of
value mission vision state that&#39;s right
companies understand the importance of
those traits they may not understand
that they&#39;re coming in in nature that
they understand the value of those
traits what about something like
compassion so if you think about it
compassion is the cuter part if you will
it&#39;s a competition and we know of that
business leaders have to be comfortable
at competition but where does compassion
connect so you&#39;re probably thinking well
compassion might come in in terms of
customer service compassion might come
in in terms of employee loyalty
compassion might come in in terms of
branding messaging understanding what
the buyer wants right but would it
surprise you to know that compassion can
actually create changes in the brain
yeah in 2004 there was a group of
neuroscientists one philosopher that
always breaks up the flow a little bit
right yeah one philosopher the Dalai
Lama and some other months that not to
discuss whether or not mental training
could create clinical changes in the
brain the interesting study one at one
of the stays that was reported in this
book train your mind change your brain
was a study that they did on months who
had logged thousands of hours in
meditation or what we would certainly
consider mental training and what they
found is they use the functional MRI so
basically a brain scan if you will and
they would ask a monk to put themselves
in a certain state
you know state of mind your meditation
and what they found is when the locks
put themselves in a state of compassion
again the frequency in the brain went up
dramatically now gamma frequency is the
highest frequency we&#39;ve measured in the
human brain it&#39;s associated with peak
performance is associated with improved
memory and recall and improved physical
performance it&#39;s associated with being
able to process information more quickly
and more accurately if you&#39;ve ever had
that yes I can do anything kind of
feeling there&#39;s a slide of somebody
doing that better than I can
I bet all of you can do it right I ever
had that yes yes I think some of you
doing it that I can do anything kind of
feeling it probably means that you were
experiencing a lot of gamma frequency
activity in your brain and ironically
being in the state of compassion creates
that state being in a state of
compassion
even though compassion is the
counterpart of competition it can make
you better at competition isn&#39;t that
cool that a feminine characteristic
augment a masculine characteristic this
doesn&#39;t really seem accidental mate
right so when you think about then the
masculine and the feminine and you think
about those studies my challenge to to
all of you is to look at it this way
what if all of those studies were maybe
not meaningless but misleading I mean
when was the last time you saw a study
on whether or not men or effective
business leaders could somebody point me
in the direction of that study I haven&#39;t
seen it yet right we assume men are
effective business leaders and then you
see the studies that say okay let&#39;s talk
about men who are effective business
leaders and let&#39;s look at what those men
do that make them so special and you
know a lot of times you will find that
the characteristics that they cite in
those business leaders who have taken
companies from crash
two on fire can&#39;t be stopped our
feminine characteristics yeah
[Applause]
so what would happen instead of studying
the genders in business leadership if we
studied the characteristics what do you
think would happen if we said how does
this characteristic impact business
leadership not whether or not it&#39;s
masculine or feminine because they
aren&#39;t exclusive I have embodied and
I&#39;ve reached a ton of masculine energy
to get where I am and I would vet every
successful woman out there has done the
same because they&#39;re important in
business and most of the men that you
study who are effective business leaders
not just managers not just you know
strategy but leaders have embodied and
leveraged a lot of feminine energy as
well so if we really want to see more
opportunities for women in top business
roles what I believe has to happen is if
we we have to stop this battle of the
sexes we have to stop thinking our women
good at business leadership duh we have
to start thinking what characteristics
are important in our culture what
characteristics are important to our
people what characteristics are
important to our success as a company
and we start looking for people
regardless of gender to have those
characteristics we start rewarding
people regardless of gender who have
those characteristics and what will
happen is that more women will
organically find their place in top
levels of business leadership because we
have what it takes
they don&#39;t need studies to tell us
flavor challenge for all of you I would
like for you to choose one of these
feminine characteristics and I want you
to own it I want you to own it I want
you to think about who the world models
that for you in a way that you&#39;d like to
emulate I&#39;d like you to think about how
would embodying that characteristic
change you and the world for the better
and I&#39;d like you to think about how you
can use that how you can put that to use
in your thoughts and your feelings and
your actions every day because when we
do that not only do we have businesses
in a world that&#39;s less stressed more
creative and more productive we also
create businesses that are more
financially stable in an uncertain
economic environment and that
