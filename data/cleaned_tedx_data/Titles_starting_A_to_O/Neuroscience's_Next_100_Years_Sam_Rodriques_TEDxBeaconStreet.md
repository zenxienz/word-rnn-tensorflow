I want to tell you guys something about
neuroscience I&#39;m a physicist by training
about three years ago I left physics to
come and try to understand how the brain
works and this is what I found lots of
people are working on depression and
that&#39;s really good I mean depression is
something that we really want to
understand okay but here&#39;s how you do it
you take a jar and you fill it up about
halfway with one and then you take a
maps and you put the mouse in the jar
okay
and the mouse swims around for a little
while and then at some point the mouse
gets tired and decides to stop swimming
and when stops swimming that&#39;s the
pressure okay and I&#39;m from theoretical
physics so I&#39;m used to people making
very sophisticated mathematical models
to precisely describe physical phenomena
so when I saw that this is the model for
depression I thought to myself oh my god
we have a lot of work to do but this is
a kind of general problem in
neuroscience so for example take emotion
lots of people want to understand
emotion but you can&#39;t study emotion in
mice or monkeys because you can&#39;t ask
them how they&#39;re feeling or what they&#39;re
experiencing so instead people who want
to understand emotion typically end up
studying what&#39;s called motivated
behavior which is code for what the
mouse does when it really really wants
cheese okay I could go on and on I mean
the point is the NIH spends about five
and a half billion dollars a year on
neuroscience research and yet there have
been almost no significant improvements
in outcomes for patients with brain
diseases in the past 40 years and I
think a lot of that is basically due to
the fact that mice might be okay as a
model for cancer or diabetes but the
mouse brain is just not sophisticated
enough to reproduce human psychology or
human brain disease okay so if the mouse
models are so bad why are we still using
them well it basically boils down to
this the brain is made up of neurons
which are these little cells that send
electrical signals to each other
if you want to understand how the brain
works you have to be able to measure the
electrical activity of these neurons but
to do that you have to get really close
to the neurons with some kind of
electrical recording device or a
microscope and so you can do that in
mice and you can do it in monkeys
because you can physically put things
into their brain but for some reason we
still can&#39;t do that in humans ok so
instead we&#39;ve invented all these proxies
so the most popular one is probably this
functional MRI fMRI which allows you to
make these pretty pictures like this
that show which parts of your brain
light up when you&#39;re engaged in
different activities but this is a proxy
it&#39;s not you&#39;re not actually measuring
neural activity here what you&#39;re doing
is you&#39;re measuring essentially like
blood flow in the brain like where
there&#39;s more blood it&#39;s actually where
there&#39;s more oxygen but you get the idea
ok the other thing that you can do is
you can do this electroencephalography
you can put these electrodes on your
head ok and then you can measure your
brain waves um and here you&#39;re actually
measuring electrical activity but you&#39;re
not measuring the activity of neurons
you&#39;re measuring these currents these
electrical currents sloshing back and
forth in your bread so the point is just
that these technologies that we have are
really measuring the wrong thing because
for most of the diseases that we want to
understand like Parkinson&#39;s is the
classic example in Perkins&#39;s there&#39;s one
particular kind of neuron deep in your
brain that is responsible for the
disease and these technologies just
don&#39;t have the resolution that you need
to get at that and so that&#39;s why we&#39;re
still stuck with the animals
now that anyone wants to be studying
depression by putting mice into jars
right it&#39;s just that there&#39;s this
pervasive sense that it&#39;s not possible
to look at the activity of neurons in
healthy humans so here&#39;s what I want to
do I want to take you into the future to
have a look at one way in which I think
it could potentially be possible and I
want to preface this by saying I don&#39;t
have all the details so I&#39;m just gonna
provide you with a kind of outline but
we&#39;re gonna go to the year 2100 now what
is the year 2100 look like well to start
with but
it is a bit warmer than what you&#39;re used
to and that vacuum cleaner that robotic
vacuum cleaner that you know and love
went through a few generations and the
improvements were not always so good
there was not always for the better okay
but actually in the year 2100 most
things are surprisingly recognizable
it&#39;s just the brain is totally different
for example in the year 2100 we
understand the root causes of
Alzheimer&#39;s so we can deliver targeted
genetic therapies or drugs to stop the
degenerative process before it begins so
how did we do it well there were
essentially three steps the first step
was that we had to figure out some way
to get electrical connections through
the skull so we could measure the
electrical activity of neurons and not
only that it had to be easy and
risk-free something that basically
anyone would be okay with like getting a
piercing because back in 2017 the only
way that we knew of to get through the
skull was to drill these holes the size
of quarters you would never let someone
do that to you
so in the 2020s people began to
experiment rather than throwing these
gigantic holes throwing microscopic
holes no thicker than a piece of hair
and the idea here was really for
diagnosis there are lots of times in the
diagnosis of brain disorders when you
would like to have to be able to look at
the neural activity beneath the skull
and being able to draw these microscopic
holes would make that much easier for
the patient in the end it would be like
getting a shot you just go in and you
sit down and there&#39;s a thing that comes
out in your head and the momentary sting
and then it&#39;s done and you can go back
about your day
so we have were eventually able to do it
using lasers to drill the holes and with
the lasers it was fast and extremely
reliable you couldn&#39;t even tell the
holes were there any more than you could
tell that one of your hairs was missing
and I know it might sound crazy using
lasers to draw holes in your skull
but back in 2017 people were okay with
surgeons shooting lasers into their eyes
for corrective surgeries so when you&#39;re
already here it&#39;s not that big of a step
okay so the next step that happened in
the 2030s with that it&#39;s not just about
getting through the skull to measure the
activity of neurons you have to actually
make it into the brain tissue itself and
the risk whenever you put something into
the brain tissue is essentially that of
stroke that you would hit a blood vessel
and burst it and that causes a stroke so
by the mid 2030s we had invented these
flexible probes that were capable of
going around blood vessels rather than
through them and thus we could put huge
batteries of these probes into the
brains of patients and record from
thousands of their neurons without any
risk to them and what we discovered sort
of to our surprise is that the neurons
that we could identify were not
responding to things like ideas or
emotion which was what we had expected
they were mostly responding to things
like Jennifer Aniston or Halle Berry or
Justin Trudeau I mean
in hindsight we shouldn&#39;t have been that
surprised I mean what are your neurons
spend most of their time thinking about
but but really I mean the point is that
this this technology enabled us to begin
studying neuroscience in individuals so
much like the transition to genetics at
the single cell level we started to
study neuroscience at the single human
level but we weren&#39;t quite there yet
because these technologies were still
restricted to medical applications which
meant that we were studying sick brains
not healthy brains because no matter how
safe your technology is you can&#39;t stick
something into someone&#39;s brain for
research purposes they have to want it
and why would they want it because as
soon as you have an electrical
connection to the brain you can use it
to hook the brain up to a computer oh
wow you know the general public was very
skeptical at first I mean who wants to
hook their brain up to their computers
well just imagine being able to send an
email with a thought imagine being able
to take imagine being able to take a
picture with your eyes okay imagine
never forgetting anything anymore
because anything that you choose to
remember will be stored permanently on a
hard drive somewhere able to be recalled
at will
the line here between crazy and
visionary was never quite clear but the
systems were safe so when the FDA
decided to deregulate these laser
throwing systems in 2043 commercial
demand just exploded people started
signing their emails please excuse any
typos sent from my brain commercial
systems popped up left and right
offering the latest and greatest in
neural interfacing technology there were
a hundred electrodes a thousand
electrodes high bandwidth for only
$99.99 a month soon everyone had them
and that was the key because in the
2050s if you were neuroscientists you
could have someone come into your lab a
century from off the street and you
could have engaged some emotional task
or social behavior or abstract reasoning
things you could never study in mites
and you could record their admin
activity of their neurons using the
interfaces that they already had and
then you could also ask them about when
they were experiencing so this link
between psychology and neuroscience that
you could never make in the animals was
suddenly better so perhaps the classic
example of this with the discovery of
the neural basis for insight that aha
moment the moment when it all comes
together it clicks and this was
discovered by two scientists in 2055
berry and late who observed in the
dorsal prefrontal cortex here how in the
in the brain of someone trying to
understand an idea how different
populations of neurons would reorganize
themselves you&#39;re looking at neural
activity here in orange until finally
there are two tia lines it leads to
positive feedback right there
that is understanding so finally we were
able to get at the things that make us
human and that&#39;s what really opened the
way to major insights from medicine
because starting in the 26 seats with
the ability to record the neural
activity
the brains of patients with these
different mental diseases rather than
defining the diseases on the basis of
their symptoms as we had at the
beginning of the century we started to
define them on the basis of the actual
pathology that we observed at the neural
level so for example we discovered in
the case of ADHD we discovered that
there are dozens of different diseases
all of which had been called ADHD at the
start of the century that actually had
nothing to do with each other except
that they had similar symptoms and they
need to be treated in different ways so
it was kind of incredible in retrospect
that at the beginning of the century
we&#39;ve been treating all of these
different diseases with the same drug
just by giving people I&#39;m fine I mean
basically it&#39;s what we were doing at
schizophrenia and depression are the
same way so rather than prescribing
drugs to people essentially at random as
we had we learned how to predict which
drugs would be most effective in which
patients and that just led to this huge
improvement in outcomes okay I want to
bring you back now to the year 2017 some
of this may sound satirical or even
far-fetched and some of it is I mean I
can&#39;t actually see into the future I
don&#39;t actually know if we&#39;re gonna be
drawing hundreds or thousands of
microscopic holes in our heads in 30
years but what I can tell you is that
we&#39;re not gonna make any progress
towards understanding the human brain or
human diseases until we figure out how
to get at the electrical activity of
neurons in that in healthy humans and
almost no one is working on figuring out
how to do that today that is the future
of neuroscience and I think it&#39;s time
for neuroscientists to put down the
mouse brain and to dedicate the thought
and investment necessary to understand
the human brain and human disease thank
