good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
oh hey really happy to hear you guys are
here some of you awake so finding your
true not you know it sounds heavy you
know all of us have dreams aspirations
or things you want to do it can be very
different for all of us you know maybe
some of us would want to make a big make
a parents proud on a lot of money maybe
travel the world do a lot of social good
can be very very different you know but
what&#39;s common in all of these reserved
you want to be able to be successful
successful in these arenas and I&#39;m not
saying I&#39;ll be able to run behind money
I&#39;m saying you ought to be able to make
success surely achieve what you want to
achieve now that could be very very
different and of course which is shaped
by you know where you&#39;re coming from
your culture or your parents your
teachers your schooling your society all
these shapes who you really you know the
kind of information that you get
exposure to and shapes also are
influences who you&#39;d want to become like
if you&#39;ve never seen a pilot if you&#39;ve
never seen a plane you never want to be
a pilot or a plane you know if you&#39;ve
seen you know Bollywood Hollywood heroes
you may want to be what like one but
you&#39;ve never seen a movie then you never
want to be like one you know so all of
us want something or the other in life
and we have a general idea of where we
want to go but what happens is even when
we have a general idea in reality you
know for a lot of you students audio we
become at a point where we get stuck in
some ways you know we don&#39;t know what
we&#39;ve really got to do what which is the
direction that you should take you know
and we don&#39;t make a lot of progress or
oftentimes we know what you have to do
but there&#39;s there&#39;s so many things
happening you know like these is not as
simple as it as it used to be maybe
there are issues you know students they
have pressure there&#39;s so many pressures
that they are there&#39;s students spread
like peer pressure
as parents pressure there&#39;s pressure of
academics so many things you know it&#39;s
not easy but if you really look at it is
not really very very difficult either
you know unplanned as we make it such so
whatever what I would like to share with
you is that finding your true not
finding your true happiness finding and
getting what you truly want is not that
simple and I want to share with you a
model of how you can do that you know
first is I have seen in my practice of
coaching people from all walks of life
and some of them are students - on how
can they get what they want specifically
faster I have seen this one particular
model helps them you know their two
aspects to this one is the ideation
phase and one is the execution phase you
know if you have an idea of what you
want but don&#39;t really work towards it
really means nothing so let&#39;s look at
the first part which is the ideation so
I don&#39;t have make two circles here and
the first one is your passion you know
you want to do what you&#39;re really
passionate about but we work this a lot
of times I&#39;m gonna explain this a little
bit more and second is you want to build
your capabilities this is the time that
you&#39;ve not entered the real world
outside there you gotta fend for
yourself right now is the time that you
can invest in yourself and the people
who are for the most successful of
people who understand what is the need
of the hour right now without getting
confused with the things that they want
to do ten years ends they start working
on it today hello it doesn&#39;t work so how
do we go about it is we focus on the
needs of today what is the need of the
hour
for example now you&#39;re a student in
eighth grade ninth grade 10th 12th
whatever what is the need of the odd you
want to be you&#39;re really passionate
about let&#39;s say let&#39;s just singing
dancing a really a tech freak at a Greek
you want to get into medical sciences
want to be a doctor you will be Ross
astronaut you want to be whatever you
want to
but need of the RS that you can only be
that subject to you qualifying your 12th
right you get that do you think this
makes some sense to you yes or no whoa
thank you very much you guys thank you
very very much
so you know if you don&#39;t focus on the
need of the art what is it that is most
essential right now you will always get
lost you always start thinking and
thinking a lot and you know that
thinking doesn&#39;t work right if you keep
thinking and don&#39;t make progress is it
any good
of course not thank you very very much
you know of course not you can keep
thinking you know and this is the
problem I tell you and this is a problem
with the smarter ones the ones who have
a lot more exposure this is not so much
of a problem that people don&#39;t who don&#39;t
have so much at their disposal people
who have a lot can think a lot they have
so much more exposure they think a lot
and before making any serious progress
in any direction they have thought
through and they&#39;re like dude this will
also not satisfy me you know I don&#39;t
really want this but this has that and
they don&#39;t make progress in any
direction as a result of which they
don&#39;t see happiness as much as they
could should would whatever so focus on
need of the ow
what you want to focus on right now find
out what your passions are and not just
find out what your passions are these
are your best mm-hmm these could be the
best years of your life so invest in
finding your passions and passions won&#39;t
come to you and I imagine a guy who is
going to be really passionate about
music but he&#39;s not exposed to that level
of music till 11th class imagine in only
in 11th he gets to you know expose
himself or herself to music but this guy
didn&#39;t make it to eighth standard will
he ever be able to see the love of his
life the passion that he is destined to
have no what I&#39;m trying to suggest here
is that you know it is important to take
the next step and oftentimes the next
step is always visible the next step
just the next step a journey of a
thousand miles begins with the next step
and you will always be able to see the
next step you may not be able to see
thousand miles ahead but if you&#39;re in
your car you were able to see 100 feet
of it ahead or 50 feet ahead you move
that much and you&#39;d be able to see what
next you want to make a lot of progress
in life
wanna make it big you want to be one of
the richest people on the universe in
the like on our planet dude how do I get
there if you&#39;re thinking of that you
want to be wasting a lot of course think
of that but think of that to get you a
general direction but take action the
first step if you don&#39;t do the first
immediate step that you need to take
right now take one step and take the
other take the other and that&#39;s how you
move ahead let me give you an example
okay for a passion I will give you that
example we want to understand what
passion really is a little bit deeper
you know a lot of us think passionate
something that you like no it&#39;s not just
something that you like let me give you
an example imagine you are you like to
lose weight
you wanna lose weight you like to lose
weight are you to lose weight well not
necessarily
you know you want to gain height or you
want to score you want to come first in
your class you being able to do it is
that so easy well we&#39;ll come to that but
passion is something that you&#39;re willing
to give your 100% full effort into
imagine you like that girl next door
okay are the girl in the next class and
you know her boss the Pixar outcomes at

5:00 in the morning and you can get

there at 5:00 in the morning now you&#39;re
someone who&#39;s tried waking up early in
the morning but you never able do you&#39;ve
never been able to do so but you know
that girl comes to that bus stop the bus

off that I share with her at 5:00 sharp

my bus is at 7:00 do you think you&#39;ll be

able to reach there at 5:00 yes or no oh
I think the ladies around look at this
look at the girls a lot of respecting
you have energy and you know the
foundation is to be able to take that
next step you know what you have you
need a lot of energy and I&#39;m really
impressed to see that coming back so you
will not be able to do what you want to
do you&#39;ll be able to do what you need to
do what you give your all what you&#39;re
most passionate about what fires you
want what lights you up so you want to
find out what your passion is and move
through do what the need of the are is
do what is right right now so that
you&#39;re able to explore as much as
possible while in your an institution
like this which gives you so much
exposure to explore what all there is
and then
you might think that this resonates with
who who you are
second is building capability in
yourself this is extremely important you
don&#39;t just wanna have passion now I have
a lot of passion I want to be a singer
but hello you open your mouth and you
sound like a you know anyway dude you
ain&#39;t a smooth you know you know what I
was going to say but anyway capabilities
this is the time that you got to invest
in yourself and this is gonna make a lot
of sense when I tell you the third
aspect okay which is the most essential
so pay attention here your capabilities
this is the one you know the only time
they you get so much exposure and people
investing in yourself allow them to
invest in you make the best of this time
invest in yourself build your attitude
your skills your knowledge let me give
you an example of this lady this lady
was born from you know very very I won&#39;t
even call it humble this is what she was
born in extreme poverty when she was
nine she was raped by a 19-year cousin
and other men in the family who her
family trusted this lady from extreme
poverty had almost no hope now this
would she would have given up but she
did she took the next step she believed
in herself she won&#39;t give up she
believed in herself and the possibility
of a brighter future she moved ahead she
just took the next step I don&#39;t know
she took the next step went ahead had an
abuser like she was physically abused
sexually abused molested multiple times
multiple times she was pregnant okay and
and this lady was born to an unwed
teenage mother so this is her mother and
this is her and she gets pregnant too at
around 13 or 14 years of age the
daughter and this the child dies in
infancy she grows up
young ladies gentlemen to become Oprah
Winfrey you forever you know who she&#39;s
my hero
look at that coming from what background
but you know what when she was in school
she didn&#39;t just do anything she
focused she focused and did whatever she
likes she liked extemporize she liked
she participated in debates she could
speak really well and she did she just
did that but she did not leave studies
for it she knew that this is essential
this is what I love doing so she would
do that and she would learn to
experience to expand her brain now of
course what you learn you may not be all
useful you don&#39;t you may not use
Pythagoras theorem in running our life
or whatever job you do but of course it
stretches the limits of your brains and
that what really helps you in stretching
your limits of the brain and you you&#39;re
able to think so much more so much so
much broader and so many others so many
other streams anyway coming back so this
lady use those opportunities provided
for us by her school she was extremely
smart she could speak really well she
took the first opportunity that came her
way she didn&#39;t know that she&#39;s gonna be
Oprah Winfrey that we know today the
richest african-american lady on planet
earth there&#39;s not been one another now
coming back so she got whatever she got
whatever she loved doing she just did
that didn&#39;t lose the sight of the basics
need of the hours she passed school she
passed school with great marks that is
essential need of the a but she pursued
what she loved and when you do what you
love how do you feel good well you love
it you love it thank you very much you
love it you feel so I and and what do
you do when you feeling good what then
you do work after you feeling good your
work is also better or worse oh my
goodness I I feel like I&#39;m talking to
her at Lancers International I didn&#39;t
see that energy in the beginning thank
you very much all of you so what I&#39;m
saying here is that you know she didn&#39;t
know that she&#39;s gonna be Oprah Winfrey
she didn&#39;t know that she&#39;s gonna be an
orator like she could she would have
such great skills in speaking but she
just did what she liked and and then
furthered it further if further did she
she got an opportunity while she was in
school she got an opportunity to speak
at a local radio station she grabbed
that opportunity because she loved doing
it and that&#39;s it she was passionate
about it and she was confident she built
that competency in school by
participating in debates but you know
what a lot of us here have issues we
don&#39;t participate you know like oh I&#39;m a
little shy I&#39;m a little introvert I I
want
what&#39;ll people think about me dude these
guys have not thought about themselves
all the thing about you you know
so the wondering to say is that don&#39;t
think about what the world will think
about you think about you you&#39;re the
runner you&#39;re the person running your
life either you run your life or life
runs you and life means everything
around you that runs you you want
everything to run you or you run you you
love you okay thank you very much sir
you won&#39;t run you right you don&#39;t want
these everybody else running you the TV
the media the society the the parents
and the samajis parents and whoever
likes are Maddie&#39;s son daughter whoever
anyway coming back so you focus on your
attitude added you to grow and your
attitude to grow is humble is humility
is humility people will only let you
grow as much as long as you are humble
our problem-free was surely she was
sharp as a knife but she was humble as
anything
she was really humble that is why people
will let her grow and I imagine if Oprah
Winfrey had an attitude one day do you
think your teachers would let her
participate in debates of course not
they&#39;d be like dude this this one is
getting off the air like you know this
one is losing a brain or she gonna focus
a I imagine she won&#39;t focus on education
do you think of parents would have a
louder to continue with debates of
course not thank you very very much
do you guys are smart thank you very
much let&#39;s come back so the attitude
that you need to be successful in
whatever you want to do it could be
public service or social-service is you
wanna have humility a lot of humility
when you&#39;re humble your teachers would
want to help you if you go show attitude
your teacher your teachers gonna say to
hell with you anyway coming back skills
you want to develop as many skills as
possible you know explore the entire
book you participate what&#39;s gonna happen
are you going to die participating in an
in an exclamation in extempore
competition or any debate competition at
most you&#39;ll make a fool of yourself like
I have made many times but that is what
has got me here I won&#39;t have been here
if I if I was like oh what are they
going to think about me
do her with all of you I&#39;m not here to
impress you of course I&#39;m here I&#39;m here
because I didn&#39;t get I didn&#39;t care about
you guys
I cared about me thank you very much
thank you very much I care about me
because I want to do something in my
life I couldn&#39;t speak proper English
when I couldn&#39;t speak proper English
people made fun of me you know what I
spoke English for three years straight
people made fun of me but you know what
I am far far far ahead from every single
person who made fun of me and I say this
with a lot of humility and a lot of
respect for I being fortunate and
blessed to have had the parents who
supported me a lot will you take whose
whatever I wanted to do with only one
condition that son do whatever you want
to do but be the best at it and that
gave me the most important part of this
puzzle which is one is this for you as
students but going forward you want to
look at there is two things in this
picture one is UN one is society you
want to focus on first you you know
focus on you in lesson you don&#39;t think
you know how we approach things can also
be like that one is not doing this this
one is not doing this I&#39;m not getting
marks because this one is not doing that
my teacher is stupid my principals
doesn&#39;t care my whatever like you can
blame the entire world but surely the
smart ones know that it is about it is
about you so I will not let anything I
will not let anything come in my way
if the teachers have said a difficult
paper she&#39;s got to set it from the book
right she&#39;s from the book I&#39;m going to
take this whole thing down and if you
focus on one thing you will get what you
want and nothing you take it away let me
tell you this another example there was
lady who was thrown off in her 20s she
was thrown off a moving train because
robbers tried to snatch a gold chain
from her that was gifted to her she was
thrown off a running train she fell on
another track and 49 trains passed on
that track over her one leg okay she
lost that leg and you know railway
tracks they are rodents they&#39;re like
like this big okay this big and she was
bleeding all through she lost her leg
you know this one couldn&#39;t barely move
you know people do go to the hospital
the next day and what would she do you
know this lady had the courage the guts
to not say that I will be able to manage
my life myself she didn&#39;t say that I&#39;ll
find a decent job for myself and I will
live a life with pride she could
big she said I would live so good I will
live so good
I&#39;ll make an example for the world to
see this lady ladies gentleman young
lady and gentleman I&#39;m talking about
autonomous Sinha she said I will do the
Mount Everest I will do the Mount
Everest and she submitted I think over
six weeks around the world including the
Mount Everest I&#39;m talking about our
enormous honor she&#39;s one of my heroes
again look at these people you know and
I feel limitless what is it that you
cannot do you know ten years back if I
would have said that you know look at
this you know this foreigner this would
be one day in my pocket you be like hey
that is not possible people make fun of
you if people are not making fun of you
believe me you&#39;re not making enough
progress that you can you&#39;re not on the
right path let people make fun of you
let them laugh at you you will have the
last laugh follow what you love what is
your passion I&#39;m just going to wrap this
up I&#39;m going to take one minute follow
what you have capabilities are and what
is the need of the are and then you
serve society is when you get your
greatest growth Oprah Winfrey did not
get her greatest growth because she
fought what she fought in her life she
got her greatest growth because she took
that opportunity served people through
the radio third people to assure help
people get inspired I told you about
Irina marsinah she survived the she
didn&#39;t get she didn&#39;t get the popularity
that she guarded the money that she got
the name fame whatever she could got she
could get because of what she did
because of what she did later because
she would talk and tell people about
this and inspire people she served
society and ladies gentlemen that is
what I&#39;m talking about I am talking
about your compassionate instinct we all
want to do good yes or no
and serve society serve our nation&#39;s of
humanity I really believe I&#39;ve been able
to do a little bit in inspiring you some
way so that you propel humanity forward
and think big thank you very much young
ladies enjoy man thank you very much
I&#39;ve had a fantastic time
thank you thank you thank you thank you
