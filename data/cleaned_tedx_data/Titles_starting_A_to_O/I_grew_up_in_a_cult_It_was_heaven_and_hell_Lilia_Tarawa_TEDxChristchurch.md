I grew up in a valley on the west coast
of New Zealand&#39;s South Island imagine
the wildest most beautiful valley you&#39;ve
ever seen
lush brush the emerges from foothills
into fertile farmland cut through by
pristine rivers that snake down from the
Alps above and the lake that sparkles
like polished glass while the rainbow is
right color in the sky I grew up in the
glory of our Christian community five
hundred men women and children living
together and following the doctrines of
Jesus Christ
my grandfather was my hero because he
brought us to this land and found that
the community I loved purchasing the two
farms on either side of the river was a
smart move for our group we&#39;d migrated
from the East Coast and needed a
livelihood
I arrived at six weeks old strapped on
my Papa&#39;s back to what would be home for
the first 18 years of my life my cousins
and childhood friends were like brothers
and sisters to me we did everything
together campaign was one of our
favorite pastimes we snuggled in
sleeping bags underneath the Stars and
cooked damper on campfire ashes now
earlier today we were asked to recall
our happiest childhood memory my
favorite is celebration they imagined
the coolest party you ever attended as a
child my cousins my friends and I would
order ourselves on pink candy floss and
drink way too much sugary soda there
were clowns on stilts bag rides behind
tractors three-legged races in a plane
that flew over to drop lollies from the
sky the moon built us a hydro slide and
a flying fox and on these days my
granddad would decree a day of work for
the entire community so the women
stopped working in the kitchen and the
men came enough
farm of the festival and it was all free
we didn&#39;t pay for it because we didn&#39;t
earn wages we didn&#39;t work for money we
worked for the lifestyle and for each
other the money we made and our
businesses was kept in a communal bank
account that bank account built the
hostels we lived in put clothes on our
back and food in our mouths and I knew
every single person in my community
personally not only did I know them but
I knew their husband the wife their
children and the grandchildren we lived
in communal hostels we worked either we
went to school together we prayed
together I was constantly surrounded by
the people I loved most and at night I&#39;d
skip a couple meters to my cousin&#39;s room
to socialize or play a deck of cards I
loved working with the other girls in
the women&#39;s realm I loved learning to
sew net spin and cook music was one of
my favourite hobbies we were taught
music in the first year of school so by
the time I was 17 I was competent on
five musical instruments think for a
moment about a time you achieved
something really important remember how
it felt
remember how proud you were in the
moment it probably felt similar to the
day I received my first school report it
was the most exciting day of my life as
a six-year-old I&#39;d scored excellent
grades and even better personal comments
from my school teacher so you can
imagine my excitement when my
grandfather took the school report and
read it to the 500 members of my
community at dinner and their knees said
we don&#39;t want women like you my stomach
dropped
I turned bright red
there was air being sucked on my
nostrils but I couldn&#39;t breathe see my
school teacher had ridden and my report
I seen since that read Lilia
demonstrates leadership skills which
could be useful for when she&#39;s older and
my grandfather humiliated me for hours
and this would become a common theme
throughout my life
afterward I left their dining room a
changed six-year-old girl and what
changed was my belief I was worth
anything more than what he said I was
and as a young girl I spent the majority
of my time with women folk and because
we home birth two big families the sight
of a pregnant belly made me feel at home
my mum grew up with 15 brothers and
sisters I have nine siblings I was seven
years old when I saw a newborn baby for
the first time I took the scissors with
both hands and snip the umbilical cord
my cousin was born blue because the cord
was strangling him so after saving him
the Midwife did a trauma assessment with
me because I was 10 years old at the
time and I held my aunt&#39;s hand when her
next girl was delivered on a mattress in
the back of a van on way to the nearest
hospital dad was the acting manager for
one of the businesses and my mum was the
leader of all the women and ran the
entire domestic realm of glory Val and I
wanted to be just like her when I grew
up
her job was demanding him because dad
was often traveling for business she
needed help raising the children so I
changed dirty nappies potty-trained
climbed out of bed in the middle of the
to rock them back to sleep cleaned up
spew netted them warm clothes and helped
wean them of breast milk I couldn&#39;t wait
to grow up and marry a man and have his
babies my girl cousins and I talked
about it a lot so it was a really
exciting day for me when I turned 12 and
got my period because I could finally
fulfill my purpose in life and by the
time I was 14 I knew who I wanted to
fulfill that purpose with his name was
willing it would be a worthy marriage I
was the late granddaughter of the church
founder and he was the son of fervent
one of the church leaders then one day I
was sitting in class when fervent bold
in the door dragging willing by the
shoulder willing had been disobedient I
don&#39;t remember what he had done it could
have been that he counters here the
wrong way spoke back to his father
listened to music he wasn&#39;t allowed to
listen to or read a book he wasn&#39;t
allowed to read that didn&#39;t matter the
punishment was the same willing was
ordered to bend over and pull down his
pants in my stomach roll when fervent
pulled out the leather belt we were then
told to watch as a servant being willing
with her and I refused to look and still
I stared down at my desk in what&#39;s the
place called maker stop please make it
stop
in that moment
Myra speak for fervent leadership
imploded I knew what he was doing was
wrong
they taught us so much about the love of
God but as I watched Bhuvan beat his son
I thought that&#39;s not love and it wasn&#39;t
love even though after further they had
finished beating his son he hugged him
and told him he loved him that&#39;s not
love I became suspicious of the laws we
were being taught spare the rod spoil
the child the leaders did my blood
boiled when one wife bought her child to
me and showed me the blue welts on the
toddler&#39;s back I gritted my teeth
how can anyone call themselves a
Christian and free a child that way how
can any parent treat a child that way my
friend jubilant wasn&#39;t spoiled it was
born into one of the least privileged
families in our society with no
connection to leadership circle
he was the jokester about class always
saying witty things to make us laugh
imagine your brother one of your
children your niece you and niece your
daughter the one who makes everyone
laugh the clan that was jubilant and one
day at soccer
jubilant made one too many jokes and
when our teacher Nathaniel began to
punch and kick him my stomach rolled
again the game froze and we looked on
horrified and I thought Nathaniel would
stop but he didn&#39;t he forced jubilant to
walk from the soccer field to the main
building all the while punching and
kicking him and Jubilee
sobbing raising his hands to shield his
head from the blows and I thought surely
Mad Men you will be dismissed as a
schoolteacher but the next day he was
back in the classroom with us and I
thought what&#39;s wrong with the people
running this place I don&#39;t want to have
children here not wanting children was a
sin it was forbidden
my best friend Grace was an unwanted
child who mother had given her up at
birth and her adoptive parents shipped
her from the u.s. to our community
hoping that good influence would set her
straight
excuse me she was a chocolate skinned
Mexican girl who arrived in Gloria Vail
when she was 13 just three years older
than me I loved that girl more than life
she did old lots and made me feel safe
so we became best friends and spent as
many moments as we could together and
grace brought personal positions from
the outside world music
jewelry makeup these were forbidden and
seeing him for the first time made grace
all the more special in my eyes her
rebellious spirit inspired me and over
the years grace would be punished many
times because she refused to be
controlled she was 20 when she came to
man told me the leaders had ordered her
marriage to a man she didn&#39;t love she
was sobbing trembling tears are
streaming down her cheeks and
desperation she&#39;d packed her bags hidden
them under a tree called a friend on the
outside to come rescue her but she was
discovered
taken before an inquisition of 20 men
seated in a small room condemned forced
to confess she was evil forced to phone
her outside family and say she didn&#39;t
want to leave anymore and I thought fuck
them no one tells my best friend what to
do
so I wrap my arms around her and I said
don&#39;t listen to him
you do what you believe is right
thankfully her adoptive parents came
through they phoned Gloria Val and
threatened to send them the police of
grace wasn&#39;t allowed to leave the next
day she was gone and she now lives
happily in Canada excuse me
after this incident with grace I knew I
had to leave too or I would be forced to
marry a man I didn&#39;t love and I knew I
had to take my little sisters with me or
the same thing would happen to them I
had one foot out the door already when I
was 11 my oldest sibling ran away when I
was 13 my next oldest sibling ran away
when I was 17 my younger brother
threatened to leave I didn&#39;t know it at
the time but my parents were ready to
leave - but they couldn&#39;t bear the
thought of losing another child they
were waiting for me to come around so we
could stay together after what happened
to grace I was ready to go
I left Gloria Vail with my entire family
less than a year after Grace had and
after I left the cult I became obsessed
with learning everything I could about
human behavior because I thought if I
can understand myself and others better
I can protect myself I can make sure no
one ever takes advantage of me
ever again and as I wrote the story of
my life in a religious cult I realized
the leaders of Gloria Vail used cruel
tactics to control and manipulate me
they began by using shame to degrade me
in front of the people I loved it
started with my grandfather publicly
disgracing me for my six year old report
card his action sends a clear message of
who&#39;s in charge we all knew what would
happen to people who dared Christian
Authority but it didn&#39;t end there
they began using guilt to degrade my
self-worth when I was a child they told
me every day I was a worthless sinner it
was my fault I was evil I was the one to
blame when people treated me badly I
thought I deserve it I struggled to
thank correct for myself because I was
always seeking Gissing what if it is my
fault what if I am to blame now they may
have beaten me down but they messed up
when they mistreated that people I loved
my fury towards the injustice suffered
by grace jubilant and willing gave me
the strength I hadn&#39;t been able to
muster for myself I couldn&#39;t stand by
and watch someone I loved wrongly suffer
love for others broke the chains that
shackled me but why was I willing to
love them
not myself eventually I realized that if
I could learn to love myself the way I
loved willing the way I love jubilant
and grace the way I love my little
sisters then I wouldn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s
bullshit so I asked what does it mean to
love myself what does it mean to love
myself so fully that if anyone ever
tries to shame me again I am the first
to stand out for myself I don&#39;t have all
the answers but I&#39;ve come a long way and
I&#39;ve come to realize that my six year
old report card was bang on
[Applause]
and my grandfather was terrified of
strong women I&#39;m a strong woman I&#39;m a
leader today I know my leadership skills
are priceless I used them to leave the
church and find my own way in a world
there honestly still scares the living
hell out of me I used them when I was 23
to run a business and to write a book
that teaches others what&#39;s possible now
at 27 years old I&#39;m using them to stand
here with you today I used them every
day to remind my six-year-old self she
can do anything she wants to do and to
never Lee anyone tell her otherwise
thank you
[Applause]
