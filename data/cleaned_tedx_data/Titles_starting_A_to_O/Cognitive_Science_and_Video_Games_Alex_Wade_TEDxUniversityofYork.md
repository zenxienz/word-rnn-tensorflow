so I&#39;m a psychologist here at the
University of York and my name&#39;s Alex
Wade and I&#39;m going to be telling you
about some work that we&#39;ve been doing
recently on video games and the
cognition of video games so as a
psychologist people often ask me can you
see this it washed out the question they
often have for me as Alex will watching
things like this make my child a
horrible person and so this is this is
corticon delivering a finishing move on
Cassie cage here and this is a you can&#39;t
really see but there&#39;s a nasty knife
going through her throat and they want
to know if they&#39;re children playing
these games day-in day-out will become
desensitized to violence and should they
stop them and I don&#39;t know the answer
that&#39;s not what I do and I have no
opinion on this although the British
tabloid newspapers definitely do so
the Daily Mail wants to ban these evil
gangs and Daily Mirror opinions as well
this is anyway and so that&#39;s not what I
do I&#39;m not going to tell you anything
about how video games affect people&#39;s
cognition affect their personality
because I don&#39;t know what I do know
about or what we&#39;re starting to research
is the other side of this loop so can we
tell anything about your personality
from the way that you play video games
all the data I&#39;m going to show you today
comes from a single video game League of
Legends let&#39;s just have a quick show of
hands how many people here this is going
to be a league of Legends rich audience
how everyone put their hand up if you
have ever heard of League of Legends
everyone great so League of Legends is
made by Riot Games in Santa Monica right
gamers have very generously shared some
of their data from League of Legends
with us quite a bit of data in fact
almost a million games from League of
Legends or million data points from
League of Legends and we&#39;ve set to work
asking what we can learn about people&#39;s
personality across the globe from those
data sets from those League of Legends
data sets so in the interest of full
disclosure I should say that there are
other types of this type of game this is
something called a MOBA a multiplayer
online battle arena game and I&#39;ll talk a
bit more about what it is in a minute
but there are several versions of this
game made by different company
at the moment they all share a common
theme and you&#39;ll see some examples of
gameplay coming through in a minute so
why are these games especially we think
of psychologists these games are
somewhat special one thing that special
about them is they just have millions
and millions of players so over a
hundred million active players just for
League of Legends alone and probably
many more than that for all the other
ones put together across the entire
planet and for League of Legends that&#39;s
about 7 million active games at any
moment day or night across the planet
people are playing this game all the
data from those games get logged onto
servers and then Riot Games are able to
access those data from those service and
tell us things about the game the games
are commercial they make their money
from events and various in-game
purchases but for example this is an
International League of Legends
competition that they&#39;re playing here
this is a big auditorium full of people
it&#39;s being professionally narrated here
at the front here of the players playing
in their little booths and then it&#39;s
being streamed across the internet and
thousands of people are watching it
they&#39;ve all paid lots of money to be in
this sort of term says a lot of money in
this as well in a professional level
interest the prize pools in these types
of games are millions of pounds at this
point and you get professional athlete
visas to go to different countries if
you&#39;re one of these professional gaming
ears so I could describe the game very
very simply two teams of five people
start at opposite corners of a map and
they fight their way across the map and
they gain territory and they win sort of
objectives and then eventually one or
the other teams captures the other
person&#39;s base and I just can&#39;t really
there&#39;s no words that can can do this
justice it&#39;s interesting to us from a
psychological point of view because so
much of this game is complex it&#39;s
complex in terms of its tactics its
strategy its requirement for rapid
decision making and for those of us all
that last fight is decided within the
fruit
so they&#39;ll be emphasized hand-eye
coordination
just a different class of games so I&#39;m
going to show you in a second about
three seconds of league of Legends and
it&#39;s been three seconds of teamfight and
then the complexity of that teamfight
has been broken down into about a minute
of explanation and I think I&#39;m going to
show you this just to give you a sense
of how complex three seconds of this
game can be so here&#39;s the trade within
the first couple of seconds so we&#39;re
going to slow it down and watch it from
a few different perspectives first off
both casting and reacting to realm warp
requires extremely quick decision-making
while Jensen is channeling the ability
SKT can see the location where c9 will
teleport to however it&#39;s not until c9
are actually teleporting that SKT knows
how many people are arriving once the
animation shows that the three opponents
will be teleporting directly on top of
fakers Viktor all of SKT must react
fakers the first answer and he places
his gravity field perfectly instead of
placing it in the middle of the realm
warp location he places it in between
the location of the three teleporting c9
players then knowing time is limited he
casts his chaos storm
unfortunately for faker that&#39;s all he
has time to do because c9 arrived and
obliterate him impacts cannon shadow
slicing Maelstrom and smoothy&#39;s Alistar
makes sure faker isn&#39;t going anywhere
with the pulverized get all that so
normally I give this and this blank face
is all around but you guys are a little
has pretty close really interesting
you&#39;re all gamers so you can see that
this game resembles space invaders in
much the same way that chess resembles
tic-tac-toe there&#39;s a lot going on here
there&#39;s rapid decision-making there
tactics the strategy there&#39;s people with
excellent hand-eye coordination
millisecond reaction speeds but lots of
other stuff in their head at the same
time when we when I started to get
interested in this game it became
apparent that this was going to provide
a rich enough environment to start
asking questions about personality so
simple games you can&#39;t learn anything
about people&#39;s personality from looking
at space invaders but maybe you can
learn about people&#39;s personality from
this rich
environment so before we move on I&#39;m
just going to draw your attention to two
aspects of this game that you might
missed the first is that obviously
people are playing in a team so all
these blue lines here represent one team
of players and all these red lines are
another team of players and then notice
that each one of these players has given
themselves a name so they sat at some
point in their bedroom or thoughtfully
in their living room and they thought
what would I like to be known as in the
online world and this person has chosen
Bang &amp; blank and faker and Wolfen nicely
simple names and one of the things that
we thought one of these sort of the the
leverages that we might be able to gain
into this question about where the
game&#39;s effect personality where the
personality effects games was maybe the
names that people give themselves in the
games reflect the way they play within
the game and let me explain what I mean
by that these are nice names some names
are not nice name so the faint of heart
should look away now here are some of
examples of toxic names that people
about one in a hundred players will give
themselves in the in-game environment
these are the nice ones that we could
find so we had to filter them there are
no many of these contain racial epithets
or jokes about the Holocaust so really
horrible things and my son plays these
games and I would be frankly
disappointed if I came home one day and
discovered that he had called himself
for example any one of these really what
sort of we saw we saw these names coming
up and we talked to riot and they said
we have a suspicion that the people who
call themselves these toxic names behave
badly within the game environment and
this this is a sort of a trope among
game players they see these people
coming into their match and their heart
sinks and they think this person is
gonna be a dick in the game and right
asked us could you could you have a look
could you see if that is true two people
who choose toxic names essentially in
the real world so people can see them
they&#39;re antisocial so they also behave
in an antisocial way within the game
so we&#39;re directly checking this
hypothesis that toxic names chosen
outside the game relate to bad behavior
within the game we&#39;re able to assess bad
behavior within the game because at the
end of every game of League of Legends
and many of these MOBAs in fact there&#39;s
an opportunity to sort of gossip about
your co teammates and report on them and
that is to say they were behaving badly
they were for example feeding the enemy
team with wins or they were you
using racial slurs or whatever in the
game you can also say nice things about
them you can say that we&#39;re helpful they
were good teammates they were friendly
the helpful nice things are called
honors and the bad nasty things are
called reports and so the obvious
hypothesis is that people if you look at
upon hundreds of thousands of names
people with toxic names are going to get
more of those reports and fewer of the
honors and more importantly they may
also send out fewer honors they may
behave less nicely to other players
after the game and they may send out
more negative stuff to people after the
game as well and sure enough when we
looked at that&#39;s exactly what we found
so these red lines represent the toxic
players compared to the controls they&#39;re
sending out less honor so they&#39;re being
nice enough they&#39;re not being as nice to
other players they&#39;re certainly
receiving less honor so no one&#39;s
praising them after the game and the
opposite is true for the reports so
they&#39;re gaining significantly more
negative reports and sending more
negative reports as well so it works
both ways they&#39;re not just being but
ganged up on by the other players
they&#39;re kind of being nasty to the other
players you&#39;ve lost the game as well and
in the sort of the language of science
we said in the paper players with toxic
names have a lower interaction valence
they behave they receive more bad
reports fewer honors and they behave
more negatively in the reports and
praise that they send so it&#39;s true if
you see someone in this games or one of
these horrible names they&#39;re very likely
to behave like a bad player inside the
game as well so we have this suspicion
this this one tiny piece of evidence
that maybe people&#39;s personalities in
real life do affect the way they play in
the game where could we go with this so
one place we could go is in two other
aspects of personality so for example
impulsivity here&#39;s a child who&#39;s staring
at a marshmallow and what this child has
been told is that if he waits for long
enough by staring at that marshmallow
and doesn&#39;t eat it you can have more
marshmallows in the future children who
are unable to do this children who are
left to learn the room and just gobble
up the marshmallow sometimes run into
problems later in life it&#39;s thought that
they&#39;re unable to discount immediate
gratification to get bigger future
rewards so here&#39;s one place you could go
in a gaming environment you could look
at these events which happen throughout
League of Legends all the time where you
give them an opportunity
to benefit yourself immediately now or
wait and benefit the team or yourself
more later some players may be unable to
do this but for now we went for a
slightly different direction we went to
look at IQ and cognition so if I told
you that a child was waking up maybe
early in the morning and playing three
hours of video games every day before he
went to school you might think that was
a bad thing for that child to be doing
and maybe he should be getting on with
his German homework so but instead if I
told you that he was waking up and
playing three hours of chess every day
you&#39;d be kind of impressed because we
think that chess is linked in some way
to IQ and the people who play chess of
brainy and so one of the things when we
started to think about this more and
more we thought well these games are as
complex in some ways chess may be more
demanding cognitively than chess because
they depend on this rapid
decision-making what if there&#39;s a link
between IQ and the eventual level that
you would achieve in these games and so
you can change you can check IQ using
one of these rather simple paper and
pencil tests that many of you will
already have done we choose this very
standardized test called the Y Z - we
brought in loads and loads and loads of
League of Legends players we sat them
down in a room when we made them do this
test and then we recorded their results
Miyaichi got them to do some other tests
as well to look at things like autism
and but IQ was the main one and then we
just looked at their rank in League of
Legends and this was their stable rank
these were not beginner players these
are players who played for long enough
that they had achieved some sort of
stable level in the game and the
suggestion was the hypothesis was that
the level they finally achieve in the
game was going to be correlated with
their IQ in some way and we found
exactly that once we found exactly that
so in the world of psychology this was a
fairly high correlation we think about
twenty to thirty percent of the variance
in people&#39;s final ability to play these
types of games is related to their IQ as
correlated to the right cue is explained
by it and so broadly the smarter you are
the higher rank you&#39;ll achieve in these
games or another way of looking at it is
if you know someone&#39;s final rank in
League of Legends you can have a guess
of what their IQ is
so his thir is the global ten idea these
games are global they&#39;re played across
the planet night and day all the time
what we think is happening is that these
games are like IQ tests or they like
personality tests every time someone
plays one of these games it&#39;s like
they&#39;re taking a single IQ test and
there are millions and millions and
millions of these games being played all
the time in every city in every part of
the world so what if as a games company
I can zoom in on some region and just
start logging the performance in these
games day and night on and on and on so
imagine every one of these points of
light across Europe or a game player and
we&#39;re just tracking them all the time
and then what if as a games company or
as a psychologist who has access to
these data we noticed that one play
starts to go down in their performance
maybe even just a tiny bit we might then
be able to go to that location and ask
if something&#39;s happened maybe there&#39;s an
outbreak of flu there maybe there&#39;s been
a release of some sort of toxic chemical
into the environment and if you think
that&#39;s unlikely this happened quite
recently in Flint Michigan lead was
released into the water supply and the
effect of come on the cognition of the
local population still unknown so the
idea is that games could provide us with
a way of monitoring the health of the
entire planet mental health of the
entire planet or the cognitive
performance of the entire planet and
ultimately I think what&#39;s might be true
is that although we don&#39;t know enough
about video games to say whether playing
video games affects cognition the idea
that cognition could affect the way that
we play video games might be of global
importance thank you
