I had a pretty all-american childhood
growing up in the 70s and 80s in Memphis
Tennessee I love to draw and make art
but what I really remember about my
childhood is how much time we spent
trying to get out of practicing the
violin endless hours of mental energy
and gamer II trying not to practice the
person who is really good at this was my
brother
who broke his arm three or four times
and we were kids which is the only
surefire way to get out of practicing
the violin he was also the original
artist in the family and this is
something I think about often because if
you met my brother today he might be
wearing a blue shirt a white shirt or a
blue and white shirt and he&#39;s an
incredible business strategist he&#39;s very
successful in the finance and corporate
world but I know him to be an artist on
the inside I know him to be deeply
creatively resourceful and this is what
I keep in mind when I think about what
art is so so what do you think about
when you think about what art is maybe
you think about someone who&#39;s an
artistic genius like Pablo Picasso or
maybe you think about a masterpiece like
the Mona Lisa or maybe you think about
something that your children made this
is a piece that my friend Charlotte&#39;s
daughter Anna made a few months ago
called Kitty shooting rainbows out of
its but I I defy you to find a more
perfectly formed aesthetic object of
2017 I&#39;m here to say something a little
bit different about art I&#39;m here to
define it much more broadly not as an
object but as a process that any of us
can use anywhere in our lives I wanted
to find art as a process not of going
from point A to point B but of inventing
point B in 2004 Daniel pink the writer
penned a small essay in the Harvard
Business Review in which he said a
breakthrough idea of the year was that
the MFA is the new MBA that art and
business had this particular
relationship
this was personal to me because in 2004
I was enrolled in an MFA painting and
MFA program in painting after already
having an MBA and I can tell you they
are definitely culturally very different
if it sounds like it doesn&#39;t really make
sense to get an MFA after an MBA I felt
the same way I spent a lot of time and
what I came to affectionately referred
to as the wilderness years of narrative
and coherence and at the time I started
to kind of make sense of it I was making
these large-scale paintings about the
idea I was grappling with the idea of
professional affiliation and identity
this is one called the guild of
Starbucks baristas and I was also a
teaching business to my classmates so
there&#39;s there&#39;s actually never any extra
wall space in art school so I would tape
up the financial times triple apply to
my own paintings and it wasn&#39;t a class
in how to market your art it was really
much more the market economy is the way
the world works and you should pull up a
chair and not be disenfranchised from
understanding this and some of my
classmates did pull up a chair
I was nervous the first time and I
remember I brought brownies and beer at

1:00 p.m. I to art school in England it
makes a little bit more sense that the
drinking at one part of it there and but
what I remember is one day he I was
opening up the companies and markets
section of the Financial Times and I
said to them you never have to open this
again but you should understand what&#39;s
in here and once they started to take on
board this information they actually
asked me amazingly creative questions
they were really hard to answer they
would ask me stuff like what if we did
away with all the banks and what I
realized that they were approaching the
market economy the same way that they
would approach any artistic medium as a
set of building blocks that they could
make something out of and this is really
what I came to believe was that it
wasn&#39;t so much that I was weird for
having a foot in the art and the
business world it was that it was weird
that we didn&#39;t have a language to talk
about the fact that all of us are
grappling with this all the time but all
of us have a deeply creative self the
capacity for independent
and the ability to make a contribution
that is ours alone to make also we live
in the midst of one of the most vast and
complex market economies of all time we
are all economic actors and we&#39;re also
all members of communities the original
reason I went to study art and business
and to translate between them was
because I saw so many people who were
disenfranchised from both conversations
and I actually originally studied
political science and and you know going
even further back then thinking of my
brother as the original artist I think
of my parents and our father was a
neurologist and our mother is a
medievalist an English professor and
someone asked him once how they got
along being in such different fields and
he said he was in the business of saving
lives but she was in the business of
making lives worth saving and the thing
I actually loved about that the most is
that they actually did the opposite all
the time he helped people with multiple
sclerosis and kind of nerve damage and
scary unpredictability about walking for
people with migraines and she helped
people with what I think is a life
survival skill of being able to write in
complete sentences and she would often
get dressed up in the school colors and
be invited to sit on the bench with
various sports teams where she was you
know teaching people so what I really
want to talk about is how you take this
on board as a process how you think
about inventing your own point be how
you make space in the midst of your busy
complicated probably crisis filled life
where there are some days where you show
up with your better self than others how
do you make space in that for a real
idea of art as a process not artistic
genius and a mythic sense but art in a
way that is already part of you the
starting point for this is a question
and the question will usually take one
of two forms either wouldn&#39;t it be cool
if or how can I make this better and the
idea the question is really important
because what you&#39;re trying to do is to
hold space for something that you
believe is important that you don&#39;t yet
know how to solve you&#39;re trying to hold
space to move forward when you can&#39;t yet
see the answer and you don&#39;t have a
template
you don&#39;t have to do that in a hundred
percent of your life you have to think
of it as an investment in a portfolio in
a small area of your life that you can
return to by habit I often think of the
moment in 1902 when someone asked one of
the Wright brothers if he thought it was
possible that man would ever humankind
would ever find a way to fly and he said
yes but not for 50 years they actually
got a plane off the ground as you know
two years later and I&#39;ve always felt
that if he hadn&#39;t given himself that
grace period he might have invented a
glider instead so the idea of asking the
right question is that you want to ask
the big question that you really mean to
ask and then worry about how to
strategize working on it later the
second thing is that you&#39;re always doing
this in the midst of your full life and
you can never know sometimes which thing
is wasted time and which thing is
central I want to share a story of
Thomas Fogerty as you can probably start
to gather from the picture of him he&#39;s a
cardiac surgeon Fogerty is also owned a
winery in Northern California since in
1878
growing up in Cincinnati Ohio in the
1950s he was a self-professed juvenile
delinquent who had to be either busy or
supervised and I asked him what he meant
by this and he told me that when he was
very young about five his father was
institutionalized and then died not that
long after his mother was raising him
and his siblings by working in a dry
cleaner which he described as a
sweatshop in every sense of the word and
he would get in trouble in school and I
asked him what he did and he said for
example I would pour wax behind the
radiator it would start smoking they&#39;d
have to call the fire department or I
when the teacher wasn&#39;t looking I would
literally jump out of the window to go
fly-fishing and they called my mom and
she had to come to school and they
couldn&#39;t find me
so everyone agreed he needed a part-time
job Fogerty went to work in the local
hospital the only reason he went to work
in a hospital was that hospitals were at
the time exempt from child labor laws
and he was only 13 so there - trigger
warnings here the first is that one of
his initial jobs in the hospital was as
a dishwasher in this
pomp Department and the second trigger
warning and I really do apologize the
second trigger warning is that he he
went to work as a scrub technician in an
operating room for a man named Jack
cranly dr. Cranley had ten children and
sort of took Fogarty on as the honorary
eleventh the main procedure in dr.
Cranley the operating room was the
removal of blood clots at the time
people truly believed in the point a
world that the bigger the incision the
better the surgeon and so to remove a
clot and I&#39;m sorry they would open up
the entire length of the artery many
people died many people returned for
secondary surgeries that involved
amputations and Fogarty said there has
to be a better way you know how can I
fix this and an extreme version of
wouldn&#39;t it be cool if Sohee with dr.
Cranley as encouragement went home and
tinkered and he had this idea that if
you took the pinky finger of a number
five latex glove and a piece of urethral
catheter he could connect them and make
a much smaller and excuse me a much
smaller incision thread this device in
past a blood clot expand the balloon
with a sterile saline solution and then
pull it out pulling the clot out with it
this is the basis of much of
non-invasive cardiopulmonary surgery
that device has gone on to save an
estimated 20 million lives since it was
first invented and the wrinkle is that
at the time Fogarty was working on it
there is no glue that would make latex
and vinyl adhere so he tied it together
with the fly-fishing knots that he
learned cutting school he also had a
very hard time getting it made and the
legendary surgeon al star who had done
the first mitral valve transplant helped
him the company that took on the
contract just copied dr. stars contract
and gave it to Fogarty and he actually
got paid an unheard-of royalty for an
early stage inventor that royalty became
generative in his life he went on to
hold 165 other patents and Counting and
as he likes to say in his pits
the balloon catheter was so long ago
people think I&#39;m dead
they think I&#39;m Tom Fogerty son I want to
share one last story just to to go over
three principles that come about from
all of this and and I realize I&#39;m
actually sharing the first story in the
last story from the art thinking book
this is a building called crosstown
which is in my hometown of Memphis
Tennessee
it&#39;s 1.5 million square feet and it&#39;s
one of about 10 buildings that this
year&#39;s robot corporation constructed
across the United States in the 1920s
the one in Seattle is the world
headquarters of Starbucks many of them
have been repurposed the one in Memphis
closed in 1993 and stood empty up until
about 8 years ago I&#39;ve been inside it it
was a kind of ode to peeling paint
everything seafoam green and coming off
the walls it&#39;s so large that people
there used to have to wear rollerskates
to get around about 8 years ago there
are two guys who live in Memphis who
both had full-time jobs at the time and
they looked up at the shuttered building
and they said wouldn&#39;t it be cool if and
then they actually followed up so the
first principle is that there&#39;s nothing
magical about the early part of the
process it happened in their ordinary
life because they had a question of
wouldn&#39;t it be cool if and they made
space for it they were in the messy
before picture kind of in the weeds and
they were juggling how to keep working
on it while also supporting themselves
they said that when they first started
the project was so outlandish that
everyone took their call and that leads
taken of the second principle which is
that I think our idea of an artist is
highly individualistic almost as a
stereotype and that actually you know if
we had a modern conception of Leonardo
da Vinci it wouldn&#39;t be one person it
would be a lot of us working together
and that ultimately they needed all of
those people to pull off this project
and the third principle is that the
financial side is not incidental to the
creative side and that they&#39;re both part
and parcel of what it is to create
change in the world
this building came about through what I
would consider highly artistic financial
structuring that involved a massive
consortium of banks consortium of banks
the goldman sachs urban investment group
centrist very artistically skillfully
designed use of tax credits and and the
work of all of the government&#39;s
concerned local county state and so on
and they broke ground a couple of years
ago and they just opened for use in
august and so the idea i want to leave
you with is is sort of in two parts one
part is that inventing point b is a way
of thinking about creativity and art and
your contribution that transcends and
brings together your most creative and
most practical selves that it can
manifest in democracy in science in art
and education in the design of your
everyday life for your family and the
second is that sometimes when you start
out on an inventing point b project you
just don&#39;t know how to do it or whether
it&#39;s possible when you start i think
there&#39;s great dignity in that moment
like being a research scientist who&#39;s
trying to work on the right problem
whether the solution is knowable and
Todd Richardson who&#39;s one of the
co-founders across town
I think put it best when he described
their process at the groundbreaking and
he said you know all you can do is shine
a light and walk to the end of what you
can see and then to keep going after
that thank you
[Applause]
