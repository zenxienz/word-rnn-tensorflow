it&#39;s about trusting your intuition you
know down to your core what makes you
happy and who you are
it&#39;s not easy but you trust it I learned
to trust me the last 10 years I made the
hardest decisions of my life and those
decisions were impacted by for
conversations I had with my cardiologist
Kari there&#39;s been some complications
Kari we feel it&#39;s best for you to live
recreational and no longer competitive
Kari you are in stage two of four stages
of heart failure and Kari when you go
into this race I don&#39;t want you to
listen to that voice that says go go go
you need to win I want you to listen to
that voice that says you&#39;ve already won
look how far you&#39;ve come this day is for
you and enjoy it
so how does somebody get the green light
to pursue a race with Stage two heart
failure and what race am I talking about
I&#39;m talking about the Ironman it&#39;s a 2.4
miles swim 112 mile bike ride and then
you finished with 26.2 mile run how did
I get here at the age of 12 I remember
my father telling me I could earn a
scholarship to play collegiate sports
and so I wrote that on a piece of note
paper and I put it by my bed so I saw it
every morning and every night and it
reminded me of what I needed to do to
reach that goal I was a senior in high
school and I was offered a scholarship
to play at st. Cloud State for
volleyball and not only did I play
volleyball
I was a three-sport athlete the same
qualities I needed to be successful in
athletics I also applied in the
classroom and I graduated with honors
and from there I was recruited by a CPA
firm in Minneapolis and I found myself
applying that same drive and passion for
success and I was on path to be a
partner but it didn&#39;t feel right
I just was not happy I felt as though I
was existing and wasn&#39;t living but I
didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do and at
the age of 27 my heart woke me up after
college I continued training in
competing and on one of my training runs
I noticed something was different and I
couldn&#39;t keep the pace so I started
seeking out doctors and I kept getting
the unknown we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going
on we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and
then on another run I had passed out and
I was taken to a hospital and once again
I received the answer that we didn&#39;t
know and so I made the decision to
pursue the Mayo Clinic and this is where
I&#39;d find the best team for my care that
I could ever imagine they honored my
quality of life and respected that
training competing was a huge part of my
happiness they were able to find that my
heart was not functioning like it should
I also had a very dangerous arrhythmia
from scarring that was on my heart but
we didn&#39;t understand how that all began
and so once again I had an unknown so I
made the decision to leave my job and
pursue medicine and today I&#39;m at the
Mayo studying genetic heart diseases and
pursuing my PhD
[Music]
in a big part of this transition was not
only to find answers for myself but I
wanted to find answers for others living
living with an unknown as I was in
school I continued to work with my
doctors to find solutions to my heart
and the first thing we tried was drugs
and they helped correct things to a
certain extent but then I agreed to do
some procedures and these these
procedures entailed a catheter going
into my heart with the hopes of
destroying the heart tissue that was
causing an incorrect electrical rhythm
that caused an abnormal arrhythmia and
in that procedure my second procedure I
had coated on the table I did not have a
pulse and it took CPR to get my heart
started again after that I had another
conversation with my doctor and he felt
it was better for me to live a
recreational life instead of competitive
and if people who know me they know the
word recreational does not is not in my
vocabulary and I knew if I kept my mind
on a goal I could find myself being
competitive again but that wasn&#39;t what
scared me what scared me was death and
that moment reminded me that I could die
and I feared everything I feared
climbing a flight of stairs
I feared any kind of exercise and I
feared I would die in my sleep this was
the moment I had my mother sleep with me
at night with her hand on my back so she
could feel my breath in case something
happened because I didn&#39;t want to die I
knew I needed help
I hit my lowest low I had no hope I had
no confidence and so I had to put a team
together a team of coaches mentors
therapists friends and family because I
knew they could help me find that hope
again and this was the same time I
started using a mantra and my mantra is
think it
feel it see it and live it and this is
my personal mantra it was my affirmation
to remind me that anything is truly
possible in my team and that mantra
slowly help me find the confidence I
slowly began to exercise and train again
I started to live and that athlete
inside wanted to compete again so I had
an idea I scheduled an appointment with
my doctor and I told him I want to
compete he said what do you think about
a 5k or a 10k and I was like hmm I just
did a hundred mile bike gravel race and
then a 27 mile race running do I tell
him that or not so I did but then I said
if I get one opportunity I want to go
big I want to be an Ironman that
appointment lasted 45 minutes and I left
with the green light to pursue the goal
together as a team however with the
understanding that death was the
ultimate and that I could be reducing my
life expectancy and I was okay with that
a week later he called me in for a
follow-up appointment and we sat down
and he said Kari you&#39;re in stage two of
four stages of heart failure and I was
taken back because I hadn&#39;t felt this
good in years I felt like I gos training
like I was in college and I didn&#39;t
understand it and he didn&#39;t either but
we still agreed that we could pursue
this goal and so the next 10 months
I trained 25 plus hours a week tried to
balance my PhD and also made sure my
heart was healthy I never realized how
challenging but also how lonely this
experience would be but what I did is I
relied on my mantra and my wife or this
journey and it got me through
it&#39;s September 10th 2017 Madison
Wisconsin 4 a.m. in the morning and it&#39;s
race day the team that was down there
with me we got together and we head down
to the start line as I showed up at that
start line I noticed my team doubled in
size and more people join me in Madison
for this day and I did the regular
things everybody would do to make sure
everything&#39;s good to go I checked my
bike so I looked at my transition bags
everything was set my friend helped me
get my wetsuit on because I struggled
with that piece a little bit doing this
training and so the wetsuit was on and I
headed down to that start line and I was
going down this helix filled with people
but what I saw was my family and my
friends smiles
high-fives and it was amazing and as I
walked up to that start line I heard my
doctors say once again you&#39;ve already
won this day is for you enjoy it wave 3
was called the sound goes off and I&#39;m
swimming and it is amazing and I found
my rhythm and I found my breath about a
thousand yards in a gentleman kicked me
in the face and I ingested water but
that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen when you&#39;re
swimming 3,000 people but I noticed
about 200 yards later I was coughing and
the coughing wouldn&#39;t go away and then
I&#39;m like just keep going keep going
it&#39;ll go away then it didn&#39;t and then
I&#39;m do I raise my hand and ask for help
and I didn&#39;t want to do that cuz I felt
like I was gonna be defeated but I did I
put my hand in the air and a kayaker
came over and I said just give me a
moment I need to find my breath I found
my breath and I continued swimming but
the cough stayed with me and the
breathing got harder and it was kayak
after kayak every fifty two hundred
yards I was grabbing on to because in my
mind I didn&#39;t want to fit I did not want
to not finish that swim
the thoughts that came through my head
for a brief moment was I put all this
time in and I&#39;m no longer gonna be an
Iron Man and I let my family down
but I changed that thought and said the
only thing I could control right now is
how I finished this swim and I was gonna
finish it no matter how long it took so
I made the decision to take my wet suit
off which is gonna make the swim a lot
harder and I took it off and I gave it
to a kayaker and I continued swimming
but the swim became a breast stroke
because I can no longer put my face in
the water and as I continued swimming I
was drawing attention of medical
personnel because I was struggling and
my cough was pretty much uncontrollable
and when they came over they ran my
number 13 68 and they saw my significant
heart history and so they pleaded with
me to get in the boat because they
thought I was having a heart attack and
I said no I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;m not
having a heart attack
please trust me I don&#39;t know what it is
but I&#39;m not having a heart attack and so
they gave me the go to continue to swim
and then they notice it kept getting
harder and harder and they once again
asked me to get in the boat and I said
I&#39;m not getting in that boat so you can
just come along for the ride and I had
two kayakers both doctors on my left in
my right and I swam in the middle and I
watched people past me and they
continued to pass me and this continued
I turned the corner at 600 yards left
remaining I heard them announce there&#39;s
12 minutes left before the cutoff and I
thought geez
five hundred yards would typically take
me eight minutes I&#39;m gonna pick up my
pace that didn&#39;t help so I just
continued with the breaststroke I did
finish that swim what was supposed to be
75 minutes turned into two and a half
hours but I got out of that water on my
own I was rushed to the hospital because
they wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t having
a heart attack I wasn&#39;t having a heart
attack
in fact my heart was strong it was
really strong what they found out is I
had pneumonia
my race ended that day by something out
of my control however how I finished
that swim was completely up to me and in
those last 50 yards I heard them
announce the swim cutoff is now done and
that meant I was not getting on that
bike I grabbed a kayak and I needed to
gather my emotions because I realized I
was the last swimmer of 3000 athletes
but I said wait I was one of 3,000 that
day and to me failing was not trying and
I tried
my inner voice reminded me I am human
look how far I&#39;ve come my inner voice
reminded me of my strength my grit and
my wife my inner voice reminded me this
was a journey to spread hope the same
hope I received
my inner voice reminded me we all face
challenges but it&#39;s what we do next that
defines us
in my invoice reminding me I am not done
I still dream big as should you so I
asked you what
is your Ironman
think it feel it see it and just live it
