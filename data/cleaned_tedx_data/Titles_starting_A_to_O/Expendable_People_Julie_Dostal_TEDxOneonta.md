so as I thought about this idea worth
spreading that I decided to talk about
today I came up with several different
titles along the way one was addiction
for sale the other was I&#39;m not my
brother&#39;s keeper and the other was harm
for hire and I just had to stop with
that one because it sounded like a bad
James Bond movie so when I really got
down to it what I wanted to talk about
and what I do want to talk about is
expendable people you see when we use a
known addictive substance to generate
revenue or as an economic development
strategy we also make a decision that
there must be expendable people and how
can I say that well what we know is when
there&#39;s more alcohol we have more car
crashes higher healthcare costs and more
domestic violence when we have more
marijuana we have more youth who use
more workplace injuries and more people
who drive while intoxicated and when we
have more opioids we have a higher
addiction rate we have more people who
die from overdose and we have a higher
crime rate just ask any policeman these
are the kinds of things that those of us
who work in public health talk about all
the time and today I would like to take
us on a little meander through my little
corner of public health while I try
really hard to not be the most annoying
kind of fun police
the best way to describe it is this when
we have more of a known addictive
substance that&#39;s potentially harmful
inject it into the marketplace more
people are going to buy it that&#39;s the
point right more people are going to
consume it and then more people are
going to experience harm that&#39;s an
equation that we had tried to grow out
of through millennia we try to evolve
out of it we&#39;ve tried to become more
enlightened but it really is just an
equation that can&#39;t change more of a
harmful thing equals more harm and when
I talk about harmful substance
substances I think that most people
would probably expect me to talk about
the opioid crisis that we&#39;re in the
midst of that wouldn&#39;t be a bad
expectation the last time that we got
numbers was about two weeks ago it was
for 2016 for this further from the
Centers for Disease Control and they
report that 64 thousand people died in
2016 from drug overdose sixty-four
thousand people let that sink in for me
that becomes real when I think about my
County that&#39;s about the size of my
County and a little more it&#39;s like
someone took a bomb dropped it in the
middle of the county and wiped out the
population and then some around the
edges
we&#39;re losing far too many precious
precious people what most folks don&#39;t
know is that alcohol kills more from the
same Centers for Disease Control we find
that 88 thousand people die every year
from alcohol-related causes
that&#39;s 88,000 people who what just made
bad choices I don&#39;t think so
I think it might be because we have all
collectively been sold a fantasy that
harm related to alcohol only comes to
those who can&#39;t or won&#39;t drink
responsibly and with that in mind I want
to talk about one specific alcohol
related harm that doesn&#39;t require
over-the-top drinking and that&#39;s female
breast cancer the researchers from the
Boston University School of Medicine
took a look at this issue and what they
found was that every year 6000 women die
from alcohol-related breast cancer
alcohol attributed breast cancer 6000
women who have probably never been told
that there is no known safe amount of
alcohol for females you see alcohol is a
group 1 carcinogen that means that it is
a known human carcinogen not that it
might be not that it could be not that
it possibly is but it is known to cause
cancer in humans 7 different kinds of
cancer to be specific it&#39;s one of the
most preventable causes of breast cancer
that we&#39;re aware of
and who talks about prevention who talks
to women about prevention as it relates
to alcohol we&#39;re really good in our
country we&#39;re really good at talking
about screening early identification
we&#39;re good at talking about treatment
we&#39;re good at talking about cure but why
don&#39;t we talk about prevention could it
be that if we did alcohol sales might go
down could it be that if we did it might
expose the companies that make alcohol
as companies that see women as
expendable people ladies I hope that
your inner feminist will rise to meet me
in this moment and gentlemen if you have
a mom a sister a wife a grandmother an
aunt a woman that you love you can get
your feminist on too because what I want
you to know is that the companies that
make alcohol probably know the research
better than I do they know that there is
no known safe amount of alcohol for
female breast tissue and yet we have
hard pink lemonade to raise money for
alcohol research we have hard pink cider
that was developed to support the
survivors of breast cancer we have beer
in a really special piece
can to bring about breast cancer
awareness and during the month of
October it&#39;s coming we have countless
pink your drink specials to raise
awareness for breast cancer during
Breast Cancer Awareness Month how is it
then in our culture we accept a company
who makes a cancer-causing product using
that product to raise money for the
victims of the cancer it causes I mean
would we would we support a smoked in
for lung cancer let me move that just a
bit would we support a bake sale for
diabetes
let me move way outside the box would we
support a pig roast for PETA I don&#39;t
think so
I think there might be pickets and
protests and letters to the editor and
we would stop it now I get it
alcohol is lucrative it has a very high
profit margin and I want to say right
here and right now that most people who
buy a product to support a cause do so
with the very best of intentions
most people who fundraise using the
product do so with the very best of
intentions there is no disparaging here
but when we look under the covers just a
little bit we find corporations who use
the product for revenue and we find
governments who use the product for an
for economic development straight
jeez who know that those strategies and
that revenue puts a significant portion
of our population at risk now we have
this conversation in our culture all the
time and we should about the balance
between personal rights and public
health I mean who&#39;s to tell you that you
shouldn&#39;t be able to drink the drink of
your choice because it&#39;s overshadowed by
the harm that it might cause another
person I&#39;m here to tell you that it
shouldn&#39;t I think you should be able to
drink whatever you want to drink see I&#39;m
not the fun police I think the bigger
question is this should we support a
revenue generating product or an
economic development strategy if it puts
a certain population at risk I think not
supporting those things is different
than taking someone&#39;s right away so how
do we tip our culture to become a
society that rejects the need for
expendable people I have a couple of
ideas first require that all public
policy and all public funding pass the
public health test it really has become
all the rage to use gambling alcohol
marijuana as an economic development
strategy it&#39;s not too much to ask of our
leaders that they look at all of the
potential outcomes for those strategies
and what we need to know is if a
strategy puts a
certain segments of our population at
risk does the good so far outweigh the
potential harm that it&#39;s worth the risk
that&#39;s the public health test ii be
aware of those fundraising strategies
that make you scratch your head I have a
few in mind I&#39;m not going to give you
the names I&#39;m just gonna tell you about
them they&#39;re real because I want to
protect the well-intended so how about a
bar crawl to support mental health how
about a wine-tasting to support girls
fitness and how about a christmas-themed
bar crawl to raise money for domestic
violence yeah they&#39;re real and what do
you do if a fundraiser makes you scratch
your head well you can use your awesome
power of persuasion to talk to the
people who develop the fundraiser and
see if you can&#39;t move them from using a
product that might harm the population
they hope to help to some other kind of
fundraising and if active activism boy
that&#39;s redundant isn&#39;t your thing if
that&#39;s not the way that you roll I get
it then you can simply write a check to
your favorite charity where your money
will go further anyway and finally how
do we become a culture that rejects the
need for expendable people
be compassionate toward those that are
most vulnerable to the harm one of my
favorite sayings when it&#39;s what I&#39;m
talking about this topic is from Laurie
Lieber and it says holding young people
responsible for underage drinking is
like blaming fish for dying in the
polluted stream and shouldn&#39;t we feel
that way about everyone I mean if we&#39;re
going to pollute our environment with
known addictive substances shouldn&#39;t we
show compassion toward those that
succumb to the harm I would posit to you
that people who find themselves in the
expendable pile never intended to be
there I know this because I was an
expendable person I grew up in a family
that was riddled with alcoholism and I
had no way of knowing the impact that it
was going to have on my life but at 25
years sober
I get it
I do I get it my drinking and the
drinking of those around me had
far-reaching implications for my life
and in my mid 20s I was a fully addicted
human being there is no shame in being
vulnerable I can&#39;t tell you how many
times I&#39;ve heard that the people who
experience harm associated with alcohol
and other drugs do so by choice and they
get what they deserve my answer to that
is most vulnerability to harm happens
either genetically or in childhood long
before an adult choice comes into play
we have the opportunity to make a few
small changes that are relatively
painless to us in order to protect the
most vulnerable and we must do it
together we have the opportunity to be
life savers and we have the opportunity
to move people from the expendable
column to the you matter column and who
among us doesn&#39;t want to matter thank
you
you
