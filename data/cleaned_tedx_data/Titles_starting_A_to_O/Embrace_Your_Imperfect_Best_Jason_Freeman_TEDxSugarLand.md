hi I&#39;m Jason Freeman first I want to say
my heart goes out to Houston
I&#39;m originally from suppose South Dakota
but where your healing is not a
Midwestern accent it was called a speech
impairment at least eight years to think
so the technical name for my condition
has cerebral palsy which means when I
was born my umbilical cord became king
like a garden hose which makes it
challenging for me to say my umbilical
cord became king like a guy&#39;ll hose
today I want to talk with you about how
we all have the power to do I am perfect
best do i improve it best what what
Jason&#39;s that sounds like a tongue
twister especially coming out of my
mouth and especially because so much
within us and around us seeks perfection
right we we want the perfect bodies the
perfect amount of money in our bank
accounts the perfect weather the perfect
health the perfect relationships in
place of you any thing like me you want
the perfection of living and extremely
long in Biggers life wake to 220 or 330
I don&#39;t know a long way this is a lot to
ask of ourselves and an ask of lives of
our lives
I know I started going to the school
imperfection very early on but my folks
turn me away they say hey Jason you are
the best and as a little kid who was I
to disagree with that assessment my
favorite toy was actually shoe strings I
went around all afternoon pretending
when I will be when one day I was going
to be a carpenter lay my grandpa Frances
when they are the most successful
businessman in the in the ward I haven&#39;t
quite gotten to them more successful
businessman in the war yet but when I
was eight another voice started talking
to me my perfectionistic voice you know
that voice we all do and unfortunately
my perfectionist thick voice has never
had a speech impediment I&#39;ve always
understood a crystal clear saying things
like hey you&#39;re not as good as the other
kids at that hey if you do that you&#39;ll
probably fail so don&#39;t do that
hey why do you make that mistake you
should feel ashamed and be yourself up
for that mistake we&#39;ve all heard this
voice wait yeah and as the years went on
I guess what I listened to it more and
more and more
until age 12 a law&#39;s complete say of my
beauty and potential I was no longer the
best to me I was the was and I isolated
myself because because I thought no one
else are the perfectionist boys I
thought I was the only one little did I
know that that kids although me were
going through the same thing and adults
too but I thought I was the only one in
the isolation I I did the only thing I
know how to do I attempted to take my
own life but but luckily another voice
say hey Jason kiddo
kill I know you&#39;re stressed out I know
you&#39;re making yourself completely
miserable but this is not the way this
is not you&#39;re not seeing all of you
you&#39;re just seeing a thing a fraction of
who you are and even though I didn&#39;t
have the words for the time the concept
of imperfect best was born with me doing
I am perfect bells means we give us of
the fear to go for goals and dreams even
though we know there will probably be
many mistakes many uncertainties and
many frustrations along the way we we do
this B because it&#39;s a courageous act and
because the perfectionist sick boys can
can Willy
Willie stifle what we want to do in life
and in phase that we we want to be free
we want to be be free to create what we
want about 10 years ago I was thinking
about what I wanted to do in life all
the careers they could choose of all the
queers I know I want to be a
professional speaker thank you thank you
very much
and the perfectionist voice with me was
likewise well anyone even understand you
that&#39;s crazy
let me tell you has been a twisty curvy
whiny road over the last 10 years but I
wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world
and I&#39;ve learned I&#39;m just laughing at
how I make free I learned three three
things along the way that I can apply to
us all as we go forth I know I am
perfect best journeys number one we have
the opportunity to listen for the
perfectionist stick voice when it comes
up within us and this is a challenge
because it&#39;s not going to say
perfectionistic boys is just going to a
song like fact isn&#39;t it like you can&#39;t
do that why didn&#39;t you make that mistake
don&#39;t even think of doing that so it so
just notice this voice number two we
have the opportunity to love the
what was this voice that makes us
miserable yes love it because those
voices is part of us and it once was
best for us even if it has a very small
vision of who we we are and who we could
be in but another more important reason
to love it is because if we love it if
we don&#39;t love it we go to war with us
and those words ain&#39;t waiting they just
ain&#39;t praying so number three three
once we&#39;ve loved those
once we&#39;ve noticed this voice and loved
it
we&#39;ve then have a choice we can keep
doing what the perfection that stick
voice says to do or not do or we can go
for step by step into our imperfect best
so so we end where we began I still have
a challenging time saying my umbilical
cord became king like a garden hose and
I&#39;m still doing my improv best as often
as I have because you so my question to
you what was one area of your life that
you really want freedom ember you&#39;re
letting the perfectionistic boys prevent
you from moving forward was one day of
your life and in after you got there
please think of one small step you can
do to move forward and I know it doesn&#39;t
have to be a huge step because out scary
and kind of painful but but just think
of the next small step
when small step after another gives us
momentum I ask you this because at the
end of the day we do I am prefer best
not only for ourselves and not only for
the people around us but for future
generations so with that we have one
more thing my folks will weigh I am the
best me and you are the best you we are
each unique we&#39;re my own best
so will you please all stand up raise
they&#39;re way way hand look look raise the
away playing finger say I love you
playing finger
I love you bring your finger create
yourself and say I am the best I am the
best I am the best I am the best I am
the best now sit down
thank you so much for your attention
your story is very important thing
thanks for your your courtesy and
listening to mine go forth and do your
imperfect best
