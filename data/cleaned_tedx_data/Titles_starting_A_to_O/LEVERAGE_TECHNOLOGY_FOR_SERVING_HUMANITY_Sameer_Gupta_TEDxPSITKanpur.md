so the topic what I have for today is
leveraging technology for serving
humanity and I want to share my
experiences and my thoughts around this
topic I believe we are at a unique
intersection of humanity and technology
from artificial intelligence to robotics
technology is redefining our lives in
every single sphere let me share an
experience of mine I lost my wife two
years back she fought cancer for good
six years I was getting her treated in
the US and that was with the hope that
us being technologically and
scientifically most advanced I&#39;ll be
able to cure her I could not say well I
pondered then and even today that we
have chemical weapons which can kill
millions of people in a single stroke we
don&#39;t have a chemical which can kill
cancer there is need to have a paradigm
shift and be humans certainly need to
prioritize sustainance over dominance no
doubt we are in a technological driven
era which is defining every aspect of a
life be it business be education build
our homes with innovation be training
however in the process we should not be
losing characteristic of humans and
humanity I believe many a times I feel
that technology is turning out to be a
double-edged sword while it is creating
huge opportunities I also think that it
has become a source of conflicting
information which is creating endless
desires
endless choices and hence there is a
craving of instant gratification let me
share some examples on this point one is
if you go to the internet you can see
advantages of alcohol you can see
advantages of smoking you can see
advantages of drugs likewise there have
been cases I&#39;m going to talk about
myself if there is any ailment any
problem you tend to go to the internet
self-medicate yourself
I believe cases of self medication have
significantly in last few years and
quite a few of us I think would have
become self-proclaimed
doctors this is not a good sign at all
this can be very very dangerous if
technology is the only source of
information and guidance I think we are
leading into a very dangerous future and
that&#39;s why I keep saying that let
technology not owners let us on
technology this makes me think that
information which is available in the
public domain needs to be very wisely
used and the fact that learning from
ancestors and parents their experience
can bring the desired wisdom and balance
in our life I&#39;ll share another
experience of mine when I graduated from
engineering way back in 89 I immediately
joined my family business on the day
first when I was to go to office with my
father over the breakfast table he asked
me the question what is the purpose of
joining the business my response was to
make money his question was his next
question was money for what and I said
money for satisfaction and to be happy
and I remember my father&#39;s advice then
he categorically said two things a money
has to be by-product of right work and
hard work and be let money be always
your slave never be slave to money he
said that it is important to earn money
it is equally important to earn it by
the right means he also said that it&#39;s a
responsibility of every businessman to
create value not only for himself but
for the entire society he shared his
many experiences and anecdotes of life
which got so deeply drilled into my mind
that they have become a sound solid
foundation for me even putting I was
recently at Harvard just about a month
back for an executive education program
and I remember one of the professor&#39;s
senior most professors saying that it is
important too important for any business
to earn decent money decently
and that&#39;s very important decent money
decently another example I would like to
share now after 25 years my son
graduated from the US unlike me he
wanted to do internship he wanted to
take up a job before getting into
business so before he left for his
internship I thought of asking him the
same question what my father had put to
me 25 years back and I asked him what
his purpose of getting into business

he said 4:6 for seeking success and for
making more money I was very surprised
to hear almost the same answer what I
gave to my father 25 years back and at
that point I thought I wish I had
recorded what my father had said that
his anecdotes and experiences which I
would have happily shared with my son I
think the luxury of constant guidance
from family elders is missing in these
times because many a times children the
youngsters they move out of parental
homes to seek success and evidently it&#39;s
not their fault it is
I think product of demanding times and
the fact there is overwhelming
information available on the net this
makes this generation lot more
responsible so that we can impart our
experiences and knowledge to the next
generation and that makes me think how
to leverage technology so that we can
pass on the learnings from current
generation to the generations to come so
one of the thoughts that came to my mind
was to document our experiences which
can become life lessons for future
generations and one would argue there
are several such videos available on the
net which preaches principles of life
why do we need more such videos or
documentation my thought here is that
while there are several such videos
available on the net what the lack is
the connection the connection between a
grandfather and a grandson likewise a
mother and a daughter is bound to be lot
more stronger I also believe that
learnings from such videos can be lot
more instant and effective which comes
from and
sir than the family members over last
few months I&#39;m trying to do something
very crazy very different I&#39;m insisting
on my parents on elders in the family to
share their experiences and I am
recording those anecdotes and I intend
to create a and I intend to digitize
them create a family app so that they
can be treasures for generations to come
in an era of virtual reality just
imagine the feeling of joy one could get
by knowing who their ancestors were what
they looked like and what their life
experiences were I the very thought of
this that you know has in this era of
virtual reality as I said if I could see
a 3d image of my great grandfather or a
great grandmother and listen not only
them maybe ancestors of last 200-300
years
listen to their lifetime experiences
then gives me a feeling of the light
many of you would have also heard about
kata Lea&#39;s or Shastra this was composed
somewhere in the second century which
disappeared in 12th century and it was
the least discovered sometime in the
19th century and then in the 19th
century it was put into text before
getting translated into many other
languages I&#39;m sure you would agree that
this translation what actually happened
in the second century into various
languages in the 19th century the truest
sense would have got impacted to a great
extent it is like me sharing my
experiences I mean my father&#39;s
experiences with my son and that made me
thought that imagine had technology
existed in the second century today we
would have been able to hear the golden
discourses of Cattleya in its original
form what a joyful experience it would
have been likewise we hear a lot about
good karma in these days to me good
karma is all about love and positive
relationships and to me it starts from
home it&#39;s all about family bonding
it&#39;s about respecting views of all in
the family including children and
creating an environment of transparency
and Trust where we can all communicate
freely that&#39;s Karma for me I practiced
this approach of karma not only at home
but also at my workplace with my friends
and social circles today we see that
children are hooked onto computer games
and most of the computer games have got
lot of elements of violence into it
while it is going to be unrealistic to
get rid of this computer games which has
got violence we can definitely promote
games to impart human values like
compassion love and forgiveness do you
all would have heard about this computer
game called blue whale I think it&#39;s a
very bad example or misuse of technology
leveraging technology for Humanity and
good karma has been my focus over last
few years and this I won&#39;t hesitate in
saying this has really helped me to grow
holistically and establish a very
positive human connect with people all
around me I would like to end my talk
with a famous quote by a story in&#39;
called arthur cells is single and the
code says science and technology
revolution riads our lives but memory
tradition and myth frames our responses
thank you
you
