my granddad had a misquote but
everything you were either mess it up
completely or only remember part of it
he was a regular mrs. Malik robbed one
of his favorite sayings was erudite aid
mentis and he said that it meant
education is the sharpest tool it wasn&#39;t
until i studied latin myself that i
realized that he only had part of the
story straight I have to say however
that he never lost his s for learning
and was an eager embrace of new ideas
last year it would have been a hundred a
couple of years before he died I
remember him telling me about how much
things had changed during his lifetime
and how when he was just a school boy he
used to watch the sailing ships tacking
across the harbor onto the walls
bringing exotic cargo from the other
side of the world things that were mere
dreams and comic book fiction we&#39;re now
a reality from sailing ships to jumbo
jets rocket ships to a man on the moon
and to us
simple things like computers and smart
phones work to him and his generation
almost beyond imagining
ever since I was little he would remind
me time and time again about the
importance of having an education and
would often say to me I wonder what
changes the next generation will bring
well ladies and gentlemen we are the
next generation and whilst we may have
achieved a lot since granddad&#39;s time
today my idea is that if education had
been truly universal open to every child
of every age of every race color
religion sex or Creed the knowledge and
possibilities we may have had would have
been absolutely limitless it was Nelson
Mandela who said that
education is the most powerful weapon
which you can use to change the world I
do believe that Mandela was not just
referring to reading writing arithmetic
but rather to the essence of an
education the ability to recognize
possibility to utilize the knowledge
available in the world to make a
difference and to change the world for
the better in 1965
Gordon Moore co-founder of Intel
predicted that all of the computing
power in the world would double roughly
every two years ladies and gentlemen it
is now doubling every three months
Moore&#39;s law talks to us about the
knowledge that we have in our world
today and it is how we harness this
knowledge in our lives that allows us to
fit more into the time we have thus
almost giving the illusion of speeding
up time itself our world is changing
huge changes everywhere to every
artificial intelligence health education
3d printing agriculture and employment
software and operating system booths
will completely transform the economic
structures and models of most
traditional industries within the next
five to ten years welcome to the next
Industrial Revolution the exponential
age let me introduce you to IBM as
machines simply named Wilson what is
able to give you basic legal advice
within seconds with 90% accuracy
compared with 70% accuracy when done by
humans as well as this it is also able
to assist doctors and diagnosing cancer
patients with an accuracy rate four
times higher than that of any human
experts say that by 2025 the automobile
industry will change forever
no one will own a car instead you will
call a driverless car yes a driverless
car on your smart back
it will pick you up and drive you to
your destination you will not need to
park it to fill it with petrol you only
pay for the trip
currently more than 1.2 million people
worldwide die in car accidents per annum
on average an accident occurs every
60,000 miles driven but with autonomous
driving this number will significantly
decrease and millions of lives will be
saved in the process San Francisco
startup company auto made headlines last
year for completing the world&#39;s first
shipment myself driving truck thanks to
a $30,000 retrofit on the 20th October
2016 this conventional 18-wheeler truck
managed to deliver 50,000 cans of
Budweiser from a brewery in Fort Collins
through Denver to Colorado Springs
traveling a total stretch of over 120
miles without a driver the growth of
knowledge in our world today is
unprecedented we have gone from working
with short boards to working with iPads
but we must realize that with the good
there is also the bad we live in a world
where a large portion of our population
is deny the one thing and they all
deserve a proper education a world where
two-thirds of the world&#39;s uneducated
children are female educational
deprivation occurs on the basis of
gender as well as socio-economic and
sadly religious reasons recent studies
suggests that in the school year ending
in 2013 124 million children worldwide
aged roughly between 6 and
have either never started storm or have
dropped out part way through and now
this is compared with 122 million in
2011 this means over the span of just
two years the amount of uneducated
people in our world has grown by two
million it is unfathomable that such a
prolific number of people cannot attain
the education but they require for a
better future in this contemporary world
about if they say that knowledge is
power and how could they don&#39;t realize
it is most powerful when it is shared
education deserves to be universal it
deserves to be deserved by all children
with disabilities I perhaps some of
those vulnerable and excluded people in
the world hidden at home or placed in
special institutions a child with a
disability often misses out on having a
decent education be less likely to
attend school and inevitably will most
likely never progress the secondary
school often times they suffered a
double disability of physical and
economic deprivation and as granddad
used to say therein lies the rub for
denying these millions of next
generation children will not only have a
lifelong impact upon their learning
achievement and employment opportunities
it will also be denying us the knowledge
that they would have added to our world
this in turn will hinder how potential
scientific economic social and human
development thus putting the brakes on
Moore&#39;s law of exponential knowledge
ladies and gentlemen I come to you today
to put forward a simple idea what in
from the very beginning every human
being on earth had access to an
education
imagine a parallel universe an alternate
timeline if you will where every man
woman and child regardless of race
gender religion or social status have
access to an education a world where a
young girl is not prohibited from going
to school simply because she&#39;s a girl a
world where any boy can attain the
education of they deserve despite their
disability a world where we&#39;ve made use
of all of this untapped potential that
has been lying dormant for so long
granddad used to watch the sailing ships
coming in from the other side of the
world and I can stand here and access a
Smithsonian on my smartphone so let&#39;s
dive down this rabbit hole and imagine
what kind of lives would be laying well
we&#39;re not were landscape you like what
would our universe be how many more
Picasso&#39;s beethoven&#39;s would we have how
many more Marie Curie&#39;s and sanzu cheese
tip may Temple Grandin&#39;s mother teresa&#39;s
what we have
would we have flying cars hoverboards
that actually hold it would we have
discovered a cure for cancer with the
state of origin instead of being Queens
and versus New South Wales be Mars
versus Neptune as a student of economics
I have learned about something called
the production possibility curve a
graphical model that economists use in
everyday thinking to illustrate how the
allocation of our resources would impact
our society sadly we are not using our
resources to their fullest potential but
if we make use of all this untapped
this would cause the production
possibility curve to expand thus receive
resulting in unprecedented increases in
employment economic competition
productivity efficiency and it will also
improve our overall standard of living
research suggests that 65 low and
middle-income countries
lose around 92 billion dollars per year
by failing to educate girls for the same
standard as boys as well as this it has
been proven that if all children in
low-income countries where to obtain
basic reading skills in school then
well poverty would reduce by 12% as well
as this recent UNESCO data confirms that
if all mothers across the globe we&#39;re to
attain a primary education then maternal
deaths would be reduced by two-thirds
these however are all just hypotheticals
unless anybody here in the audience has
a time machine handy we are unable to
reach this parallel universe to go to
this different time line all we have is
now the most important thing that we
need to remember is that the only
difference between those who have access
to an education and those who don&#39;t is
their place of birth the only difference
between literate people like ourselves
and those who are being deprived the
education that they deserve is our
privilege so let us use this privilege
house to raise our voices and enable the
shackle then deprive to finally be heard
with education we can throw light upon
oppression and fundamentalism but
bigotry ignorance and Prejudice cannot
thrive in the day
oh and by the way for those of you who
are wondering about grandad the actual
saying was Mets arrow dieter essed
a cootie Seymour tell them Bela Torres
and the proper translation was an
educated mind is a warrior&#39;s sharpest
weapon thank you
you
[Applause]
