I woke up on December 23rd 2015
frigid with Dakota Frost covering the
inside of the tent every time we moved
the frost flakes off and snows down on
top of us we&#39;re at 18,000 feet at Camp 2
on aconcagua South America&#39;s highest
peak
we&#39;d been stuck here for two days
already and we had at least another day
before we climb again outside the
temperature sits at about ten below and
the wind is whipping ahead about 50 to
60 miles an hour inside of our tent my
climbing partner Rob Marshall and I are
cocooned in six inches of down stuffing
inside of our sleeping bags with just
our faces poking out this is equally one
of the most miserable days of my life
and one of the most fun the next day one
of our climbing crew who&#39;d been
suffering a severe headache and a
debilitating nausea decides to turn back
her out there to sickness had gotten
worse overnight instead of getting
better as we had all hoped so when we
when she headed down to base camp we
went up to camp three and 20,000 feet we
didn&#39;t sleep that night we rose around
midnight to eat our breakfast of stale
crackers and stale dry cereal
we left our tent at about one o&#39;clock
but even with a high level of exertion
some of the fanciest climbing gear we
still struggle to keep warm the Sun
rises at about 6 a.m. but on the other
side of the mountain so we can see the
sun&#39;s rays hitting the peaks all around
us but we still stay in the mountains
shadow for another three hours we&#39;d
expected cold but nothing like this it&#39;s
an interesting thing about the mountains
is they&#39;re very seasonal in December in
the northern hemisphere nobody&#39;s above
18,000 feet the conditions are just too
harsh and they would perish pretty
quickly where we&#39;re at on aconcagua is
in the southern hemisphere
and we were currently hitting the front
side of a two to three-month weather
window in which aconcagua was able to be
climbed this also happens to be one of
the Seven Summits of the world
so we had our work cut out for it to say
the least well after months of training
and planning and 16 days of climbing we
stood twenty-two thousand eight hundred
and thirty-eight feet on the summit and
for a brief moment each of us was the
highest human being alive on the planet
I&#39;m here to talk about climbing climbing
a mountain is actually quite simple a
lot of people will dismiss it but really
if you break it down it&#39;s doable you&#39;d
have the right perspective on the climb
you got to train for it we have to work
for it and we have to have a good team
but the actual act of climbing a
mountain is really quite simple and I&#39;m
going to show you are you ready you
missed it didn&#39;t you
I&#39;ll show you again but this time I&#39;ll
slow it down there it is putting one
foot in front of the other it&#39;s really
that simple
moving forward always moving forward
being further ahead than we were ten
minutes ago ten hours ago ten days ago
on a mountain we&#39;re there climbing or
freezing to death
nobody&#39;s gonna carry us to the top but
it&#39;s really quite simple as long as we
break it down the first thing that we
need to do is get perspective on our
challenge a lot of people dismiss
mountain climbing as impossible saying I
could never do that
could never more accurately will never
but do we really mean never American
cultures really let her language run
rampant we use intensely inflammatory
words to describe mundane things
comedian Lewis CK does a great bit about
this about how Americans go for the top
shelf words right away like dude that
was amazing
really you were amazed you were amazed
by a basket of chicken wings I have a
migraine really are you unable to be
exposed to even a pinprick of light are
you vomiting are you hallucinating you
might just have a bad headache my
personal favorite I&#39;m dehydrated
probably thirsty as we sit here tonight
we&#39;re all gonna be taking down notes
about ideas that we want to implement in
our lives and in our organizations now
some of these things are going to make
the list and others are going to be
dismissed claiming to be impossible well
we can either change our goals or we can
change our circumstances to make those
goals possible let&#39;s take a simple
everyday mountain like losing weight
oh that&#39;s such a mountain
ever say that I did in fact a year
before I climbed my first mountain I was
240 pounds a 2 pack a day smoker
I couldn&#39;t climb to a third-floor
apartment without trying to catch my
breath for 2 to 3 minutes let alone even
run a quarter-mile why I decided to
start making some changes in my life I
went to the gym started watching 180 I
quit drinking soda the weight was
falling off of me and the more weight I
lost the more ability I discovered I had
you see I was never a threat ik in
school never good at sports
I was never even really all that
coordinated but as I continue my journey
a friend of mine was planning a trip to
Mount Rainier and I asked him if I could
tag along and if he thought I could do
it he said yeah I signed up I lost more
weight I went to the gym when I was
tired
I went to the gym when I was bored I
find every resource I can to try to
learn about mountain climbing and when I
got on the plane I got on the plane at
180 pounds down from 240 less than a
year before and when we flew into
Seattle you can see mo trainer in the
distance it wasn&#39;t until then that I had
actually realized I had never seen a
mountain before
we got to the top of Mount Rainier in
two days of doing nothing more than
putting one foot in front of the other
and in that moment my entire perspective
changed suddenly big problems are not
that big anymore
have a bad day not a big deal flat tire
who cares I had had a literal mountain
in front of me that seemed nearly
impossible it took up my entire field of
view but in just two days of
concentrated effort and doing nothing
more than putting one foot in front the
other we were standing on top of it now
a lot of people will look at mountain
climbing and dismiss it but it is very
doable with the right effort we could
never get there if we didn&#39;t train for
it though when I start training I&#39;ll put
a 25-pound in my backpack put in my
headphones and I&#39;ll start on the stair
climber for about 60 minutes over time
I&#39;ll eventually work that up to a 75
pound backpack
doing the stair climber for 90 minute
stretches and an average step rate of 60
steps a minute it&#39;ll do that four to
five times a week
know when I tell a new climber this they
tend to turn a little green and you can
almost watch them go through similar to
the stages of grief and they say okay so
cardio okay well what about swimming
well I always ask him what part of the
mountain is going to be swamped when we
choose our own mountains we need to
train specifically for what it is that
we want to do American climber ed
Viesturs said it best when he said there
are no shortcuts to the top there is no
easy way for the summit so if you want
to do something you&#39;ve got to do it if
you want to be a concert violinist you
have to push yourself or find somebody
to push you to be faster and cleaner
than the last time if you want to be a
great leader you have to find every book
find every resource you can to actually
be a great leader but when you&#39;re going
through this it&#39;s going to be hard work
it is going to hurt
and you may suffer but that&#39;s okay
because learning to suffer can lead to
heightened types of fun
that&#39;s right fun there&#39;s actually three
different types of fun type one fun is
is here and now so think of riding in a
convertible being out with friends and
family or going to a concert it&#39;s
generally short-lived and easily
attained but once it&#39;s done it&#39;s done
type 2 fun it&#39;s fun that&#39;s not
necessarily fun in the moment but fun
immediately after think of skydiving
type 3 fun type 3 fun is when you need
weeks or months of time in between the
event and now to really appreciate it
the type 3 fun is difficult to explain
to non climbers but when climber George
Mallory was interviewed he said when
asked what&#39;s the use of climbing Mount
Everest I must immediately reply it is
of no use there is not the slightest
prospect of gain whatsoever all we hope
to get out of this adventure is just
sheer joy and joy is after all the end
of life to the outsider the path to the
summit may look miserable but the person
going through it it&#39;s type 3 fun
whenever I look back at a hard-fought
climb the pain of the moment has long
been forgotten and all that&#39;s left is
the exhilaration of an accomplishment
that lasts a lifetime it may not be fun
eating ice cream whatever you want but
it sure is fun taking your shirt off at
the beach it may not be fun training and
studying while others are out enjoying
themselves but trust me it&#39;s a lot of
fun accomplishing goals that others
barely dream of we can never do this
without a team though we climb in a team
to serve many functions such as
distribution of gear delegation of camp
duties but most importantly we climb in
a team to help keep us safe and to help
us all reach the summit when life is
literally on the line you have to make
some very real choices
if I fall I need to know that my
teammates can stop that fall and if my
teammates fall they need to know that we
together will drop anchor in to stop
that fall and protect the team we need
to evaluate who we have around us who is
on our team
who are we there to help who is there to
help us and is there anybody on our team
that might be holding us back from the
summit now that&#39;s a very unfortunate but
a very real question that we need to ask
is there anybody on our team
who might be keeping us from our goals
step 4 of the 12 step program is to make
a fearless moral inventory and this is
so important that it&#39;s largely repeated
in step 10 when they say make a
continued moral inventory we need to
take an inventory of who we choose to
rope up with every day in our lives in
in our organizations is there anybody
there who might be holding us back from
the summit and if there is are we going
to be fearless or are we going to be the
nicest person on the bottom of the
mountain when we&#39;re choosing a rope team
we need to make sure that we&#39;re going to
have people around us that are gonna
help keep us safe and help get us all to
the summit the people that we can choose
to trust with our lives on Kilimanjaro
Rob Marshall and I where again on a team
we&#39;ve been on the mountain for five days
and I think it rained every day since
we&#39;ve gotten there and every night for
dinner we had tea either green or yellow
soup and hot dogs and every morning for
breakfast we had tea and more hot dogs
so when we left our tent on summit
morning we were fueled again by tea and
hot dogs as we climb we get a little bit
more miserable by this step we will
randomly shout to each other how you
doing and the response is usually not
even a word just a noise to me this I
was served as an affirmation an
affirmation between friends that it&#39;s
okay to feel the way that I do and a
reassurance that we&#39;re still there for
each other as we neared the summit on
Kilimanjaro it was still very dark and
not surprisingly very cold we were in
middle of Africa surrounded by
rainforests but it was two vertical
miles below us we were layered up in all
the fanciest climbing gear but we still
struggle the stake hold we still hurt
we&#39;re still tired we reached the summit
of Kilimanjaro about a half an hour
before the Sun came up we took our
obligatory photos by the sign and then
stayed for a little while to revel in
our accomplishment and although we
should have been heading down we decided
to stay just a bit longer
and as the Sun broke the horizon the
clouds were just perfect and the colors
were so incredibly vivid the scene was
amazing it was even more amazing than a
basket of chicken wings
our team is currently training for a
spring climb of Denali and if that goes
well we&#39;ll be using that as an
assessment for a potential 2019 or 2020
Everest expedition now these are both
massive undertakings
but we&#39;ve got the right perspective on
it we&#39;re gonna train for it we&#39;re gonna
work for it we know we&#39;ve got a great
team I watched the Sun Rise from 19,000
341 feet over Africa and a couple years
later I was the highest human being
alive on the planet I&#39;ve climbed 15
high-altitude Peaks across four
continents of six countries I
accomplished all of this by doing
nothing more than putting one foot in
front of the other
nobody&#39;s gonna carry us to our summits
but we can do it we just need to keep
moving forward
