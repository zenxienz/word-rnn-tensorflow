this is a talk for my son and my very
very soon-to-be daughter whose lives
will without a doubt be more intertwined
with social media than we can even
imagine today just thinking about I&#39;m
excited I&#39;m excited to see them glued to
their phones for hours on end like
zombies just thinking about an ounce
swells me with a parental sense of pride
you know they say that the average
millennial spends about five hours on
the phone every day a little bit of math
that&#39;s 1825 hours over the course of a
year you extrapolate that out to four
years let&#39;s say the four years of high
school and you get seven thousand three
hundred hours the only way to make that
seem like a modest number is to compare
it to the roughly eleven thousand hours
that I&#39;ve spent on my phone in the past
four years eight hours a day making
myself a better person and a better
parent by making content so let&#39;s rewind
a little bit
2014 my life had a pretty unexpected
change
I became an accidental snapchat
influencer all I do is post a bunch of
selfies of myself and silly doodles on
tumblr and they went crazy viral so
11,000 hour they got better trust me
that&#39;s I don&#39;t want you to think that I
spent eleven thousand hours on those
that one on the right there only took
like 13 I went from having to adoring
golden retrievers to having half a
million adoring Internet fans but I&#39;m
not here to tell you how to do that for
yourself I can&#39;t that&#39;s impossible
anybody that tells you they can tell you
how to become famous on the Internet
they&#39;re selling a snake-oil which
apparently is how old people say it&#39;s
bullcrap don&#39;t believe it it&#39;s not true
I can&#39;t tell you how to become famous on
the internet because it&#39;s it&#39;s an
impossible thing to do but I can tell
you that it&#39;s an unpredictable thing
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy I can&#39;t tell you
how to make a career out of it it&#39;s
unpredictable but it
controls people I see it every day I see
the internet controlling people they
spend half an hour trying to take the
perfect selfie before they post it on
Instagram going through countless
revisions of tweets and posts before
finally picking the right one it&#39;s
absolutely absurd
social media it because of this this
behavior is so prevalent that it&#39;s
giving social media a bad kind of a bad
rap social media is brainwashing
Millennials and your children watch out
we&#39;ve all heard that and I can speak
from firsthand even though I&#39;m not
exactly I&#39;m not a I&#39;m far from being a
teenager I think we can all agree on
that but I learned firsthand that it can
control you I spent over a year trying
to become famous on vine you guys
remember vine you know barely meeting
either and I was it was a complete
failure because I was focused on making
stuff that was entertaining and funny
and I really wanted to be liked and to
get likes that&#39;s all I was concerned
about and it was an utter failure I
can&#39;t teach you how to become an
influencer because every influencer is
an accidental influencer at least least
on the internet they are so what I can
tell you is how I found success and how
I found happiness through my profession
these platforms that had you know once
caused me such stress and you know
depression I was able to make a career
out of it and find happiness and
actually it happened completely
accidentally all I had to do was throw
these selfies online they went crazy
viral and right place right time my name
was out there this is way back I wasn&#39;t
trying to become famous on snapchat this
is long before snapchat was the app you
know today before the sharing before the
my story brands weren&#39;t looking into it
people you literally couldn&#39;t become
famous on snapchat it just wasn&#39;t built
that way and it&#39;s still really not built
that way but right place right time I
got some press and when brands like
Disney started picking up the phone they
are not picking up the phone when when
brands like Disney started googling how
do I snapchat I was the person that came
up and the good press kind of snowballed
and I was able to turn it into a career
before I knew it I was the face of the
pre Little Liars snapchat account which
is the most followed entered
snapchat account in the platform&#39;s
history which was awesome I&#39;m a
millennial I&#39;m getting into this but I
still hadn&#39;t quite learned my lesson I
know everyone here you&#39;re probably
thinking social media it must be treated
with the most respect and care and
caution only the best that&#39;s possibly
lit selfies
I was totally brain what brainwashed by
that still I was trying to kind of hide
myself so I wasn&#39;t being completely
honest on social media these Millennials
they would look at me and I think they
wanted me to be one of them and because
of those assumptions I wasn&#39;t showing
who I truly was because I thought that
they would become disinterested and I
thought that you know it wasn&#39;t the type
of content they would like but then my
life changed in another way it&#39;s four
o&#39;clock in the morning and I&#39;m lost in a
hospital
but that&#39;s okay
because I&#39;m about to be a dad
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here with my heart Soho dancing father
obviously my life changed a lot but I
was so overcome with emotion that I was
compelled to create something and this
is the story that I told from the
hospital that day against my better
judgment my better misconceptions
actually I told this incredibly personal
story
I broke the veil I&#39;m not a millennial
I&#39;m a father guys guess what I&#39;m not 13
I have a mortgage I have a family and
you know what nothing bad happened in
fact it opened up whole other world for
me I started getting new brand deals
with this whole new vertical this this
parenting type of work with different
brands and it was great I found more
success and I found more happiness you
know I said that every day I see people
being controlled by social media and if
you can if you let it control you that&#39;s
exactly what it will do but if instead
of controlling it letting it control you
you use it you&#39;ll find success and
you&#39;ll find happiness by using social
media I&#39;ve been able to become a better
person I&#39;m more energetic I&#39;ve learned
how to play again I&#39;ve become a better
person a better father and I&#39;m a much
happier human being for it thank you
[Applause]
you
