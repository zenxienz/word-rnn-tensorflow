I once saw siding with a guy I randomly
met at a coffee shop and I don&#39;t recall
much of the conversation to be honest
but it revolved around dreams and I can
clearly remember something he said about
switching the lights off in dreams and
how it was impossible for us to do that
like if the lights are on and you cannot
switch them off then most probably
you&#39;re dreaming anyways as I was about
to leave he said excellent Meraki on the
verge of your day confused as I was
I asked what that meant and he admitted
that he never truly figured it out it
was something that a dream character of
his would usually whisper in his ear so
I smiled heading to the door I noticed
the light switch and out of absolutely
nowhere
I had the sudden desire to switch it off
as I tried to it wouldn&#39;t I looked right
back at the guy I was conversing with
and he had vanished
I then realized I was in a dream as I
got out of the coffee shop I noticed
that all of my senses had fully enhanced
the universal scale I stared at the sky
which was picturesque and I could feel
my whole body being lifted off the
ground I was finally flying when I
worked that day I was left to the
feeling of bubbling joy they lasted for
a week have you ever wanted to fly
travel through time go to space interact
with people you&#39;ve only dreamed of
meeting what if I told you is keeping
reality while being in control of
yourself is possible and it&#39;s something
you&#39;re missing out on if you&#39;ve never
had it occur going to Mars
feeling the wind through your clothes
while flying being able to control
landscapes basically feeling heavenly
and being aware of it is how I would
fine lucid dreams every single one of
your fantasies is achievable not only
freedom but sheer happiness are its
greatest outcomes I&#39;m not here to talk
about science fiction nor to refer to
Christopher Nolan&#39;s movie Inception with
all its representations or
misrepresentations of lucid dreaming I
am here to connect my own experience
with lucid dreaming to what science says
similar to meta cognition where one
thinks about his or her own thinking I
want you to dream my own dreams and
maybe then you&#39;d want to thank or
rethink your own pay attention to tiny
details and enjoy higher levels of
self-awareness or actualization the fact
that people can lose the dream is not
under dispute literally speaking lucid
means clear but it&#39;s not only about
clarity but more about control so the
question is whether or not we can
control our dreams to an extent that
they become clear enough for us to start
enjoying the adjective lucid some
scientists such as Daniel are like her
answers this question with a definite
yes before talking about how to get into
that parallel universe knowing about the
sleep cycle that we go through every
night is somewhat important light sleep
stage one and two one might feel drowsy
like they&#39;re floating over their bed or
falling from it during the second stage
the brain starts releasing massive
amounts of energy which indicates that
one is now moving towards stage three
and four which consists in deep sleep
and is during those two life stages that
the brain produces brain waves also
known as delta waves eventually it
reaches the REM or rapid eye movement
sleep which is when we dream and this
the age in which were entrusted now to
get into the lucid dream realm you need
to learn to distinguish between reality
and fantasy in other terms between being
awake and dreaming when you recognize
dreams as what they are
you can become lucid first off it&#39;s
extremely helpful to start a dream
journal so every morning as soon as you
wake up you write down your dreams in as
much details as you can and after a
while you&#39;re going to notice that you&#39;re
remembering them better you can then
look for recurring themes or situations
to help you realize that you&#39;re dreaming
those are known as dream signs the
second step is to execute reality checks
to test whether or not you&#39;re dreaming
so those are actions that you&#39;ll do
during the day in order to condition
your mind to become more aware of itself
for example if you start constantly
asking yourself whether you&#39;re asleep or
awake during daytime you&#39;ll be
developing a habit and like all habits
you start doing that unconsciously as
well by that I mean that you&#39;ll do it in
your dreams only done the answer won&#39;t
be I&#39;m awake and through this you&#39;ll
realize the train fat dreaming also
counting your fingers checking the time
looking at yourself in a mirror would
provide you with a better understanding
of your current state since everything
is distorted and will act naturally in
dreams now learning to become a lucid
dreamer can have a considerable impact
on your everyday waking life in more
than one way not only you become happier
you also start paying attention to the
details of what used to seem ordinary
you gain a greater sense of self
confidence awareness control because the
lucid dream is like a playground or a
funfair
for experimentation the only limit is
your imagination so whatever you can
imagine you can pretty much do anything
as far as your fantasy reaches and trust
me you have more fantasy and creativity
in you than you think you start using
the canvas or the platform of the lucid
dream to gain insights and access to
levels of mind which in a waking state
are often inaccessible lucid dreams
expose our most innovative side because
of the free flow of concepts or ideas
arising from our subconscious many
artists like Salvador Dali inventors
like Einstein composers like Beethoven
and even Lewis Carroll the author of
Alice in Wonderland give credits to
lucid dreaming as being the birthplace
of their brainchild or creativity also
since you&#39;d be manipulating the dream
you can overcome any nightmare if you
don&#39;t like the scary creature tell it to
go and it will disappear or might be
transformed into a friendly one some
people have used it to confront their
fears and become desensitized of their
phobias now let me share with you my own
personal experience in this regard
growing up in Africa it was pretty usual
for me to have daily encounters with
reptiles and to say the least I was so
not a big fan of them one day I was just
arriving to school getting out of the
car that I felt that something was
climbing on top of me and holding grip
to my shirt as I looked down to see what
it was I had the most traumatizing
experience in my life that scarred me
for a long while it was a lizard and
since then I would have recurring
nightmares in which I&#39;d be lying quietly
in bed then see a whole army of lizards
trying to invade it some
them even making their way through I
would wake up terrified and stayed up
for nights on end to avoid that invasion
till one day it was happening again and
as I had gotten used to it I realized
this must be a dream because in real
life if they saw me moved they would
flee and like in the dreams where I
didn&#39;t have much control so this time I
decided I would scare them for a change
I got up and I shouted at them it&#39;s my
dream and I do not want you in it
they suddenly stopped in time as if they
had been frozen looking at me with fear
and their human-like eyes I then asked
why are you here and they answered in
some obscure lizardy language not making
any sense to me of course but anyways
just to say that I ended up having
closure with that irrational fear
because I somehow expressed what I felt
towards them in that dream and waking up
I felt relieved
I held on to the belief that I have more
power over lizards than I previously
thought I had conquered her Peter phobia
my numero uno fear by I guess 90% and on
days where I feel like I&#39;m weighed down
by stress I decided before falling
asleep to become lucid and go to space
I travel upwards going beyond the
atmosphere and look down on earth from
up there
I feel pretty small done like nothing
else really matters not even me it
really is fascinating how small we are
compared to the vastness of the universe
in lucid dreams
none of the laws of physics apply so the
best thing to do is taken advantage of
that situation for instance in my next
lucid dream I&#39;m looking forward to
experience no gravity at all by that I
mean going underwater being able to
breathe
and explore the infinities of the ocean
I&#39;ve had several debates by now with my
close friends about what they deemed as
a waste of my time and effort in
advocating for a lucid dreaming when
I&#39;ve exhausted all avenues in convincing
them I often refer to the renowned
expert of lucid dreaming dr. stefan
lubbers arguments if you must sleep
through a third of your life why should
you sleep through your dreams to lucid
means clear a light clarity and we&#39;ll
say it in a crystal clear manner I want
to be in charge of my life but as we all
know life always managed to surprise us
one way or another the good news is I
can at least be in charge of that third
of my life thank you
[Applause]
