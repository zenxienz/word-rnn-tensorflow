Jerry Seinfeld&#39;s famously said that
according to studies people&#39;s number one
fear is public speaking
number two is death death is number two
so you can imagine when I found out that
I was going to be the first life Speaker
today that I was a little bit nervous
but then I thought actually this could
be great because it kind of chimes with
what I wanted to talk to you about I
want to tell you a story about taking
risks so I&#39;m a theatre director and I
work with young people and about five
years ago I made a discovery that
changed the way I work with young people
and it changed my views on
transformation that is how theater can
transform the lives of marginalized
young people but before I tell you the
story I need to rewind a little bit
so before I did what I do now for about
ten years I was working in education and
participatory Drama projects I taught in
schools in the top 1% of deprivation
nationally and I worked with deprived
young people I really enjoyed what I did
I was passionate about theatre and I
loved seeing young people being inspired
by theatre and I knew that theatre could
change people it happened to me as a
teenager I experienced bouts of poor
mental health and I felt out of place in
my body and out of place in the world
around me joining a theater group it
saved me it gave me the space to express
myself be part of a community find a
home and find the self belief to know
that one day I would be okay and so I
loved working with young people as a
young teacher and practitioner myself
something wasn&#39;t quite right because
when I looked around me and I looked at
the theater industry I couldn&#39;t see the
young people that I was working with
reflected in that industry and even when
I went back to drama school myself to do
a masters I saw that those in training
didn&#39;t really reflect the communities
that I&#39;d been working with they they
didn&#39;t seem to come from all walks of
life so something wasn&#39;t quite working
and even though I&#39;d been part of some
amazing participatory theater projects
not enough young people were progressing
on into the industry but before I could
do anything about those thoughts in 2012
I was made redundant a theater company
that I was working with they they lost a
lot of money and they needed to find
some more the department that seemed
most dispensable was the social
inclusion department which I managed so
I found myself unemployed and full of
ideas and it was when I was sitting on
the bus one day and I think it was the
43 to London Bridge that I thought I&#39;ve
got an idea why don&#39;t we start a new
kind of theatre company and
not-for-profit organization where young
people in the margins are in fact at the
center of the organization they would
create the core work because I had been
part of other projects that I wasn&#39;t so
proud to be associated with projects
that had received funding for working
with young disadvantaged people but
where the real opportunity of that
funding hadn&#39;t been realized large was
producing theaters running young
people&#39;s projects in inadequate spaces
because the main actors were busy using
the best spaces keen but inexperienced
facilitators because the lead artists
well they were too busy
on the core work and even this use of
language the core work the the social
inclusion Club the outreach group
somehow making this work seem other seem
different to that core work so my idea
was to create a company where the young
people&#39;s work was the core work I
managed to get some funding and set up a
company and we started working with
young people aged 19 to 25 with no prior
qualifications who had been sign posted
to us from local authority services
probation teams leaving her job Center
and so on at the age of 19 plus these
young people had slipped through the
Nets of Education and participatory
projects so we started offering free and
high quality training led by the best
people in the industry and alongside
that structured pastoral support that
meant we could take away any barriers
the young people face to accessing our
training now as well as teaching things
like voice and movement and Shakespeare
and working with text we also decided
that crucially this training would
culminate in a six-week devised theatre
process in an empty room with 15 actors
we would make a new piece of theater
there would be no writer there would be
no theme imposed or no preconceived
ideas just the imaginations and the
creativity of everyone in that room so
why devised theatre because of the fear
let me explain without a script or any
prescribed ideas the possibility was
that anything could happen including
quatre
strophic failure now the young people
were working with no different from any
other artist they had an element of ego
and they were worried that they were
going to look stupid or silly on the
first night other people said to me why
are you doing this why don&#39;t you just
get a writer actually I know a great
writer you could use oh why don&#39;t you
give them a structure a theme they could
do a play about knife crime or something
but no we stuck to our ideas the show
must go on that was our motto for the
six weeks in that rehearsal space
because we knew we have a theater booked
for six weeks time for a week and
there&#39;s paying public audiences coming
to see a show we&#39;ve got to do something
and we sat there in that empty rehearsal
room in Hackney fifteen young actors and
a small production team looking at each
other thinking who came up with this
idea and someone said you know it&#39;s easy
all we have to do to make sure that we
don&#39;t look silly on the first night is
make a really brilliant piece of theatre
okay great thanks easy right now I must
confess at that point privately as the
director I was going home and panicking
I was worrying about why did I come up
with this idea in the first place and I
would lie awake at night imagining all
sorts of catastrophes the audience
walking out us being the first ever
theatre company in history to get a -
five-star review for something and then
I had a word with myself and I said just
stop and breathe always good advice and
take your own advice because I&#39;d ask the
young people to take risks and here I
was worrying sits with the fear trust
the process and as for a brilliant piece
of theatre well in my opinion artistic
excellent
can only ever be achieved where there is
integrity and how do we achieve that
goal well we just have to work together
and try something and fail and then try
something else
and fail again and then try something
else and keep doing that every single
day every day making little failures
with each other and an incredible thing
happened in taking little risks and
making mistakes the young people
realized hang on a minute the world
didn&#39;t just end because I took a risk
and it gave them confidence to try
something new
to work with people to listen to ideas
to offer ideas to throw away 95% of
those ideas even the ones that belong to
themselves they learnt but failure after
all wasn&#39;t something to be feared in
fact it was something we needed it was
something that made us progress I love
this quote from Jacques Lecoq era is not
just acceptable it is necessary for the
continuation of life provided it is not
too great a large error is a catastrophe
and a small error is essential for
enhancing existence without error there
is no movement death follows now before
I go on I must point out that all of
this work and this risk-taking it was
taking place in an atmosphere of safety
in a safe space that we had spent a long
time setting up with the young people
over weeks beforehand we established
safe space rules and boundaries we
agreed rules and boundaries about safety
and respect in the space and that we
would support each other to trust the
process
at 6 o&#39;clock when we finished rehearsals
we would go home and we would leave work
at work if anyone had something they
were unhappy about or felt unsure about
they would come back into the space the
next day and share it with everyone and
we would discuss it professionally in
that safe space now these rules and
boundaries were absolutely essential for
this way of working because they
provided a structure a framework within
which the young people felt safe to take
significant creative risks and this is
what we discovered the greater the
creative risk the more significant the
transformation in the young person&#39;s
life big creative risk equals big
artistic rewards equals affirmation from
oneself and from the audience
equals self belief equals confidence
equals aspiration and goals and
achievement equals smiley faces all
around essentially devising theatre
transforms lives this is Malik he is one
of many many many young people we&#39;ve
worked with whose stories I could tell
you about today he came to us referred
via probation services and like many
ex-prisoners he had experienced
homelessness and had even been sleeping
rough we worked with Malik to remove any
barriers he faced to accessing our
training we helped him with travel and
housing etc and like many young people
we worked with he really struggled with
the devising process at first he found
it really challenging especially not
knowing what that final piece would look
like and what he would look like in fact
there was one moment in frustration that
he tore down a piece of paper on the
wall that had all his ideas on it a
moment he now refer
- as his little tantrum but a moment
which revealed his really human fears
about failure that moment became a
turning point for Malik he went on to
co-create a piece of theater that had
hearts and vitality and according to one
reviewer a righteous anger running
through it he auditioned for drama
school and he got in to guilt all and to
Royal Central School of Speech and Drama
he chose guilt oh sorry
sensual I still love you and the same
year he was offered a part in a play at
Shakespeare&#39;s Globe I asked him to
reflect on the devising process and he
told me it gave him the confidence and
the competence to be able to handle a
three year degree and a professional
role on the globe stage so it&#39;s five
years later and every year we have
invited a new group of young people to
trust the process
and make important and spirited work and
thanks to the skills that come through
this devising process a hundred percent
of those young people have progressed on
to University and drama school including
some of the top Conservatoire schools in
the UK that first group of 15 actors
from the first year they&#39;ve now
graduated from drama school and are
becoming the theatre makers of tomorrow
not very afraid to share their voices
and in a tiny way diversifying an
industry which is well recorded as
lacking plural voices and stories so as
I was on that bus that day on the 43 I
think it was to London
I knew that I must be taking a risk
because I felt fear those 15 actors in
that rehearsal room in Hackney they felt
fear even I confess when I was asked to
give this talk I felt fear but in
devising theatre with young people I
have learnt this if we allow fear to
prevent us from taking substantial
creative risks we limit the
possibilities of our own and others
potential and we risk resorting back to
the same old stories in our work let&#39;s
accept failure as a professional friend
and in a safe space support young people
to take significant creative risks and
to make work that challenges work that
really makes a difference to our
industry work that is fearless thank you
[Applause]
