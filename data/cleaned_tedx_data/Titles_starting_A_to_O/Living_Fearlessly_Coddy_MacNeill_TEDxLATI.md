all right good morning
so to begin I&#39;d like to ask you all to
close your eyes imagine with me I want
you to imagine that you&#39;re hiking it&#39;s

dark maybe 3:00 4:00 in the morning and
you&#39;re completely alone to say that
you&#39;re exhausted would be an
understatement so you&#39;ve been traveling
for several days going from bus station
to bus station one hitchhike ride after
the next and once you finally made it to
your destination you learned that where
you were going to stay could no longer
host you so here you are sleep-deprived
completely alone and on the side of a
mountain with nowhere else to go
you decide to continue and after each
painstaking step doubt starts to creep
in you start to ask yourself questions
like what am i doing was this all a
mistake and why am I here but you keep
going after what seems like an eternity
you start to notice the ground under
your feet against the level and you
realize you made it to the top so with
what little energy you have left you
throw off your bag and you crash to the
ground as you sit there trying to catch
your breath
the most incredible thing happens you
see the darkest night of your life
begins to break and turn into one of the
most incredible mornings it starts
slowly at first you start to hear the
birds chirping off in the distance and
II breathe a couple minutes later you
start to notice the Rolling Hills around
you and II breathe
and then a few minutes after that the
most incredible cityscape you&#39;ve ever
seen presents itself out of the darkness
and as you sit there completely alone
and exhausted you realize that this
place and this time is precisely where
you were meant to be okay open your eyes
now I&#39;m excited to say that this story
is not just a story
in fact this is what happened to me a
couple years back when I got the
opportunity to travel through Europe the
place that I was at was a little
formation called Arthur&#39;s Seat just
outside of Edinburgh Scotland and I
brought a couple pictures so that you
can get an idea of just how incredible
Scotland is so this is Edinburgh it&#39;s
pretty incredible isn&#39;t it it&#39;s kind of
like a fairy tale
in fact Scotland is so magical that
their national animal is the Unicorn
there&#39;s another picture now this is one
of the many stories that I like to tell
of my travels but when I tell them I
usually get the same responses people
say man Cody I wish I could do that but
and then they start to list off reasons
they feel like they can&#39;t either school
or work family obligations finances and
to that I always give the same response
I say well if I could do it anyone can
and I don&#39;t say that to be trite or
dismissive but because I honestly
believe that if you could handpick one
of the least likely people to live
fearlessly or adventurously that it
would be me so this is me and as the
pastel colors and the mullet might make
you believe this was taken in the early
90s I was probably three years old and
what you need to know is that I was born
into a broken home my family we
struggled with all sorts of things
financial difficulties drug and alcohol
addiction and all the things that go
along with that we were even left
homeless at one point following a strand
of hurricanes and to top it all off I
was born with a disability
the disability is known as cerebral
palsy and if you look closely at the
screen you can see little pieces of
fabric on my legs attaching leg braces
to me that I had to wear my entire
childhood now I do have to say that I
was pretty lucky and that my diagnosis
was not as severe as it could have been
and through the help of several doctors
half a dozen surgeries and countless
hours of physical therapy I was able to
have most of my symptoms treated but
there is something that physical therapy
and surgeries can&#39;t fix and that&#39;s the
emotional baggage that accompanies
something like this you see I&#39;ve always
been a pretty ambitious child some might
say a dreamer but from a young age I
knew I was different and I got the
impression that somehow my dreams
weren&#39;t meant for me that they were
reserved for someone else someone who
had more money or was from a better
situation definitely not a kid from a
broken home with a broken body and the
more that I live the more I realized
that this isn&#39;t something that&#39;s
specific to my story that we&#39;ve all been
there that we&#39;ve all been in places
where we would look around and feel
insignificant or that we weren&#39;t capable
of reaching our goals luckily for me
though I&#39;m extremely stubborn and I
decided that I didn&#39;t want to let
society dictate my ability so I set out
to live adventurously
and fearlessly and what I found along
the way was that living adventurously
has very little to do with your actual
circumstance and everything to do with
your perspective so that&#39;s what I&#39;m here
to talk with you about today four things
that I do on a daily basis to help me
shift my perspective to live
adventurously
and fearlessly and the hope that you&#39;ll
be able to take those and do the same so
the first step is to set goals and write
them down so when it comes to setting
goals I want you to take some time to
yourself figure it out who it is that
you want to be
what you want to do and what you want to
accomplish I&#39;m not asking you to think
about what your parents want you to do
what your friends want you to do or what
society says you should do but what do
you want to do and then after you figure
that out write it down see writing it
down it&#39;s going to take that idea and
make it tangible it&#39;s going to give it
some meat and once it&#39;s in a physical
form it&#39;s easier to manage and once you
write it down
you&#39;re less likely to forget it as well
and now this can look differently for
different for everyone
and for me it takes shape in the form of
a bucket list and when it comes to my
bucket list I write down absolutely
anything that I think I might want to
try and then a couple times a month
I&#39;ll break out my bucket list read
through and pick a new goal that I want
to work towards now these goals can be
anything they can be things like going
to college skydiving or going on a road
trip and seeing famous monuments or
maybe backpacking Europe or they can be
seemingly less significant things like
learning to ride a unicycle so the
second thing is to shake up your routine
so in my opinion routine is the killer
of spontaneity but we&#39;re creatures of
habit so we fall into routine we do the
same thing day after day we go to work
or school we come home we see the same
friends we eat the same foods we watch
the same shows and then we get bored and
after we get bored we look around and we
see people who are living outside of
routine and we get jealous but what we
don&#39;t realize is those people have made
the conscious decision to live outside
of routine now I&#39;m not asking you to
quit your job or quit school and move
across the country okay it&#39;s not what
I&#39;m asking you to do I&#39;m asking you to
start small do things like drive a new
way to work go to a new restaurant try
new food maybe hang out with those
friends that you keep saying go get
coffee with but you never see and then
once you start doing that it&#39;ll snowball
and it will get easier and easier and
easier to try new things the third is to
learn to say yes now saying yes is
single-handedly the most impactful
thing for me when it comes to living
adventurously you see the more you say
yes the more people are going to
perceive you as someone who&#39;s open to
new experiences and the more they as the
more that they perceive you as such the
more they&#39;re going to ask you to do new
things a perfect example of this
happened about a year ago I was sitting
in my office and my phone bust it was a
friend who had messaged me that I hadn&#39;t
seen in a while asking me if I wanted to
take part and what she called a
quintessential Nebraskan experience of
course I said yes
and I found myself on the way to the
smallest town I&#39;ve ever seen and when I
got there I realized I&#39;d been invited to
the social event of the season
people from all over the state and
several others came together to help
this family with their annual cattle
branding and I got to spend the day
wrestling cows and learning how Nebraska
ranchers and farmers lived and to date
it is one of my best memories of
Nebraska I know right but that would not
have happened if I hadn&#39;t have first
said yes so lastly is to tell your
stories so the more you tell your
stories the more you&#39;re gonna remind
yourself of some of the incredible
things that you&#39;ve done and as you do
that it&#39;s going to encourage you to
continue to live fearlessly and
adventurously second when you tell your
stories you&#39;re gonna inspire others to
live and a manner that is similar to
that and it kind of brings everything
full circle so to close I want to
reiterate one point that living
adventurously and fearlessly has very
little to do with your actual
circumstances and everything to do with
shifting your perspective and once you
shift your perspective you&#39;ll find
adventure everywhere thank you
you
