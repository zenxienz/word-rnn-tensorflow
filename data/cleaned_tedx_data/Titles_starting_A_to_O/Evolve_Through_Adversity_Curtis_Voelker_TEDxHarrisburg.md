when you were 14 years old how did you
evolve wait a minute we&#39;re probably all
having very different thoughts right now
in terms of evolving at the age of 14
what I&#39;m asking you is what were the
major choices that you made was there
anything that really changed your life
or your major choices trying out for the
high school sports team or was it
starting your first part-time job for
some extra spending money or was it
finally asking out that special person
in your class for myself at the age of
14 my life-changing moment happened on a
simple Saturday morning where I saw my
parents arrested in front of me and when
the dust settled I was moved in with my
aunt my uncle through a form of kinship
care with our local children and youth
services and in this new setting this
new town this new high school this new
family this new lifestyle I was able to
experience many new things I was able to
join school clubs activities and sports
and through transitioning through my
adversity local children need services
asked me to begin sharing my story with
other foster care children in my area
and it was through sharing my story that
I found my true passion for public
speaking now when everything happened in
my life I had some great mentors but I
didn&#39;t necessarily turn to anyone in the
real world
I turned to the fictional character of
Superman you&#39;re probably expecting the
shirt to rip off but I didn&#39;t turn to
Superman because he was faster than a
speeding bullet more powerful than a
locomotive or he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound
I turned to Superman because of what he
stood for because he always strived to
see the good in people and because he
never gave up and I realized that
through sharing my story through my
speaking that just as I saw Superman as
a symbol of
hope and motivation for myself that I
could be a symbol of hope and motivation
for others in fact we all can because
whether you know what or not we all have
a superpower deep inside of us a
superpower I like to call the storm of
success
ladies and gentlemen right here right
now you are all going to see hear feel
and experience the power of the storm of
success so we&#39;re gonna start right here
and when I gesture from side to side of
the room from the front all the way to
the very back I need you to go along
with the action that is part of our
storm of success so from right here all
the way to the back if you would simply
start snapping your fingers for me and
our storms gonna start and if you all
start stamping your fingers for me and
the rest of the room and just listen for
me as you snap our little drops of rain
our storm of success is starting and
this is often times how we may feel when
everything is going wrong in our lives
small weak and significant drops of rain
but then we start to meet others keep
snapping for me our storm is not over
yet
we start to meet others to get involved
with our community and our friends and
if you wouldn&#39;t start patting your
thighs for me not too hard not too soft
there we go and if we&#39;d start patting
our thighs for a patting our thighs
patting our thighs rest the room the
storm is getting a little bit louder a
little bit more intense we&#39;re starting
to give back and make an impact in our
school maybe we&#39;re giving donations to a
local food shelter we&#39;re giving our time
to local charities and then everything
just simply comes together if you would
all start stop your feet for me and
stomping our feet and stopping our feet
and stomping our feet the storm is
picking up we&#39;re feeling that power
we&#39;re healing that hearing that power
and the storm is almost at its peak if
you would stop your feet and pat your
thighs stomp your feet and Pat your
thighs stomp your feet and Pat your
thighs everyone give me everything you
got and simply listen the Thunder the
lightning we&#39;re making that impact we
see the power we have and if you would
all just simply snap your fingers and
just simply snap our fingers
and just simply snap our fingers there&#39;s
storm is calming down and if we just
slowly stop and slowly stop slowly stop
there we go their storm has come and
gone
we all saw heard felt and experienced
the super power we have inside of us
now I encourage you all to flood your
communities flood this nation and flood
this world with our storm a success as
we help each other and ourselves evolve
through adversity thank you
[Applause]
