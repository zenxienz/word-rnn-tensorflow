we are born illiterate no way of
expressing ourselves only wordless cries
and we are born without ego neuroscience
tells us that in those first moments we
literally have no sense of self separate
from the rest of the world
no sense of where I end and you begin
later we learn a few letters we connect
them to make our name and to build ideas
and we form beliefs about how much we
matter
some of us decide that we matter very
much indeed others not so much after 20
years as a writer trainer and content
strategist I&#39;ve realized that ego is
what ties together the two extremes
there are self-important speeches of
people in power and a struggle that
others face with self-doubt when they
try to write I&#39;m going to explore how
that plays out in two domains when we
write about something personal and then
when we write at work we&#39;ll start with
the personal have you ever found
yourself staring at a blank page and the
page is staring back did the page win I
know it&#39;s like because in my 20s I
studied creative writing I had nine
months to write part of a novel and I&#39;d
write a Spock for seven of them so every
morning I&#39;d sit down to write and the
fear would be waiting for me so I&#39;d
write blindly try to outrun it and then
in the afternoon I&#39;d come back and read
what I&#39;d done and it wasn&#39;t just that I
hated it I genuinely couldn&#39;t tell if it
was any good or not I had no purpose to
guide me it was like walking to a
snowstorm without a compass somehow I
made it through to the other side I got
my degree but I never finished that
novel what happened the last time you
ran headlong into self-doubt so many of
us just give up or he never even start
but self-doubt is a black hole it
captures our creativity and pulls us
back into itself into a place where no
light escapes
but when self-doubt wins society loses
blogs aren&#39;t written papers aren&#39;t
published instead the voices that do
reach us belong to people with galaxy
science reserves to self-confidence so
what do we do so we try to fill up the
black hole with affirmations to take
what I didn&#39;t see I&#39;m a terrible writer
I replace it with another identity I&#39;m
an absolutely phenomenal writer that&#39;s
not it Kurt Vonnegut once said when I
write I feel like an armless legless man
with a crown in his mouth this is the
Kurt Vonnegut who wrote 40 novels three
short story collections and five plays
so his experience shows us that writing
everyday doesn&#39;t make you immune from
self-doubt just means that you run up
against it harder and more often two
years ago I sat down to write another
book this time a guide to leave in a
public service and starting her own
business and this time I finished it
here&#39;s how I did it I got over myself
see I realized that back then when I was
all caught up in self-doubt I was making
it all about me I needed a reason to
write that I cared about more than my
ego and for me it was to write the book
that I wished I&#39;d had back when I was
leaving government starting a business
and had absolutely no idea what I was
doing see I&#39;ve realized that the less I
care about what I think about my
capabilities as a writer the more
freedom I gain to do great work we need
to stop labeling ourselves with
identities like I&#39;m a bad writer we need
to stop thinking about writing as
something we are instead we need to
think of it as something we do a set of
behaviors connected to a purpose I
didn&#39;t learn to drive until pretty late
I&#39;m right up until my 30s bikes and
buses and sponging lifts off friends had
worked pretty well for me and then my
wife fell pregnant so catching a bus to
the hospital with a wife in labor was an
option so now I had a reason to change
but if I told myself I&#39;m not a driver
then I never would have gone anywhere so
instead I treated driving as a behavior
I broke it up
steering parking changing gears and I
practiced each one the day of a test
came it was also a day that my wife was
June so a crotchety old instructor and I
drove around the back streets of Targa
Nong him with his clipboard me with
sweaty palms on the wheel
I may have ground the gears I may have
fun to curb once or twice anyway so we
wound up back at the motor vehicle
office and the instructor heaved himself
out of the car well he said I suppose
that I&#39;ll do I passed
see I didn&#39;t need to become an ace rally
car driver to drive I just needed to be
good enough to get life to the hospital
two days later so driving wasn&#39;t about
my identity it was a service that I
performed for others let&#39;s go to work
riding at work is a blood sport by time
your draft has been reviewed by the
manager and their managers manager very
little riding makes it out alive instead
what&#39;s left is stuff like this the
department&#39;s commute to the provision of
employment services to assist trans to
participate in the employment market why
do we inflict this stuff on each other
well when I work with organizations and
scratch beneath the surface you run into
this desperate fear I&#39;ve not been taken
seriously and that fear makes us care
for ourselves plays out differently so I
work with academics who are terrified of
other academics because the one bit of
information that they leave out is the
one thing that the other academics will
use to tear their work to shreds and I
meet business owners and marketers who
are terrified of being drowned out by
the competition so they feel like their
only options to shout louder to big note
themselves and I meet public servants
who are terrified of having their work
sent back down to them covered in red
pen because it doesn&#39;t sound public
service enough and that&#39;s why the
writing that comes out of government is
a gray wall between them and the outside
world but this time it&#39;s not just about
personal fear even personal skill and
that&#39;s because the place we work has an
ego of its own a tendency to put itself
at the center of the conversation that
forms a culture of writing and that
culture is holding our pen when we write
a draft and it&#39;s breathing down our
necks when we review what someone else
has done and decide if it passes
standard so what should we do well at
some point you&#39;ll have heard that you
should write for your audience find that
you that you want to reach and just
write with them in mind I wish it was
that easy I was twenty five in the final
stages of a relationship I thought I had
a pretty good idea of what our issues
were and how to solve them
so I drew my girlfriend a diagram and
arrows and everything it made perfect
sense to me it didn&#39;t make sense to her
my diagram wasn&#39;t enough to save our
relationship now whether you&#39;re a 25
year old male it takes himself a little
bit too seriously or a massive
government department that takes itself
a little bit too seriously the same
tendency is there to project ourselves
outwards one for people we&#39;re trying to
reach to think that they see the world
as we see it that they speak her
language
psychologists call us bias the curse of
knowledge and here&#39;s the kicker
the research also shows that we think
it&#39;s our bias other people have we think
we&#39;re immune and I know this because I
used to think that as a writer I was
gifted with a mystical insight directly
into other people&#39;s minds then I
discovered user experience research or
UX for short what it boils down to is
this actually listening going out
meeting the people who are trying to
reach learning their language and
letting them tell us what they need
because sustain it for our writing is
not does it make sense to us but does it
make sense to them now this is going to
be massively challenging because it
means changing an organization&#39;s whole
culture of writing and that culture over
the years is built on habits that make
us feel safe and important so I do it
well when we let go of our assumptions
when we strip away the pretense and the
defensiveness the writing that emerges
is interesting vital and human and for
ourselves we discover this satisfaction
of being useful writing is an active
service
