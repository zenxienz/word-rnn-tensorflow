moodini
hello everyone my name is circumcision
Donna from mother well I&#39;m gonna share
my language with you guys I hope you
enjoy and you learn something new a
nanny which our way which you important
money my auntie this don&#39;t know me as a
man Poonam same is what is a fool and a
piece toasting Kouta undo open and say
it daily your mother she&#39;s the one who
who is strong so my mother is I will say
yeah the reason why I&#39;m here I just
wanna say my story guys I&#39;m Pete
dyslexic because I grew up doing art
moderne everything was at each way I
used to find my comfort was the as a
young person they used to give us a
different class from others and so it&#39;s
okay to lean on stuff so we take in like
that the other car other kids were
laughing at us so I can say that&#39;s what
the blessing in disguise for me because
now I&#39;m here today sharing my story with
you guys so everything the moon shower
with you important money the RTM support
just joy because I will to title my wet
in Casa unfortunately in the industry
didn&#39;t understand the kind of art that
I&#39;m bringing because at the moment you
have to have tools big conceptual
statement and synopsis of work in
English not in Xhosa
not in any other languages so I&#39;ve tried
to do that but have been ignorant
rejected but there&#39;s something that is
once always inside me because I used to
find happiness when I&#39;m doing art so I
said no I&#39;m gonna keep on doing this
even at home there to say no Ockman are
you uh playing you don&#39;t want to achieve
in life that&#39;s worth about life you only
spins with art
fortunately I did my metric
unfortunately I didn&#39;t pass it then I
didn&#39;t lose hope because at the township
in that kind of situation we if you are
out of school you will stand in the Sun
and ask next to the shop and ask people
wandering for cigarette and for
something I said no I didn&#39;t want this
while I was a young child I wanted to be
someone unfortunately I grew up in the
family that is its disadvantage so yeah
so that is the part of try I&#39;ve tried to
as they say where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s
a way
so that&#39;s what makes me who I am
even today briefly about the story that
I&#39;m gonna share today you see this is my
work and the reason why I just wanted to
share these stories because of we
killing each other today discrimination
each other
we no longer United originated there is
no mundo that&#39;s the way that we said one
do in our language but we after him so
why I&#39;m keep as an artist I keep
wondering and asking massive fight why
are we not like we are three now we
don&#39;t come together and celebrate and it
and help each other where we can see
that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do in matter
well because I end up changing my own
roommate home and said no I&#39;ve got a
space where they need to rent the space
in town big amount of tiles and week I&#39;m
a lot of money in within even to save
some time so else guys who were doing
this out of their pocket sleep begging
struggling hustling but we&#39;ve been we
are so proud to be here today so I&#39;m
trying to say guys I wish you can you
can even relate or you can do that each
and everyone is welcome to use their own
languages the reason why I here I&#39;m here
I just wanna see my own language help me
to achieve what I wanted to achieve and
I&#39;m proud of that so I want everyone to
be proud of with the app with your
language is who you are your language is
do or can&#39;t run away from the in the
block so I&#39;m trying to say guys today
it&#39;s a horror and privilege I will tell
the guys they recognize that the Ted
team to be new guys for listening to my
story and the one thing I would love to
see you who into matter well that&#39;s the
reason why I opened the space there just
to say especially will be a lot of
talented guys and kids who just pop into
my studio and and learn so to me it
inspired me with a linear chance at home
they didn&#39;t even support me even my
mother used to say no no now I&#39;m alone
and I have the pressure for the men I
have to support at home but I&#39;m busy
doing it let&#39;s see with this ad but it&#39;s
where I used to get my what can I say my
my therapy at was the tobacco to me so
in the reason why I have this on my hand
because of I want our stars to look like
this and production ethics this doesn&#39;t
product each and everyone who&#39;s here
be proud of who you are be proud of your
culture
just because today we&#39;re changing who we
are and becoming these kind of images
I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s not personal but I&#39;m
trying to say what I&#39;ve been observing
around as an artist is this so this was
so stressful because before they were
beautiful like this I was to start each
and everyone
what like this like natural and
beautifully like and we were so proud
about that but now things have changed
we no longer United but even changing
our stuff so where I would convene at
the nation I think that&#39;s that that
question so I&#39;m trying to say please no
matter you are China no matter you are
Muslim no matter whatever you are be
proud of who you are and never let
anything stop you in life because to me
if I can break down my story I think if
it&#39;s an every room will cry what they&#39;ll
to just live in the street because of
art our beloved art that was the way of
sharing Who am I
it&#39;s way I used to have say well I
didn&#39;t have say because everyone was
laughing at me over that one statistic
CIA no nothing no you don&#39;t understand
so it&#39;s where I used to express what I
feel
what&#39;s inside so I&#39;m so thankful to to
share my story with you and I&#39;m so
thankful to to God like for for the gift
and I&#39;m so thankful like for the
challenges they made me who am i because
tonight is it&#39;s really not easy to
pursue like art is the career person
these kinds of environment as I was
saying today I&#39;ll create a little art
web and I will give it to anyone for
free just to share what I have always
share what I have I have nothing in my
pocket even right now I want to think
how can I go home but what is here and
they will ask me so I will give out one
our check that all created right now I
hope you still enjoy and you still
understand they say in the choice la
policia Sebastia P Omega CRD Kasukabe
so they say if you want you must know if
you to know where we are going
we must exactly know where we from so
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done yeah because a to
that I just sit down and preach down to
myself it Brock now you&#39;ve become an
older and then you will die nothing
having nothing to show nothing to share
nothing to to live for your family you
see so I said no what I must do
must work with what I have fortunately I
have been likely to but during the my
networking have been likely to to be to
meet good people I&#39;ve done a lot of
trainings and stuff that helped me like
permaculture so they say they one of
their they are they are ones that I like
the my culture to see permaculture
principle distinct work with what we
have
I like this so I&#39;m living in Township I
have a roommate a pet so I changed the
room and then I said okay I so on one
thing on Facebook do you think more life
like when they say less comfort mala so
I said okay I must be not comfortable
here
I learned it plasmas need artworks that
will tell the story that that all share
with my community but they didn&#39;t have
we didn&#39;t have role models I didn&#39;t have
people to ask for information l to go to
library and that&#39;s I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m
setting I&#39;m looking for admins I don&#39;t
know where to go so I&#39;m trying to say
let&#39;s be who we are love yourself more
than anything in this world because you
are here for your resume and
I&#39;m so happy to see this is part of
paying to me I&#39;m doing this almost every
day at home just to share and live at
least been accustomed eat right I have
because artists what I hear and nobody
told me to be an artist but I became an
artist
fortunately I&#39;m like II say honor and
privilege to be an artist in Italy it&#39;s
good to be an artist the SEC would I can
say therapy you can relax your mind
relax and forget about trust
so what I&#39;m doing here as I said I&#39;m
gonna give it to someone who is like it

I&#39;m a toss-up from Eastern Cape has tape
matter well in Motherwell matter well
it&#39;s known is the bigger time rate or
whatever but mother is a beautiful place
to be we can change to it kind of
amazing that there are people there but
we need to encourage and show them the
way unfortunately they are in a
situation that they are in the state of
denial if they&#39;d know get up being
creative but didn&#39;t get support to
anyone being creative to something else
maybe negatively
that&#39;s why you see guys killing each
other there ain&#39;t a part of being
creative because those getaway supposed
to be soldiers in support protect them
oh it&#39;s almost okay cool yeah this is
what I want
Jilla our indigenous houses called a
random wheel or heart I never been there
but that was always my dream while I was
young
waiting with you my young colleagues or
peers at school to say I will go to him
cotton on holiday I&#39;m from PE and then
we never called a so I want only to mean
to go to the rural areas because they
say there&#39;s more lively than here
because PA we&#39;re killing each other for
nothing
and then we promoting that we&#39;re
promoting that how because of we not who
we are because if your language and your
culture is who you are
so we mustn&#39;t promote this kind of
situation instead we must like love each
other
care for each other and move forward and
live a peaceful life
I&#39;m glad you also time I&#39;m sorry guys
for wasting your time
I&#39;m so I&#39;m so I&#39;m so excited I&#39;m Pete
