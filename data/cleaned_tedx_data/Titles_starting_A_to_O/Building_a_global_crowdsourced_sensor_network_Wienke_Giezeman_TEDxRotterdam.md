so by now I think that most of you have
heard about to term the Internet of
Things
it&#39;s about kinetic objects around us to
the Internet so we can talk with them
and actually the term the Internet of
Things is already around for two decades
and in the 90s where it was first
mentioned we were promised a smart
refrigerator that was connected to the
Internet who here in the audience has a
Internet connected refrigerator nobody
so a little spoiler you don&#39;t have one
because you don&#39;t need one right why
would you want to connect a refrigerator
to the Internet so you know what the
contents of the refrigerator ring for
about hundred years we just opened the
door of the refrigerator and we can see
what it&#39;s at right so if you start
looking online for all these different
examples of Internet of Things products
you come across quite a lot of useless
items so for instance a smart Internet
connected fork right yep
I don&#39;t need to know how many bites I
took today a interconnect Internet
connected coffee cup I don&#39;t need to
know how many cups of coffee I drank
today I can remember that a toothbrush
that does what helped you remember the
last time you brushed your teeth and a
egg tray that&#39;s connected to the
Internet so your smartphone knows how
many eggs you have still at home what is
this right okay this is a Wi-Fi enabled
slow-cooker and this is not doing very
well online there&#39;s a product review I
was a guy who bought this device and
probably he was thinking this was the
best thing to having a cooking robot
it was very excited
and he came home from work late tired
hungry started preparing his meal and
then he needed his mobile phone to turn
on the slow chords Oh bleep was on
cooking going to the living room
randomly checking some content online
and his phone ran out of battery at the
same time he heard a noise in the
kitchen going over to the kitchen what&#39;s
happening here
and he saw that the slow cooker was not
working and it was because his phone
went out of battery she tried to put it
back on try to search for the buttons
but he only could turn it on with his
mobile phone like this is not doing
anything right this is only creating
more problems so like I&#39;m a tech guy and
I want to make that technology makes
impact and if I look at these examples
then there&#39;s no problem being solved
there&#39;s just a solution being pushed so
grab a business model grab a technology
and throw to the market right doesn&#39;t
make really much sense to me so well
later somebody showed me this device and
this is an antenna and he said yeah this
is for the Internet of Things and I said
yeah I know very unhappy guy with a slow
cooker I mean I know about the Internet
of Things so no no this is for the real
Internet of Things and this device you
compare can compare it to your Wi-Fi
router at home but it&#39;s not connecting
smart phones and laptops it&#39;s connecting
things and actually this antenna can
connect up to ten thousand devices at
the same time and it can connect these
devices up to a range of 20 kilometers
Wow interesting technology and also the
power consumption needed for these
devices to send
messages over-the-air to this antenna is
very low so they can last on a battery
for very long which is interesting
because if for instance if you want to
connect all the chairs in this room we
don&#39;t have time to charge the chairs
every night like we do with our iPhones
so that&#39;s a good good characteristic
also it&#39;s open technology so anybody can
play such an antenna and any money can
create products that connect to the
antenna so they can access to the
Internet and also the costs are very low
so you can already build a network by
placing one antenna starting from $300
so I was quite excited about this but
but yet again this is just technology
right so so what&#39;s the problem like how
is this technology going to make impact
and I met up with my business partner
Johann and we discussed this new
technology and we thought how can we
make sure that we make impact with this
technology and do something good with it
and if you look at a technology that
really made impact it&#39;s the Internet
right it&#39;s a real infinite so we looked
at how the internet was founded and
actually from the start the internet was
founded by a group of organizations and
they have local computer networks but
they wanted to exchange information so
they connected their networks together
but what they did is they among these
organizations they decided to create a
common language that anybody could use
so these networks and these computers
could respond understand each other
that&#39;s one the second thing they did is
they decided to invest in their end of
the infrastructure so all the cables
that are needed or router boxes that you
need to make the internet work they all
invested in their end of the
infrastructure and the beauty was is
that the internet was founded and it was
owned by everybody and nobody
at the same time and a platform was
created where all kinds of innovations
could flourish and we all know what
happened next but back then we didn&#39;t
know what was next
so we solve this embrace this principle
and let&#39;s apply it to this awesome
technology
so first let&#39;s see if we can create open
language so that all these antennas
could work together as one big network
so imagine a one big mobile operator for
things second why don&#39;t we ask the
future users of this network to invest
in the infrastructure because somebody
has to buy this antenna so we made this
plan we gathered more people little
developers community around us we were
in Amsterdam when we decided that we
want to bonnet to create a city car for
network in Amsterdam in six weeks so
first we needed to create a common
language so called protocol to make
these antennas work together as one big
network a second we needed to find 10
businesses that saw the potential in
this technology and invest all in a
antenna each and we also knew that
coming up with this like technology
story was actually something that
probably businesses wouldn&#39;t not engage
with so what we did is we decided to
create an example and what we did is we
created a water sensor for boats in
Amsterdam and actually Amsterdam if you
go across the canals one in every 10
boats it&#39;s about to sink to the bottom
of the canal so we thought why don&#39;t we
make a sensor for these people they get
notified if their boat fills up with
water so that&#39;s what we what we created
and there you see that there&#39;s actually
a problem that people have in Amsterdam
we have a technology then the data is
actually creating the solutions or
helping them out preventing the boat to
sinking to the bottom of the canals and
then you have value right so that&#39;s what
we did
six weeks later we have ten businesses
across Amsterdam setting up one antenna
each this is the map of Amsterdam and
the circles represents the coverage this
antenna facilitate and we created this
protocol is open language to make all
these antennas work together so we
created a city covering mobile operator
for things we spread that message across
the world and we said like anybody can
do this right so join us copy us do
whatever you like but this is a lot of
fun so what happened next is that people
got inspired by our message and one day
later when we launched this in Amsterdam
we got a message from somebody from
Sydney San Paulo when is there is a
London Paris Cape Town all within a week
and he said we want to do this as well
for our city we want to create a
platform that anybody can create
solutions for IOT upon very easy and
what we did next is this open technology
we used and we created all the tools
surrounded to make networks
we open up that knowledge source code
and as well we did the same for the
solutions and our brand the things
network which we use to launch this we
open up that as well so everybody could
create their own local chapter of what
we did and that world firewall across
the world so what you&#39;re seeing
happening there is that first of all you
saw that his network started this is
just a technology but you saw that with
only ten more gateways you can conquer a
city so the investment is really small
and a lot of people can profit from that
so they can start innovating on this
network without asking anybody
permission without paying any money
money and what happened next is all
kinds of new ideas started coming up so
for instance in Oxford
they have a problem of flooding so
actually every five years there&#39;s a
serious flooding in Oxford in the UK so
citizens decided that they wanted to get
kept to control is more and to get to
know what&#39;s happening so they placed
water level height sensors across the
canals in Oxford and that data was sent
over this antenna network to a central
system that would show the heights of
the canals in Oxford&#39;s generating huge
value because now the city hall can
anticipate on floodings better as well
as the citizens saving tons of money and
trouble another great example citizens
in arms for the Netherlands they were
were curious about the air quality in
their city they were curious about like
what kind of micro climates are there
here so they placed sensors across the
city but of course they want to share
that data across all the citizens of
amis world and they connected these
sensors over this antenna network to a
central system and now they have
information and actually they can make a
stand for air quality in Amersfoort in
Japan when the Fukushima disaster struck
the authorities lacked in providing
sufficient information about hazardous
and non-hazardous our areas they
actually move people from safe areas to
non safe areas so a group of citizens in
Japan decided to take matters in their
own hands and it created a community and
that is placing these sensors and these
sensors are meeting measuring the
radioactivity but then again you need to
gather that data you need a piece of
connectivity so then again they use this
antenna network to real-time sentence
information to a map so
two years now we&#39;re working on this we
now have grown to 30,000 members across
90 countries you can imagine the joy joy
we feel when we see this map is that you
have this crazy idea just open up
technology and it goes viral and and you
see all these different use cases that
really make impact emerge across the
world so we are the proof but if you
open up technology and put it into the
hands of many you will create solutions
that originate from problems and you do
not create solutions that only originate
from business models thank you very much
