so about 30 years ago I was having a
conversation with my father and the only
word that I remember from the
conversation is the word AIDS we were
talking about my favorite uncle uncle
butch who was his brother and the fact
that I can only remember one word from
that conversation and not my own
reaction of grief really says a lot I
wasn&#39;t you know as a seven year old kid
so concerned or wrapped up with the fact
that my favorite uncle my favorite
person in the whole world
was being taken away from me it&#39;s more
afraid of that big word back then a lot
of people were in the same position
folks around the country were in a panic
because some of our most inspirational
artists and some of our most incredible
thinkers and some of our favorite people
being taken away from us for that much
of an explanation and when you look back
at that time it&#39;s no wonder that the
artist will always be known as Prince
described it as the big disease with a
little name and it&#39;s still an incredibly
powerful word it&#39;s about 30 years later
we know a lot more about HIV which is
the virus that causes AIDS and about
AIDS we know how its transmitted I think
most people here would be able to tell
you that it&#39;s primarily transmitted
through unprotected sex and shared
needles during drug use but not only
does everybody nowadays know how the
virus is transmitted the science has
gotten better the medications have
gotten better so much so to the point
that people who are hiv-positive can
lead healthy lives almost as long lives
as people who are HIV negative and there
has been a growing movement and part of
my work is the phosphorus movement of
community partners and public health
officials that understand that it is
possible for us to end AIDS as an
epidemic even without a cure and so let
me explain that for
minute when you&#39;re hiv-positive you have
a number of HIV copies and your and your
body if you&#39;re taking medicine you&#39;re
stabilized it&#39;s possible and very likely
because the medicine is so powerful
nowadays that you will become
undetectable that is if you take an HIV
test you might even come up negative the
Center for Disease Control just recently
said that if you&#39;re undetectable if you
reach that status then the virus is
untranslatable so even without a cure
it&#39;s possible to end AIDS as an epidemic
not just in the United States but around
the world so 30 years after that
conversation that I have with my father
I serve as vice president for community
mobilization and I worked at an
organization called Housing Works and
judging from that response some people
may know that Housing Works is founded
by members has ACT UP people who
aggressively fought back against
government in action at the onslaught of
the AIDS epidemic and if you were
listening to that story that I told
about my uncle you might think that
that&#39;s my primary or sole motivation for
getting involved in this work but I&#39;m a
community organizer that&#39;s how I got
into the field and community organizers
find inspiration everywhere and
sometimes and unexpected situations so
recently I&#39;ll take you to one I was in a
hospital room wearing roughly the same
guard as the last time that I saw my
uncle so wearing a face mask and a hair
net and a doctor handed me my child for
the very first time and I held that
child and I looked that child in the
face and the first thought that came to
my mind was I hope you bury me maybe I
was thinking a little bit about the
tragedy that my grandmother had to go
through she actually buried two of her
children
or maybe I was just being a father and
being overprotective anyway as I said
earlier I have a lot of conversations
with people about hiv/aids not just
professionally but also at parties and I
kind of have to whenever somebody says
what do you do I can&#39;t really run away
from that but the fun thing is is that I
wind up having a lot of conversations
with complete strangers about sex and
drugs and it&#39;s great icebreaker I get to
know people pretty quickly so those
conversations though a lot of times will
take different turns depending on what
subject matter comes up next if this
person decides that they that they feel
confident enough to start talking a
little bit more lingo they might bring
up perinatal infections and for people
who are unfamiliar with that that means
that someone is just born hiv-positive
there&#39;s mother-to-child transmission now
there&#39;s really not a lot of room for
joking or for loose talk around there
when you&#39;re talking about someone who&#39;s
just born hiv-positive the other thing
that tends to happen is any stigma or
blame that&#39;s associated with how that
person became HIV positive goes away
because all this baby did was be born in
a community with less access to
healthcare because perinatal infections
are totally preventable provided that
you have routine health care and you
have quality health care and from these
conversations I&#39;ve kind of figured out
that people delineate between people who
are HIV positive that did something to
deserve their status and people who just
had the misfortune of being in the wrong
place the wrong time
or living in a community without access
to health care the data though tells us
something much much different so if you
were to look at data now and look at a
group or population of people that are
have high rates of unprotected sex you
might think that group is going to
become HIV positive as a higher rate
it&#39;s not the case
and one of the other really really
important pieces of data that I like to
carry around in my hip pocket is are the
results from a systematic review of
about a hundred and fifty studies since
1996 where they looked at health
outcomes for people living with HIV and
this systematic review found that the
number one predictor for health outcomes
for people living with HIV was housing
status so that means that people who
were most disproportionately impacted by
poverty and by homelessness today are
disproportionately impacted by HIV now
let&#39;s go back to the party so no that
might have been a little bit depressing
and heavy sometimes we&#39;re at the party
person who I&#39;ve just started talking
about sex and drugs with might say
something like you work in AIDS
I thought AIDS is over and it is true
there are a lot of well it&#39;s true that
we don&#39;t talk about hiv/aids as much in
the United States as we used to although
I would like to point out over the last
20 years the number of new infections
has not gone down its hovered around the
same number about 40,000 and also when
you consider the number of people living
in the United States who are AIDS deaths
about 700,000 is on par with the total
number of US combat deaths since the
United States was founded that&#39;s a lot
we don&#39;t tend to think about that very
much 700,000 over the course of a
35-year epidemic worldwide were talking
about 39 million people what if I were
to tell you that last year there were 1
million AIDS deaths
and I sadly knew more than my fair share
of those 1 million last year and I&#39;ll
tell you right now there were no less
brilliant no less important they were at
least somebody&#39;s favorite person but the
face the epidemic has changed hasn&#39;t
changed as the numbers we still have an
epidemic on our hands
what has changed as a face of HIV a face
of AIDS looks a lot more like mine a lot
darker somehow more easily criminalized
somehow less sympathetic somehow some
might even say less than so I&#39;ve been
black my entire life
but I won&#39;t tell you everything that
I&#39;ve been through I&#39;ll just take you
back a couple years ago I had a vacation
plan in August 2014 and somehow found
myself in Ferguson Missouri friends of
mine were registering people to vote in
Ferguson because they felt like getting
community members engaged in local
government was the solution to a lot of
the problems I happily signed up less
than 24 hours after I landed standing
there with a clipboard about six of my
friends were registering people bloke
vote were all black and we suddenly find
ourselves on the wrong end of a weapon
being held by a law enforcement official
actually two one was holding in the air
and the other one was pointing at us and
the person on my left said something
I&#39;ll never forget
which kind of cut the tension she said
it&#39;s too early in the day for somebody
to point a gun at me it&#39;s about three
o&#39;clock in the afternoon
the amazing thing when I go back to that
moment is that we got out without much
of a hassle this is a but most people
would think oh you had a gun pointed at
you how did you get out of it you must
have thought of something really really
intelligent to say we just followed the
drill I&#39;m sad to say but I sometimes
understand that my life&#39;s may be looked
at as disposable just a few hours before
that I was at the death site of Michael
Brown who was a young man who was shot
to death in Ferguson Missouri in August
2014 the amazing thing about the death
site is that you could not distinguish
bloodstains on the asphalt from candle
wax that had melted from candles that
were burned in his memory one false step
that&#39;s me I just proposed to my wife
it&#39;s now my wife
less than 24 hours before would have
never seen her again that is far too
common and I want to point out right now
that Michael Brown was shot to death
exactly one year before I held that baby
in my arms
one really really important thing that I
want everyone to walk out of here with
is the knowledge and understanding that
you can affect change and seemingly
insurmountable opposition at friend
named James who in many ways was the
face of the AIDS epidemic it was black
man who was incarcerated for nonviolent
drug offense and when he got out he had
trouble finding housing because nobody
wants the house and he couldn&#39;t find
work because nobody wants a felon
working for them he&#39;s HIV positive
James buried four of his children they
are all AIDS deaths his last child&#39;s
deathbed he said to her I&#39;m going to do
something I&#39;m gonna do something and
that James shortly after I moved to New
York to run a campaign to help end a
discriminatory policy that kept people
living with HIV and AIDS cycling in and
out of homelessness putting their lives
at risk there are about 10,000 people
who were constantly teetering on the
brink of homelessness and possibly of
that because they would be then
disconnected from health care services
and James was one of them and that&#39;s how
I met him James would not stop he was in
deep achieveable he just would not give
up because his life depended on it
and no matter how discouraged we got I
remember one meeting or really on the
campaign that I have with our bill
sponsors chief of staff and this person
says to me I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re
working on it this is impossible
after that James started singing The
Impossible Dream from Lant from a NOLA
mantra at every rally and I remember
hold all of us holding hands tears
streaming down her face because that
campaign seemed impossible but we had no
other choice and we buried a lot of
friends on the way but we want
the way we get to the end of AIDS is by
replicating that work not stopping
standing up for against injustice it&#39;s
about a year ago August to be to be
exact I was on the road a lot we were
meeting with presidential campaigns to
talk to them about joining and
bolstering this movement of folks who
are working to end AIDS as a coalition
they&#39;re about 13 different jurisdictions
scattered throughout the United States
that are working towards that New York
State is one of them and we&#39;re actually
we&#39;re actually looking pretty good
and I was on my way back from Texas when
I heard that James was sick in the
hospital so as soon as I landed I went
and looked for James I got there a few
hours later than then his life span and
I had it all planned out
I knew James was dying my friend of
seven years my first friends in New York
City I knew what I was going to say to
him that not only did you do something
look at what you started people are
replicating the work that we did around
the nation and now around the world we
did it but I didn&#39;t get the talk to him
I can&#39;t talk to James but I can talk to
you I&#39;m going to ask you right now to
make a commitment that tomorrow you&#39;re
gonna call your Assemblymember or your
senator or both preferably and demand
that they fully fund New York State&#39;s
plan to end AIDS as an epidemic the next
thing that I want you to do is call your
Congress member and ensure that any
changes to our health care system result
in more people covered not fewer less
out-of-pocket expenses not more and
coverage that is the quality of what
members of Congress received
[Applause]
we&#39;re almost there
BRR almost there and ending an epidemic
that has claimed the lives of 39 million
and dramatically altered the lives of 78
million people one of the worst
catastrophes in the history of human
existence and to do it without a cure so
we can&#39;t get there unless people take up
the battle flag for people like James
and other people that fell before them
and keep marching on that journey to the
end of AIDS thank you
[Applause]
