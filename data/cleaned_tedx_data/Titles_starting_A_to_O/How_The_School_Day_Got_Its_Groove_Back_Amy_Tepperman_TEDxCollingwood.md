let&#39;s try this together so I invite you
to roll your shoulders back sit up nice
and tall and join me in a snap oh that
feels good
okay keep snapping but every time you
snap I want you to choose a different
way or a different place to snap there
we go
different every time can be one hand the
other hand yes okay now show me all that
style and personality that you got yes
and it would snap with the person beside
you other side of you maybe someone
across the audience that you don&#39;t even
know full awkward&#39;s add back to me and
relax now I know you felt it too because
your faces went from - to think back to
your grade school classroom grade 3
grade 6 what did it look like
better question what did it feel like
for some people maybe like that what if
teachers could create that feeling in
math in literacy in science I used to
teach in a different kind of classroom
my first career was actually in digital
animation making children&#39;s cartoons and
I taught animation for a number of years
in the college sector where I made an
observation that grinded my gears a
little bit so in a three-hour class
sitting behind a computer screen the
entire time we would take a 15 minute
break in the middle and in my early
years of teaching in this break people
would get up they&#39;d walk around they&#39;d
get
some fresh air outside those who stayed
in the room actually talk to each other
this is where they&#39;d share ideas
collaborate ask for help and very
quickly as technology seemed to dominate
our lives the energy of this break
completely changed we&#39;re now in the only
opportunity in three hours to move away
from your screen
nobody did everyone just stay on the
internet or on their phones people stop
talking to each other as if they were
all strangers rather than at the
beginnings of one of the most creative
imaginative careers in the world and I
remember thinking it was like I was
seeing this humaneness being learned out
of us but I put it out of my mind I
didn&#39;t really think about it too much
back then and I ended up leaving that
career and returning to my original
childhood passion dancing and I was
given this opportunity to facilitate
dance party like workshops with
thousands of students and teachers in
public elementary and high schools and
looking back little did I know that what
I was gonna learn from those dance party
workshops might actually lead me to
proactively bringing the humaneness back
to that 15 minute break so today I&#39;m
gonna talk to you about education and
I&#39;m gonna show you how using a dance
party as a teaching tool in multiple
subjects throughout the school day can
create richer healthier more engaging
learning environments and therefore
human beings what creates a rich
engaging healthy environment let&#39;s
unpack the snap we began with what did
we do first we started with something
physical we engaged the body we did this
all together as a group creating this
sense of unity next we added in the
brain the cognitive we start to make
some different decisions we were
creative with it next we added in the
being the social-emotional we began to
interact with each
and I got to see your style and your
personality which also gave us this
sense of individuality at the same time
so what we have going on is this equal
engagement of the entire self and a
community where both unity and
individuality are both present and
celebrated and I especially love this
second one because if you think about it
these two truths about human beings are
very rarely celebrated together they&#39;re
usually separate it&#39;s usually we are all
united or everybody&#39;s got to be
different and the truth is we are both
and look at the positivity we create in
the room when we celebrate both at the
same time this was inspired by a woman
named misty Tripoli and misty at the top
of her game in the LA fitness industry
had a realization that her true health
and true happiness came from finding her
groove and dancing and not dancing for
choreography but the kind of dancing you
do when nobody&#39;s watching kind of
dancing and she created this approach
she calls the groove method to
facilitate group dance experiences that
give people that same feeling this
connection to self connection to others
a group of us in Ontario wanted to see
if we could make this work with kids and
we had an audience in public elementary
in high schools to practice on and after
quite a bit of trial and error we
started to get pretty good at it and I
became extremely inspired and blown away
by the results that we were seeing from
these kids so have a look at the level
of engagement and those two ideas being
put into practice
I know right
so it was clear this was powerful
dancing not for choreography not for
technique but for expression and
community and connection so essentially
a dance party where we have this equal
engagement of the whole self and a
community were both unity and
individuality were present and
celebrated was creating a rich healthy
engaging environment seeing as we were
doing this in the gym being active and
working inside a very compartmentalized
siloed education sector the natural
response from teachers administrators
and us was that this was something great
for physical education and dance
curriculum which is part of the arts so
we began to create resources for
teachers teaching those subjects to use
this as a more holistic tool in their
teaching that was until a math
consultant was in one of our sessions
for teachers and she pulls me aside
after and she says you know there are a
lot of numeracy connections naturally
occurring and what you&#39;re doing
problem-solving spatial reasoning you
should consider identifying the math
connections present in your dance and
phys ed material make it more cross
curricular I was intrigued I go home I
download the math curriculum and to my
surprise I totally geek out I mean I am
up late at night reading this thing like
it is 50 shades of math I cannot put it
down and having grown up as a dancer and
then spending so much time in digital
animation creating movement in a 3d
space with grids and graphs and numbers
all of these ideas start flooding into
my mind about how we can practice
fractions as if for break dancers and
angles as if we&#39;re inside a pacman game
and geometric properties as if for
martial artists and I had a thought I
didn&#39;t want to identify the math
connections present in our dance and
phys-ed material
but what if we took this approach that
was working in the gym and gave it to
classroom teachers to apply to the math
curriculum itself and now instead of
students learning sitting down paper and
pencil we use our entire self to learn
before we explore this further let&#39;s
have a look at why this is so important
guidelines dictate how long teachers are
to spend on each subject now this varies
from province to province and a little
bit between school boards and sometimes
schools but in general the 1500 minute
week of school so 300 minutes of
instruction time a day looks something
like this
let&#39;s see what happens if we break this
down into the categories of the body the
brain and the being our academics give
us a nice sized brain we do have
physical education we&#39;ve got the body in
there so the brain and the body they&#39;re
they&#39;re rather obvious what is less
obvious is the being the
social-emotional and we do have the arts
left which one would argue and I would
agree are great tools for social
emotional learning but in general these
subjects can be much more random and
inconsistent in how they&#39;re taught and
generally not seen as dedicated
social-emotional learning time so this
picture at best maybe looks like this
clearly we have a very imbalanced day as
far as the entire self and the community
is concerned and I think we can all
agree that now more than ever
students need more opportunities to be
active creative and interactive and so
do you I invite you to please stand up
okay now this one&#39;s gonna be a little
less dance party party because we want
to be mindful of the tight space that we
have so it&#39;s gonna be a little calmer
listen to your body if you do feel like
doing this sitting down you can
definitely do this sitting down as well
okay relax your body a little bit this
is an activity I call Tai geometry and
we are going to explore geometric
properties and no way am i claiming this
to be authentic Tai Chi although we are
going to adopt some of its principles
okay first what I would like you to do
is mold in front of you with your hands
a square faced pyramid there we go now
don&#39;t look at me look at the pyramid
don&#39;t look at me
visualize it perfect visualize what
color it is what size it is now show me
your hands
connect one of your fingers to your
thumb whichever is most comfortable bend
your knees a little bit and visualizing
where all the edges and vertices of this
pyramid are draw them with your hands
slowly mindfully allowing your
creativity to guide your movement yes
okay my friends we&#39;ve got some funky
beats in the background so you are
welcome to add a little style to this
yeah there we go there we go now notice
we are all united doing the same task
but we&#39;re all doing it differently still
unity and individuality okay put your
palm under the base put your finger at
the vertex at the top now visualize it
as you rotate it 90 degrees maintain its
size
don&#39;t let it grow or shrink don&#39;t look
at me look the pyramid okay now the
vertices and edges have moved in their
new position draw them again
the looks of concentration on your faces
are amazing visualization and spatial
and spatial reasoning very very
important for most STEM careers again
you can show me a little style with this
we got the music playing there we go
don&#39;t look at me look at the pyramid
alright and relax your arms turn to face
a partner preferably somebody you don&#39;t
know
turn to face a partner ha ha acknowledge
your partner somehow ok partner a has
longer hair partner B has shorter hair
ok we figured it out ok partner a in
that same style draw a sphere in front
of you any size you on partner a draw
that sphere yes again you can add a
little style we got some beats happen in
the background ok partner a don&#39;t stop
keep drawing partner B draw a sphere
that is double the size of partner A&#39;s
this looks pretty cool double the size
and relax your arms acknowledge your
partner somehow acknowledge somebody
across the room somehow there we go and
have a seat have a seat have a seat
nicely done so you just explored from
the geometry and spatial sense strand of
the Ontario math curriculum geometric
properties vertices edges identifying
those geometric relationships we had
some location and movement in there with
some rotate with rotations and some
angles as well nicely done now for me
the mission was really clear this is
something great for physical education
and dance curriculum and it still
belongs there but if we stop there we&#39;re
really not changing this picture so
first we applied it to math next we
applied it to literacy and we&#39;re
continuing to make our way across the
other subjects to eventually effectively
integrate the entire school day and we
now have hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of teachers that are stepping
outside their own comfort zones and
using this approach and using these
resources as a tool in their classroom
throughout the day and it is amazing to
hear some of their stories we hear about
students who generally show higher
behavior needs showing better
self-regulation students who generally
make excuses to leave during class
especially math class staying and
participating students that are usually
a little bit more shy and don&#39;t
generally answer questions participating
showing more confidence showing a growth
mindset this being a wonderful
differentiated instruction tool for all
students although we have a group of
teachers that work with students that
are visually impaired that use this as
an alternative approach in their classes
as well and they&#39;re being creative
interactive and getting up and moving
throughout the day and we know that
getting up and moving has great benefits
to our physical self but also in our
cognitive and our readiness to learn and
all of this for the social-emotional
well one of my favorite stories that I
heard though came from right here in
Simcoe County one of the board
consultants in in this board was
demonstrating that exact accept activity
tie geometry to a group of teachers and
one of the teachers came to her after
and said that she has a condition that
makes it difficult for her to create
mental images in her mind but during
that activity she could and I asked our
contact who was the teacher and she
couldn&#39;t remember so Simcoe teacher if
you&#39;re in this audience or if you&#39;re
watching this please can you get in
touch with me because I have a couple
questions that I wanna ask you about
that schools are a place to learn but
maybe they&#39;re also a great place to
unlearn and to relearn what it is that
makes us human when we were all snapping
in the beginning practicing geometry a
little later on we were reminded that
our brains are not separate from our
bodies and our beings our communities
are a combination of unity and
individuality and when we put it all
together
this audience came to life so what if
teachers involve students in learning
using these ideas in multiple subjects
throughout the school day we have a
captive audience of future generations
for 1500 minutes a week and we can all
agree the system needs to evolve to be
more integrated and ministries are
definitely taking steps in the right
direction but in large systems changes
take time and regardless of mandate it
is the teachers that make the difference
it is the teachers that are the change
makers on the front lines and our
communities are equipped with thousands
of them well positioned to create richer
healthier more engaging learning
environments and lives for today&#39;s tiny
humans they need the support and they
need new tools and what better tool can
you think of than a dance party
