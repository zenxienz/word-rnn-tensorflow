hello Melvin convention center
hey guys doing we&#39;re we&#39;re open ocean
we&#39;re kind of very very happy to be here
and yeah I mean we were local guys and
enough of my rights is Kiwi though we
met here and would live here and I&#39;m
French so I don&#39;t know we&#39;re still local
though there is the rebellious aspect of
what we&#39;re doing today it&#39;s kind of
rebelling against what music should be
you know and we&#39;ve taken flamenco
guitars and kind of taken it to the rock
side of things so hope you enjoy those
tunes and yeah yeah thank you so much
you guys are in for a awesome day today
we&#39;re here to kind of pump you up so I
hope we&#39;re doing a little bit of that
we&#39;re gonna do one more song but I
should mention these two songs that
we&#39;re doing are songs which were
releasing later in the year so these are
new songs in a sense one of them&#39;s a
little old but we&#39;re pretty excited to
get those out there and we&#39;re actually
doing a Kickstarter later this week so
you guys can follow us on social media
just type in the open ocean and we&#39;ve
got a whole bunch of content and a whole
bunch of cool things really easy to find
yeah that&#39;s it but like Alex said we
like to have a little bit of the
acoustic almost Spanish guitar which we
were inspired by Rodrigo Gabriela and we
like to fuse it with a whole bunch of
new styles so it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a new
revolution which is going on in the
music industry where we&#39;re going to
old-school things and bringing in new
technology so we&#39;re giving you a bit of
there today
hope you enjoy the sounds and thank you
so much for being here guys
