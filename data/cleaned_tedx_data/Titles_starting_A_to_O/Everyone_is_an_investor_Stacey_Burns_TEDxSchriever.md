how many of you have socks
so not everybody has money how do you
have ever bought a house how many
commercials
very very excited when I found this info
because I realized at least one other
person in the world increases every time
you spend money you&#39;re casting a vote
everyone is an investor and whether
you&#39;re eight or eighty where you spend
your money tells us from these to keep
doing what they&#39;re doing
you&#39;re telling me company that
manufactures its products in China to
keep giving more you&#39;re telling the
store that payments employs orally to
keep very much we&#39;re maybe you&#39;re
telling the grocer the by has produce
with no pesticides to ignite and you&#39;re
telling the story that sold you the
t-shirt that fed a family for a week to
keep doing that every purchase you made
is an investment and therefore everyone
is an investor and what if we can
measure those
the same way we measure our 401k and
whatever we could value align our values
with our everyday purchases and what is
called social return the definition of
social return on investment is here but
very simply put it&#39;s what happens when
you take a solid business model combine
it with heart passion purpose mission
whatever you want to call it and you end
up making your community your country
your world better what if your mortgage
broker donated money to a local student
shop that suits men and me for free what
if your realty company was owned by for
nonprofits that are doing good in your
community what if you bought a backpack
the funds anti-bullying programs in high
school and what if you bought a burrito
that gave someone in java school that
was part of the food service tree
every purchase unique is an investment
and what if I told you these companies
are in your backyard and what if I told
you that they save you money state your
community money it&#39;s just by existing
everyone is a professor so I am NOT a
numbers person I hated statistics I
almost failed it twice but numbers are
important they are common ground across
cultures they expressed value and they
give us some points of comparison I
think sometimes we get caught up and the
numbers of compare apples to apples and
sometimes
orgeous around people and see how some
of these companies that are doing good
fair enough in stock market and some of
the characteristics that they look for
these are examples of some of the
companies some of the characteristics
that they look or that they found in
these companies were firms of endearment
is that they are paying employees a
higher range and a better benefit
package than others and there
they&#39;re hiring people that are
passionate about customer service
they&#39;re treating them society as
partners and productivity and quality
and they value their corporate culture
custom of their greatest assets so in
DeBary these companies please drink the
Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 which is the top
500 performing stocks picked up Jim
Collins been to great companies but
we&#39;re evaluating for their culture and
then the international community after
three years nothing to earth-shattering
the standard reporters returned about a
57% return the good to great cup weeks
for 222 percent that&#39;s why the great
great and your friends in German
returned to 83 percent so better than
the average stock market but it&#39;s not as
good as those great companies and then
we look at five years and then we leave
in 10 years and then we get to 15 years
16 hundred and eighty one percent return
for movies that shows doing good not
over the bottom line but in addition an
investor and whether you chose to buy
shares in these stocks on stock market
where you supported them directly by
buying their products and services you
benefited in the long run Eric Ries the
author at lean startups is working on a
long-term stock exchange and with a
long-term stock exchange like he wants
is for companies to be able to focus on
not just quarterly earnings
but 15 years from now and what that
could look like and what the potential
of good that business can do for all of
your pocketbooks but also for your
community and your environment so when
you&#39;re looking to invest
specifically in a 401k you have these
options you have high risk profiles to
have low risk profiles and everything in
between you have the option for donor
advised funds you can even do social
impact investing profiles but how do you
know companies that&#39;s where social
investment comes in being able to
measure the impact that these companies
are having and be able to tell their
story is how people know so for social
return on investment we my colleagues
might develop something great somewhat
sadistic profiles that we call them in
tactical class there were three young
women three calgary&#39;s the established
social return on investment is
considered certain or most likely to
have a social return on investment your
probable as I write is considered very
likely to have a return and you&#39;re
comfortable has ROI is it&#39;s likely to
have a return that maybe the diamond is
quite
so let&#39;s look at an example let&#39;s say
you have some money to invest and
there&#39;s two companies that are an option
the first company wants to give up 500
families that&#39;s a lot right 500 of the
lot of people would help that&#39;s very
visible it&#39;s something that you know and
then you have an option for a company
that&#39;s going to serve by people for one
year and intensive healthier so probably
a little more expensive available
maybe it&#39;s awesome prevention effects
maybe it&#39;s got some intervention effects
but at the end of that year those people
madly let&#39;s delve into the sry profiles
a little bit so for the 500 for the
establishments our life you&#39;ve got its
immediate its visible it&#39;s a large
quantity demanded of your probable as
our life is you probably have some
tremendous
probably and your possible hazards this
one and then liquefied
so you&#39;re established sry what if you
intervened in the early stages of a
disease what if you caught someone in
the early stages of diabetes when you
caught someone and their early stages of
cancer
how the hell some cost savings
associated with that probably a quality
of life difference to the treatment of
that you have how did you prevent maybe
just by keeping my person healthcare
three years they were able to stay in
school or they kept a job and then we
get to possible as our life and maybe by
staying in school or getting that job
they provided more stability for their
family over a longer period of time and
maybe for those kids and their home that
watch them go to work or to school every
day and be successful
maybe which is to be more successful at
work so every investor is about lying
with a different value in each of these
scenarios
it shows the battery is Alice Adams and
it&#39;s good to know it&#39;s apples to oranges
and the measurement of that impact and
being able to look at those impact
profiles can help you make buying
decisions so as all right it&#39;s not just
for consumers if you as a consumer can
align your values with how your domain
purchases baseline impact profiles and
social return on investment
don&#39;t the businesses need to be able to
tell you that story when employees of
that company feel like they&#39;re larger
they&#39;re part of something larger than
just a paycheck when they work for these
companies it doesn&#39;t the business want
to feel try to try and be able to share
with you what their impacted so my
colleagues and I are working on a free
calculator where businesses can come in
and put it down and get the basic as
already number back the challenge is
creating this calculator is a lack of
data over time social impact businesses
are still fairly new and we figure out
how to track it but I hope that some
made every business can measure what and
how they&#39;re impacting their community
with social return on investment and I
hope that every investor which is Jules
I&#39;ll show the world what you have
you
