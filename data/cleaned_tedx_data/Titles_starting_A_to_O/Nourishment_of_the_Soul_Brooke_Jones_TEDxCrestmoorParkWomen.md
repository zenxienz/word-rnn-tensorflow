so mine apart of a personal story and
for me it starts in childhood if any of
you watch stranger things right now so
I&#39;m a child of the 70s and 80s and I
used to play a lot outside with the
neighborhood kids we&#39;d play kick-the-can
and goes to the graveyard and
hide-and-seek can we just stay out there
and tell her parents were screaming at
us to come inside usually pretty late at
night well into the darkness but for me
the darkness at night was safety at
least outside it was it was friends it
was fun it was a lot of screaming and
yelling and throwing stuff around
outside kids being kids but when I went
inside to my house the darkness was not
a place of safety at night in my room
usually in the middle of the night the
darkness would be interrupted by the
silhouette of my dad smoking a cigarette
and I could just see the Ember of the
end of that cigarette in the doorway and
it would be petrified because I knew
what was coming next my dad was an
alcoholic he was a drug addict he had
mental illness and he was abusive when I
was nine years old in the middle of the
night in that darkness my father shot
and killed himself in the bedroom next
to mine in the days that followed his
death there were endless streams of
people that came through our house
bringing cards flowers teddy bears
endless Honey Baked hams a lot of him
actually don&#39;t like him to this day
I really don&#39;t but I watched this
endless stream of people coming in and I
was sort of outside of myself I would be
numb watching this and I was trying so
hard to feel the sadness that people
felt
I was nine and you know kids have a hard
time with emotion and really the only
thing I felt was a sense of relief that
that fear was gone and that I might be
able to sleep and be in the house safely
in the darkness for the first time in my
life the night before I was supposed to
go back to school which was probably a
week after he died I was petrified again
because I was nervous about how the kids
were gonna treat me when I got back to
school kids are strange right things
happen trauma happens weird things
happen and kids turn on you because they
don&#39;t really know how to handle emotion
they don&#39;t know how to handle kids that
have been damaged and at that point I
felt like a secret of mine had been let
out of the bag and that these kids were
gonna treat me differently because they
didn&#39;t know what else to do so I was
scared but what I didn&#39;t expect is what
I actually happened the next day when I
went back to school it was as if the
entire school had been prepared for my
return my brother&#39;s return the kids were
so warm and welcoming they brought me
right back into the fold with him played
like nothing had changed the teachers
were there early to prep me and make
sure I was doing okay made sure I could
get caught up with my homework anything
I needed and they had given me actually
this huge card the whole class the whole
grade had signed these woods of sympathy
and kindness love and I still have that
card to this day and that was the first
moment where I realized this seemingly
small act of kindness where these kids
had brought me back into the fold and
these adults have really prepped for in
my mind this broken child to come back
to school and I think that was the first
time an act of kindness changed my life
and actually probably saved my life if I
fast forward a little bit to adulthood
when I was 31 years old I got pregnant
loved being pregnant I actually had a
fabulous pregnancy
every part of it and I was so looking
forward to meeting this daughter that
was I knew this coming but the moment
she was born everything changed and I
was plunged into a very deep dark
painful postpartum depression that had
me planning my own suicide and I was
very lucky that I had a loving and
caring and supportive husband
parents and friends who immediately saw
what was going on with me and they were
able to get me support and help right
away
and at that point I started a long
journey of mental illness and medication
of my own and I spent the next 10 years
on many many different medications for
anxiety depression paranoia sleep you
name it I was on it or I&#39;d tried it and
at one point there for a pretty long
stretch of period of time I had seven
different medications that I was on two
of them just to counteract the effects
of the others that I was taking but I
wasn&#39;t ashamed of it and I wasn&#39;t I
wouldn&#39;t say I was ashamed of being
mentally ill I was ashamed of taking
medication the medication saved my life
but more importantly those that
supported me and never ever judged me in
those moments of postpartum depression
that was the second act of kindness that
literally saved my life about six years
ago I took a job as the vice president
of the random acts of kindness
foundation there actually is a job that
pays me to make the world a better place
it&#39;s pretty sweet job but it&#39;s actually
also been one of the most difficult and
painful journeys in my life because
kindness for me means so much
it is these moments that seemingly
little small acts of kindness that to
the person who&#39;s witnessing them or the
person who&#39;s giving them and sometimes
to the person that&#39;s receiving them they
don&#39;t seem like a big deal but in fact
they can change your life and possibly
save your life and I wanted to be able
to share that with the rest rest of the
world I wanted people to know the
in fact kindness can have on you and so
then there&#39;s six years I&#39;ve traveled the
world I have worked with amazing people
some of whom are here and I spent
actually a good amount of time talking
to the Dalai Lama about kindness and the
impact that it has so I understand that
from a personal level I understand it
from the global level and I wanted to
make sure other people understood it as
well I had a conversation with one of my
colleagues about two years ago who knew
how much I was struggling with the
mental illness and all the medications
and this idea that I would probably
never get off of them my norm was that
the rest of my life I would be on
medication just like somebody who has to
take medication for diabetes for the
rest of their life it was just the way
it was going to be for me but I wanted
to get past this sort of neutral place
that on my best day I felt neutral I
wanted to feel like one of those happy
people that could enjoy every day or
look forward to something every day I
just wanted to get up and not have a
really bad day that was my goal and she
asked me how I was doing with the
medication and I had to think about it
for a minute cuz I hadn&#39;t thought about
it&#39;s not something I think about all the
time and I said it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve
been off of six of the seven medications
now for over a year and I didn&#39;t even
realize it and she said why do you think
that is and they said well I think this
stuff we&#39;re talking about really works
and I don&#39;t think I realized that I can
go out and talk about the impact of
kindness and the signs of kindness but
it never really felt like it was part of
my healing process and so I had a
revelation that in fact was so I want to
talk a little bit about that in a minute
but I&#39;m gonna ask you to indulge me for
a second and this might be a little
uncomfortable for you but I&#39;m gonna ask
you to do it anyway and ask you when I
said go to stand up and turn the person
next to you and hug them for ten seconds
and I&#39;m gonna count you down
and then I&#39;ll explain why afterwards
okay
ready go
[Applause]
okay ten seconds
this is a great viewpoint up here
because I can see both people who loved
that and people who were super
uncomfortable with that but what I can
also see is a lot of people if not
everybody in this room is smiling and
some of that may be because of
discomfort what really that was probably
because it felt good and there is a
biological reason for that and this is
where I started to getting to this idea
of why is kindness so important and why
is it so impossible and so right there
what we just did was an act of kindness
for each other for yourselves and for me
to witness so there is this
triangulation of kindness the person
who&#39;s receiving it the person who&#39;s
giving it and the person who witnesses
all have the exact same reaction in
their body and in their brain and the
same levels of dopamine serotonin
endorphins all these things we&#39;ve been
hearing about you all have the same
reaction it&#39;s interesting with kindness
there are people who are perpetually
kind I&#39;m actually not one of them even
though you might think I would be I&#39;m
not I&#39;m not perpetually good but those
that are perpetually kind have 23
percent less cortisol in their body
which is your stress hormone so without
going into all the statistics about this
when you have higher levels of
endorphins dopamine serotonin oxytocin
lower levels of cortisol you actually
have lower blood pressure you feel more
connected to the people around you you
have lower stress you sleep better live
longer you look younger
I&#39;m kind of hoping Big Pharma is not
watching this right now sort of the
Fountain of Youth that we&#39;re talking
about right now and it&#39;s pretty easy
because really only a couple minutes a
day you can get this if you are doing
this on a regular basis you can get the
effects of this all the time that hug is
one little bit imagine if you felt like
that all the time from just buying
coffee for somebody you&#39;re letting them
merge into traffic that was a hard one I
know so what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re
actually continuing to do acts of
kindness is you&#39;re sort of filling your
unknown emotional bank account and when
you are able to do that and put these
things into this emotional bank account
or when somebody&#39;s doing something kind
for you you&#39;ve got this overflowing
emotional bank account so that when
trauma comes or crisis or just really
bad days you can pull out of that
emotional bank account and you&#39;re not
overdrawn if that makes sense and we&#39;ve
all been there where we&#39;re really
feeling overdrawn so keep doing that so
based on my background statistics would
tell you that I should not be here
tonight I should probably be addicted to
alcohol or drugs I should probably be
unemployed
I should be obese I should be
emotionally unhealthy I definitely
should not be successful I should not be
standing up here talking to a crowd of
people about kindness but I am here
and what my challenge to all of you
tonight is to do something really simple
and that&#39;s tuned in to the beauty around
you recognize acts of kindness that you
see that you hear that you feel that you
experience participate in them that&#39;s
pretty easy it can be letting that guy
merge in front of traffic if you can be
buying a cup of coffee for somebody it
can be writing a letter of gratitude to
somebody who&#39;s made a difference in your
life and sending it to them better yet
you could deliver it in person and read
it to them you could hug somebody for 10
seconds and you can do more of that and
it&#39;s really easy you doesn&#39;t have to
cost you a thing so I would ask you to
go a little bit outside of your comfort
zone and start doing this and you&#39;ll
begin to heal not only yourself but
those around you and when we start to do
that you can really change the world and
it starts now
