some of you out there have dogs right
I&#39;m not a family member scared of them
aka my mom sorry mom
when people think of those adorable
furry creatures they think of them
running around playing or cuddling with
its owner but has anyone ever stopped
and thought about all those dogs in that
lonely shelter without anyone to play
with this leap through lonely cold
nights and our trapped in cages all
summer long they give them blind food
and very little entertainment or
exercise it&#39;s absolutely heartbreaking
to think of those miserable puppies
desperate to live a happy life really no
one wants to see sad dogs right so I
want to make a difference I want to
change the way dog shelters provide for
dogs and treat dogs completely I don&#39;t
tempura-fried comfortable dog beds so
the dogs can sleep peacefully and
happily I know it&#39;s gonna be a little
costly but many beanbag chairs would be
just as comfortable so I visited a
shelter a few days back as part of my
research and I saw that the dogs are
really sad and there are native toys so
dog shelters need to add toys for dogs I
know that&#39;s also gonna be costly but how
do I help shelters add toys for
abandoned pets you ask well it&#39;s going
to take the help of everybody at my
school I will create I plan on creating
a club called animal lovers we will
create simple and cheap toys for dogs
and we will collect products and items
for not just only dogs but for every
other animal in the shelter like cats
guinea pigs hamsters and more but what
if my principle does not agree what do I
do
well my principle has always told us to
feel free to put up posters school
appropriate
well I will create five posters and
under every poster it would say please
donate here there would be a cardboard
box which which would says donate here
and each and every box would go to a
different shelter who hates being birdy
well shelters have must have a clean
environment a clean environment attracts
more people to the shelter
and more people which means more dogs
would be adopted and now grooming is
very essential to a dog&#39;s health since
it keeps them with freshly cut nails and
hair now overall dog shelters need to
take better care for their dogs and give
them all the love they need till their
new best friend comes along and gives
them a brand new home not just any roof
over their head but where their hearts
belong thank you
