Oh
[Applause]
good morning it&#39;s Carl I&#39;m the
co-founder of this game so I want to
take you back to the 6th of February
there was a very special tea and then it
should Singapore because something very
significant happened in our country and
if you think back with me try to
remember I know a couple years ago but
if you remember that very day something
very very important happened to all of
us and that was at McDonald&#39;s breakfast
so McDonald&#39;s that there we wouldn&#39;t be
able to eat french fries or ice cream so
we were so frustrated then we noticed
that there was this whole storm brewing
on social media so what we we was we see
that my best friend and I would sit at
the back of the classroom and we created
this mean this means old McDonald&#39;s
y-you know and we wanted to share this
with our friends how we realized that
there was no platform in Singapore that
would allow us to share this beam
locally where no foreigners would
understand and it was highly sort of
trending and it was very very much local
so we created a page that very day
called SK and we shared it and within
the next couple of hours a few hundred
people came to like the post and we will
completely hold on this whole addiction
of content creation and we were very
very fortunate because the very next
thing that happened was that the
government decided to announce in 2013
that there were six point nine million
people living in Singapore by 2030 and
that created another social media so
people started complaining people for
calves
oh don&#39;t vote for the right party at the
next election but we couldn&#39;t be
bothered and we were not that interested
in politics anyways but what we were
more interested in was visualizing house
and this really put us out there and so
if you remember that you think back with
me sometime in June 2013 again we
experienced one of the best gifts from
our neighbors right so we had the haze
and the haze was a period because
everyone was stuck and there was no more
school there was no work everyone was
back home online and everyone was forced
to consume our content is a secret
project we switch one event blueberries
and if you&#39;re Taurus and you kind of see
the same thing I&#39;m going to go
the same ones back on his journey to the
west&#39; suicune would have lost his ship
for he travel through the Mia&#39;s region
and he would lose his shit for in
Singapore so that was a strange period
for us but very very fun for our guys at
asparagus we started creating some of
the spectral content in 2013 and moving
on to 2014 2014 was the year when we had
the World Cup remember and if you
remember this gentleman called Andy and
he was was one of our favorite
characters because he was
and so what does that mean and his
father and this became the butt of jokes
all around the world Jimmy Fallon was
talking about it on his late-night show
if you remember and what was even more
brilliant in 2014 was that a condo used
Anderson as a model and so and he had a
beautiful ending to this story it&#39;s
about the pets all the money on Germany
wins the World Cup but it&#39;s a lot of
money and wise economy so we move on to
2050 where you know why this time we
were creating memes for the last two
years part time and we started 2015 by
deciding that we want to do this for the
rest of our lives or at least for as
long as we can so we dropped everything
that we had and we went full-time and
the first thing that happened in 2015
was our founding father passed away and
this was an awkward moment for us
because we felt that it would be
completely insensitive to be joking
during this period of mourning
so we declared the to meet blackout
where we were not launched a single post
not a single joke and we will completely
stun what would we do for two weeks what
would we talk about and what would our
audience view so what was amazing is
that in these two weeks as people who
were sort of commemorating his life and
what he had done for the country we
started to receive a lot of stories from
our inbox stories of kindness acts of
sort of kindness as people queuing up
remember as you&#39;re queuing up the
elderly the sick the fragile the free oh
they were all given free water free
seeds free food as they could
and we started to share these stories on
our platform through means and for the
first time we were not talking about
anything funny we&#39;re talking about acts
of kindness and our performance was at
an all-time high some of the best
performing content
and that was when we realized we had
become more than just jokes more than
just laughter our mission back then was
to bring your daily dose of Singaporean
humor but in 2015 we realized that
because so much more than that
so we hosted the C games in June that
year and if you remember there were two
to be no athletes came for the diving
event they went on the platform and then
they jumped off and then it flat on
their back splashed into the water came
out to each other - like a boss and it
was even more amazing when we launched
that video went viral is that two
athletes came to our page and they left
the comment and that actually started an
international sort of intonation debate
you know all the Filipinos came in
through through as gag and started
commenting and debating with our
Singaporean fans and that led to sort of
a strange intonation debate on our page
which was very very fun for us and at
the end of the year we end the year on a
somber note again when the students got
into the accident indicated really again
what a tumour sort of stopped the jokes
and because it was a really sort of
tragedy and and we wanted to represent
Singaporeans on the other side to thank
the mountain guides will coin all the
way up the mountain to carry some of our
injured students back to home on their
backs and on behalf of Singaporeans we
wanted to say thank you
so sue Minter straight into 2016 2016
saw the evolution the greatest country
interesting because we launched this I
think at 9 p.m. that evening we woke up
the next morning we looked at the
analytics this piece was seen by 60
million people all around me so 2016 was
all about paranoid and straight into
2017 2017 was the year that we started
doing a lot of videos if you come to a
skank if you follow us down you see a
lot of videos and we started investing a
lot of our time entertaining you guys
want short-form videos that you can
watch in your mobile and then toilet on
a train
anyway and more importantly we started
to take the whole idea of videos across
the border because we were reaching
about 5-minute information and a lot of
them started writing into us to say hey
why don&#39;t you love us we started videos
as well and you might have seen some of
this but saying thoughts comes when
relations come to Singapore what do they
do you know when you lose your mom stop
away with what what happens today and we
started creating a lot of content from
the Malaysian audience in bahasa so we
started this at the back of a classroom
in 2012 and we went full-time in 2015
today we do over 10 million people every
single week across many platforms run by
a team of 30 people and we distribute
content in Singapore through these
platforms across seven channels we
launch about five to ten pieces every
single day 365 days a year
on Malaysia we in Malaysia we launch
content through these four platforms
about 3 to 5 times every single day and
our mission is really to make your day a
better one when you come in at the end
of a long school day coming to any of
our platforms
watch it and we create all of this
content to entertain and to engage you
guys and so that&#39;s been a mission that
within our pond and it&#39;s been an amazing
journey and like to share with you three
lessons that I&#39;ve learned in my journey
on building this company so the first
thing that I want to share with you is
the importance of painfully so play is
very important to me and I&#39;d love to
play it ever since I was a kid I spent a
lot of time outdoors playing sports I
spent a lot of time indoors playing
computer games or console games and I&#39;d
love to play even you know even as I
went into young adulthood
I found myself still playing even though
when I had a kid I was still playing and
I realized that I would never stop
playing plays such a big part of me and
so when I built this company one of the
key things I thought about was Barcelona
Barcelona is a group of 11 men coming
together to play football and because
they play so well together they form
this synergy as a team and the way that
they play is just beautiful it&#39;s
absolutely captivating and because the
way that they play is so captivating
millions of people around the world both
automatically and I and I thought about
that for a moment and I said look we
kind of take this whole element of
playing into our company culture and do
that everything so as you come to my
company right now you will see any group
of people different groups of people
playing football playing air hockey
playing card games playing ping pong
playing everything they can get their
hands on and we play every single day
and we take time every six months to go
overseas to do all sorts of stuff dinner
so this massage doing so a jungle ATV
trails this was us doing paintball and I
truly truly believe that women who put
people come together we play
intentionally and play frequently that&#39;s
when the magic magically effect of
building bonds moving its energy and
then soon enough it brings millions of
people together and that&#39;s why I believe
all content is successful because we
play the second thing I want to talk
about is that great Islam
so I was not the best student in school
and I did work very hard and I realized
at some point in university early on in
university that I was never going to be
the top student or maybe top three even
and all the extra hours that I spent
trying to work in just maybe three more
PowerPoint slides or five more notes it
was not gonna add up to imaginal any any
additional value instead I started
thinking about how I could spend my time
meaningfully to learn and learning to me
comes in the form of experiences one of
my first jobs in university was to
become a real estate salesperson at the
age of 21 and that has become one of the
most pivotal things and the hardest
lessons in the best lessons I&#39;ve learned
is because I got out of the classroom
and I decided to learn instead of just
focusing on my grades and I took that
again to to my company when I hire
people when I had to hire my first three
people five people ten people number 30
strong every single individual in my
team I did not hire them because they
had good grades or fantastic see me in
fact I think more than half of them have
never even seen their senior instead I
asked and tell me a story tell me
something interesting that about you
tell me a skill that you have that
nobody has tell me a story and some of
the best people I work with did not
complete PSOE
they dropped out of private school never
made it through private school some of
them never finished secondary school
some of them one of them one of my best
content creators used to work as a TV
salesman in a small town in Malaysia
teaching people how to use the different
functions of the TV and today he creates
content that&#39;s constantly seen by
millions all because I looked at him
thought that is great but by what he
could bring and what stories he could
tell and how told them
and I think that that&#39;s something really
really important for young people to
really consider not just looking at your
grades but really spending time learning
learning things that you want to learn
and the third thing I&#39;d like to share a
few is this term called achieving
failure so this term is coined by a man
named Aaron Ruiz every breeze is the
author of a book called in his data and
in Asia especially we we hate the word
failure right failure something we try
to avoid at all costs at all stages of
our lives but at some point I realized
that failures is not a matter of whether
it will happen but it&#39;s a matter of when
they will happen because it will happen
and I feel tremendously and different
points in my life I failed exams I had
failed relationships I have failed
businesses and one of the biggest
failures of my life was when I was 26
years old I went out of fashion of
university I went out into the venture
marketing venture finance market and I
had an idea I raised some venture money
and I had this business plan that I
wanted to execute I was extremely
optimistic I went out there I pushed for
about a year and completely fell face
fell and I was completely smashed I was
devastated I was I was just hit so hard
but I look back today
and I realized that that 12 months that
I spent the suing my first business gave
me some of the best lessons I would
never learn in the classroom or your
textbook it gave me lessons and
motivates me every single day till today
of things that I shouldn&#39;t do or things
that I should do more and I think
there&#39;s nowhere nowhere else better to
learn these lessons than by achieving
failure so I wanna reference this quote
from one of the greatest basketball
players of all time Michael Jordan
calling the goal so Jordan miss over
9000 shots in his career he&#39;s lost 300
games 26 times and Trust
to take the game-winning shot and missed
he fell over and over and over again in
his life and that is why it&#39;s so with
that I want to encourage all of you
spend time to play it don&#39;t be afraid to
play focus on learning get off the
classroom learn things that will leave
long-term value in your life and don&#39;t
be afraid to feel a chief thank you very
much
