with a show of hands how many of you
changed your mobile phones in the last
two years great and how many of you
installed software updates on your
Mobile&#39;s or your laptops in the last one
year and now tell me how many of you
installed some of these updates the
minute you became aware of them now what
does this mean from where I stand it
shows us that technology is constantly
changing and continuous enhancement is
the only key to staying in touch with
the outside world we must have great
technology or we will be left out we
won&#39;t be able to use the systems we all
know what happened with Kodak Nokia and
Blackberry just like technology we as
people have also undergone continuous
development living in our world means to
adapt or die when we don&#39;t upgrade
technology let&#39;s say if you&#39;re talking
about your phone it will throw
challenges are us the phone will slow
down we&#39;ll start to hang the battery
will start draining faster and a million
and one other crazy situations can you
see the parallels where if we don&#39;t have
great ourselves and acquire relevant
skills we could end up in boredom
anxiety depression perhaps living in low
self esteem constantly complaining
gossiping and more we as humanity have
come a long way journeying through a
Quebec cities and now we are entering
the age of exponential disruption well
it&#39;s time for another upgrade but what
do we need what is going to work this
made me sit up and think what got me
here how was I able to handle all
various challenges difficulties that
came my way and still progress and feel
happy about it what the skills I engaged
unique to me or was there something in
common with several other successful
people that I knew so I started reading
and researching having dialogues with
various experts behavioural enthusiasts
to see if this was in line with their
findings and their own experiences as
well I finally funneled down all these
learnings to three fundamental skills
that are going to help us in the long
run so instead of changing them we could
just transyl them to fit our needs and
the best part about these skills is that
everyone is capable of building them and
that includes everyone present here
today as well I call these skills the
car for an enriching journey car is a
set of skills that we are going to need
to be able to not only survive but also
thrive amidst this disruption car is
independent of the decisions you make
all the directions you choose so you
could be a student or a professional and
entrepreneur or an industrialist
practicing car will contribute
significantly in the fulfillment of most
of your professional and personal
ambitions you&#39;ll find clues to what CA
our car stands for in those short
snippets that I&#39;m going to now share
with you 26 June 1998 I got a call on my
landline no buyers weren&#39;t common then
may I speak with Vinnie Ajmer oh I said
yeah that&#39;s me is this a good time to
talk yeah tell me Vinnie I&#39;m calling
from jet airways congratulations you&#39;ve
been selected this was my first job and
it was a really really difficult job to
get back then 19 years ago of in 1998 I
was super excited and she asked me she
could
and she said are you thrilled yeah
totally and then she went about giving
me details of getting some medical tests
done and asked if I was free the
following week I said yeah I am great
just one more thing yeah from today
she said drop they are the word is yes
thus began my discovery of the power of
communication that one instruction
changed the way I looked at
communicating forever I started noticing
nuances in language in fact even till
today I see so many senior leaders also
that use words such as yeah in their
vocabulary and it takes away from their
personality and the seriousness they
ought to bring to formal setups at Jet
Airways we were told that we had to
greet as many people as we saw in a day
we thought this was a joke but we stood
corrected when they said even if it
meant as many as two to three hundred
people I don&#39;t think that was cool at
all I was a complete introvert and this
was way outside my comfort zone but well
you do what you gotta do so I did just
that within a short span of time I
realized that the crux of effective
communication in fact was in interaction
in listening in using the right body
language and also in making people feel
comfortable so they&#39;d open up to me I
started learning about their thought
processes their culture the nature of
their work and I&#39;m still always curious
for more that practice which I started
nineteen years ago I continue to carry
on I realized that technical skills will
take me places but what will truly
differentiate me and take me everywhere
are my communication skills
communication isn&#39;t a one-way street we
all love to talk but also we all love to
be hard
and we also love the ones who here so I
started listening not only with my eyes
in my ears but also with my heart and
this became an accelerator in my car of
fulfillment helping me establish really
deep and meaningful connections over
time a recent example was when I was
coaching a successful serial
entrepreneur his concern was that he
couldn&#39;t take his venture to the next
level and from all the effective
questioning and his demeanor I realized
that he in fact wasn&#39;t uninterested as
he portrayed he was he said he tended to
lose interest after achieving a certain
milestone but he didn&#39;t seem that he
didn&#39;t seem uninterested he was in fact
quite troubled about it I brought this
to his notice because I could say from
his demeanor and then with effective
coaching I got him to think deeper and
share his real concerns what emerged was
an aha moment for him he had found
clarity not just in his thoughts he
realized that it was in his short
interest span but a wig undefined target
that was holding him back and my aha
moment was that I listened effectively
meaning I paid attention not only to his
words but also to his feelings and
helped him find his answers today the
foundation of my initiative personnage
rests on this understanding of people it
is important that we communicate to
connect March 2014 I got lucky with an
opportunity to pitch my services to one
of India&#39;s largest jewelry retailers I
was barely a month into entrepreneurship
in during the pitch they asked me who I
are other corporate retail clients I
froze I had none it had only been a
month I didn&#39;t really know what to say I
was so sure of winning this and
suddenly I saw it slipping I knew I had
lost this contract I somehow pulled
myself together and decided to tell them
the truth
that you would be my first corporate big
client surprisingly with all the
likelihood of losing the contract I felt
pretty confident when I said it had I
lied about it
or made up about having other big
clients to not risk it given that it&#39;s
quite easy to drop names I know I would
have faltered but my choice was between
the easy room and the tough right
expectedly Devore disappointed and they
asked me why then should we work with
you instead of others this time I told
them what holds true even today that I
give my all in whatever I do
and hence I leave myself with no choice
but to excel a week later they signed up
with me I realized that they had bought
my conviction but more than that they
had bought my authenticity people are ok
if you&#39;re not a hundred percent what
missed them is when you&#39;re not authentic
about it it&#39;s really hard and exhausting
to constantly try and understand or
trust someone who&#39;s faking it now you
may wonder where did this whole
awareness and intent for
entrepreneurship emerge from well
personality continues to take shape over
years and decades over seventeen years
ago I took off international to start my
world expand my world with Singapore
Airlines and took off with me the idea
of becoming super popular fitting in
making the mark wherever I went I
started sharing my apartment with a
bunch of friends and for the next couple
of weeks went out of my way trying to
please them I took on 80% of all the
chores I started paying bills for things
I didn&#39;t use and generally started
getting bossed around I thought I was
doing a great job with them but in no
time
I started hating it I felt taken for
granted I got angry and resentful and of
course I realized that this was all my
own doing I had not been honest with
myself I was never this wonderful or
amazing with my own family and here in
my desperation to fit in that kind of
lost the plot it struck me that
inauthenticity isn&#39;t only when you are
trying to deceive or manipulate other
people but it&#39;s also when you are trying
to be larger than your own boots I moved
out and in the bargain I lost my friends
over the next many years whenever I
started falling for this temptation of
masking myself to please others or for
instant gratification I would
immediately check myself and get real
again there was too much to lose in
trading my authenticity for someone
else&#39;s approval by being myself my
exchanges were effortless they were
natural and people related to me and
accepted me for who I was
so I urge all of you to be real be
yourself trust the person that you are
not the one that you think you should be
authenticity is in effect the purest and
deepest form of confidence 2003 I got
married
a big fat Indian wedding the ultimate
dream sequence you get the picture right
it was all that I ever wanted yeah it
was all that I ever wanted and now I had
it I couldn&#39;t wait to start my happily
ever after
sadly that dream shattered in no time my
marriage failed and my world came
crashing down I didn&#39;t really understand
what happened and I couldn&#39;t really make
sense of it but I decided not to indulge
my grief and that is when the battle
really began between my resilience and
the devastating reality of what was to
follow this happened almost about 14
years ago it was in common clays back
then I had to move on but it was so hard
to pick up from where I had left I had
thrived in my previous roles and now I
had already lost two crucial years in
looking for direction I restarted my
career with the best option available at
the time even though it meant owning
lesser than before but here&#39;s this I
ended up earning way more in terms of
reclaiming myself and we gaining a lot
of my lost self esteem and some of my
self-confidence
in a few years
opportunity presented itself to move
forward with a corporate SR group now
this was another challenge altogether it
was a different industry from aviation
to corporate it was a different role it
needed different skillsets including
Microsoft Office but I had no clue how
to work it back then and of course most
importantly needed a completely
different level of Tolerance fortunately
I guess the forces of nature balanced it
with brilliant mentors and bosses that I
had out there so I decided to slog it
out I worked really hard learned the
ropes and ended up flourishing in that
corporate role in retrospect I think
this was the turning point in my career
I had refused to stay down and out
there&#39;s no manual on life situations
right and also there&#39;s no prediction
there are no processes shocks are
surprises you&#39;ve just got to jump in
accept the reality and then do your best
a few years down I graduated to another
thought I&#39;ve done this why was I - not
for July for myself of my own back now
and that&#39;s how my company personage came
about you can clap at this point
this still remains the highlight of my
life so I&#39;d say am I happy about it
tons but it hasn&#39;t all been plain
sailing you see I am single woman
standing here in front of you who
started her own venture at 34 with her
own money and little business experience
in the country we live in
this can be frowned upon even by the
self-proclaimed torchbearers of
open-mindedness and modernity now I
don&#39;t know why this is but I experienced
this reality ever so often in different
manifestations yet that hasn&#39;t
discouraged me rather it&#39;s fueled my
fire you&#39;ve got to stick it out you&#39;ve
got to stay strong and you&#39;ve got to
take it through and the Falcom of this
is resilience arguably one of the most
important qualities and one that I&#39;ve
held on to and continue to hold on to
for a very long time nothing comes easy
you&#39;ve got to toil you&#39;ve got to sweat
it out to feel and experience the kind
of satisfaction that moves you from
within the times when I doubt myself I
focus on my strengths to me resilience
isn&#39;t about being perfect or independent
always know you&#39;ve got to find the
strength to continue maybe in the people
that do love you
for me that is my family and my closest
friends who&#39;ve seen me through all this
they&#39;ve nurtured me and encouraged me
but another really great way to build
your resilience is to just go all out do
your things and not worry about failing
if it doesn&#39;t work out learn from it and
start over all great and successful
people have failed at some point but
they do not feel failure it&#39;s how you
pick yourself up afterwards and what you
do next now when I think about it I
think it has always been in the
discomfort of my comfort that I keep
discovering my growth quotient and hence
I still choose to keep moving forward
and pushing the boundaries so in summary
what has driven me this far is my car
communication authenticity and
resilience I use it in my coaching I use
it in my trainings I use it with my
friends I use it in my relationships and
I&#39;ve always found amazing results
practicing car will help you connect
effectively with the world and with the
much-discussed volatile uncertain
complex and ambiguous environment you
want people who connect at a deeper
level people who are real and people who
are resilient people who not only
express theirs better but who can also
understand you when you need such a
person you want to be with such a person
I say how about being such a person
right now you are all studying but when
you take off into the real world
meet corporate entrepreneurship
bachelorhood relationships bear in mind
I urge you to bear in mind these three
tenets of communication authenticity and
resilience your car to build on that
will drive you through an enriching
journey and take you to the successes
source pile we are all perfectly capable
of driving a BMW or an ambassador the
choice is yours
thank you
[Applause]
