so I raised my hand in class puzzled by
what I had just heard but didn&#39;t God
create the world six thousand years ago
that was me in fifth grade growing up in
a Christian sect made sure I had a few
beliefs that was in conflict with basic
facts like dinosaurs actually existed in
my late teens a lot of Pierre started
challenging me on my views about the age
of the earth so I had to find out for
myself I went home I googled something
to the effect of evolution is life this
is known as the confirmation bias or
brains automatic tendency to only look
for information which we already agree
with this is why most people never buy
books with opposing viewpoints so no one
seems to agree on how many there are but
on Wikipedia they have a list of 166
ways our brains make us think in rather
illogical ways we call them cognitive
biases and we all have them except you
of course
you&#39;re not like me you&#39;re always
rational as a matter of fact this talk
is not even for you it&#39;s run literally
everyone else so most philosophers used
to think that we were fundamentally
rational but today it&#39;s a different
story
especially the work in social science by
Jonathan Heights and Nobel laureate
Daniel Kahneman suggests we make all our
opinions on an instinctual emotional
level first and then try to justify them
rationally after the fact so let me
explain with an example let&#39;s say you&#39;re
on a diet then suddenly you really feel
like eating ice cream chances are your
brain will help you find a few pretty
good reasons you can have just a tiny
bit of ice cream the problem appears
when you think you&#39;re being rational but
in reality you have already decided on
an emotional level that you would like
some ice cream and at this point you
just try to make yourself feel better
so picture it like this you are like a
judge in a courtroom the voice in your
head is like a prosecutor in this case
the judge really wants some ice cream so
the prosecutor gives the judge all the
reasons he can have just a little bit of
ice cream and the judge decides to eat
the ice cream thinking that he made a
pretty rational choice and we do stupid
stuff like this all the time
but a lot of the time however wired to
act is not in line with basic moral
principles in an out-group bias makes us
divide people into groups France enemies
these groups can be based on ethnicity
religion political affiliation
nationality and at our very worst out
group bias makes us treat people from
other groups as less human than us and
more like animals can you imagine the
consequences of unknowingly dehumanizing
people while simultaneously believing
you&#39;re a good rational person you don&#39;t
have to because they&#39;re all throughout
history most southern Americans used to
be fine with slavery
most Germans loved Hitler so how do you
know for sure that you&#39;re not in any way
on the wrong side of history and where
the majority have been for as long as we
can remember
these are big issues so how do we solve
them critical thinking so as you know I
believed in a lot of insane stuff quite
obviously actually after leaving my
religion I started mindlessly
mindlessly accepting outlandish
conspiracy theories like the one where
the world is secretly run by
interdimensional lizards yeah I was that
guy
but that all changed when I started
studying philosophy and I began on a
journey of systematically reviewing all
my beliefs to eliminate the ones that
were false immoral or just you know
plain stupid
but how I mean I mean because it feels
like I come quite a long way but I mean
how do I know let&#39;s again revisit the
court case metaphor so you are the judge
the voice in your head is the prosecutor
what&#39;s missing in an actual court they
have a third person called the defendant
her job is to argue with the prosecutor
why because they know people can be
falsely prosecuted if the judge only
hears one side of the case and to me the
essence of critical thinking it&#39;s just
that to argue with yourself so for
example the next time you are on a diet
and you would really like some ice cream
just tell yourself all the reasons you
shouldn&#39;t have that ice cream and then I
mean probably you end up doing a better
choice at during the next week
you&#39;ll probably stumble over some stupid
opinion you totally disagree with but
instead of doing what you&#39;re wired to do
I wanted to do the opposite know that
every almost every opinion has been
stupid at one point so try to disprove
yourself because you might not be right
about everything
so why is this important
it&#39;s easy to see everyone else&#39;s
mistakes not so easy to view your own
mistakes objectively critical thinking
is a great solution for that problem it
will definitely help you with decision
making in the most important areas of
your life like money health career
relationships but most importantly I
believe this is the next step in human
evolution we have learned more about the
brain for the last ten years than
through all of history combined and it
seems that even though we&#39;re definitely
smarter than Apes we don&#39;t always behave
that way they form tribes and fight each
other we divide ourselves up into
fictitious groups based on nationality
ethnicity political affiliation and well
fight each other but we have the ability
to overpower our animalistic instincts
with reasoning and going into this new
digital age I believe it is essential
that we do it we&#39;re facing a ton of
challenges and we might disagree on what
they are but my big promise is that
implementing this idea will make both
naming and solving all of these problems
a lot easier so let&#39;s do it
let us override our instincts in order
to become better human beasts it is
essential if we want to create a better
tomorrow thank you
