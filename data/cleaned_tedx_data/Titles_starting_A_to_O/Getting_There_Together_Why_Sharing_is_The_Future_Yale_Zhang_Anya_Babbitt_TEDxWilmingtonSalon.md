it is said we learn everything we need
to learn in kindergarten my friend Julie
didn&#39;t go to kindergarten yet she
learned everything she needed to know at
a young age julie grew up in a remote
village far away in southeast asia where
she and her mom would share taxis filled
to the brim with people on the way to
the local market Shara transportation
was the norm for Julie and still this is
a way of transportation today especially
in remote villages in the developing
world people can&#39;t afford vehicles or
fuel sharing is perhaps a way of life a
necessity and arguably what we&#39;ve seen
in our travels to these countries is
that the developing world is more
advanced perhaps because their needs are
more basic so I know this is a rather
extreme example but how do we teach
rapidly growing cities to be more basic
I wrote my college thesis on the Kyoto
treaty the reduction of carbon emissions
and after living in such cities as Los
Angeles and New York City probably two
of the most congested cities in the
nation it became very clear to us that
now is the time that we need to reformat
these cities through innovation and
technology but technology is not always
the answer and dating back to the Oregon
settler days we see that settlers banded
together also out of necessity and
utility this way of sharing was probably
logistically very sensible although
probably less so for the horses and
mules in the modern world we see
something called cultural resistance
where we hold on so tightly to our cars
as time passes us by as we sit stuck in
traffic we are a part of this traffic
movement solo travelers
who although we share history and we
share online very eagerly we see that
while people get to the age of driving
that they forget the most basic
principle we learned in kindergarten and
that is to share now Yale will tell and
share the rest of the story thank you
Anna a popular myth about the shared
economy is that transportation network
companies such as uber and lyft are
somehow killing the taxi industry that&#39;s
not true
it&#39;s the supply-side economics that are
killing them this is a New York taxi
medallion and they&#39;re about 13,000 of
them a few years ago they would cost
about a million dollars to purchase and
we did writers would end up paying the
costs now thanks to the transportation
network companies and their investors on
Wall Street who are subsidizing the cost
of every single ride the cost per
medallion has come down to only a few
hundred thousand dollars but will that
business model innovation prove out once
the spigot of funding runs dry and they
have to achieve profitability we
actually don&#39;t know the answer to that
well there&#39;s also talk of of Peak Oil of
somehow we&#39;ve discovered all the
reserves we&#39;ll ever find
but what we&#39;re really living in is the
era of Peak stuff you know other people
talk about how 95 percent of the time a
car is is sitting there not being used
and that seems like a wasteful
percentage but did you know that an
average drill is only used for 15
minutes 15 minutes in its entire life by
its owner what the shared economy does
is it frees and unlocks this these
dormant resources and frees them from
their uselessness do you really care
about the service that&#39;s being delivered
or how you get there as long as you get
to accomplish your goals you don&#39;t and
so there&#39;s always talks about smart
everything connected hyper
oops you know well yeah maybe you&#39;ll get
a fridge one day that&#39;ll tell your
grocery store that your milk has gone
bad and you&#39;ll have a new carton waiting
for you because Amazon flew it to you on
a drone by the time you got back
sure but what&#39;s the biggest challenge
for smart cities is not any of these
technologies technologies will always
come around and new things technologies
can be invented to try to solve all
these problems the biggest problem is
really the rules and regulations
how can cities be smart if you have to
build new buildings with a high number
of parking spots or there&#39;s no
affordable housing so people have to
live in the exurbs or worse yet old
buildings that are small can&#39;t be torn
down to build new buildings with higher
density that is the true Smart City
challenge and in terms of density in
terms of space usage yes
space is the biggest problem if everyone
is driving by themselves in their own
cars it will clog up the highways
there&#39;s no doubt and in fact in cities
that are dense like New York only 30% of
the people who drive to work but in the
rest of this country over 80% of people
drive to work every day and that&#39;s a
huge difference but around the world
cities all around the world are
experiencing rapid urbanization and when
they experienced his rapid urbanization
they have to choose will they choose the
American Way of two cars per household
or will they choose something different
something sustainable something shared
such as transit or biking well some bike
activists have already gone out of their
way to put bamboo frames around their
bicycles riding around to show how much
extra space the car takes up maybe we
can use that as an inspiration to think
about how we can develop shared vehicles
of the future and the best part yet is
that companies like uber and lyft and
their Wall Street investors have done a
great job of convincing us to downsize
and to be okay with sharing that space
with other people so maybe it will be
like the movie Minority Report where
vehicles that are autonomous pods drive
individuals to and back from work that
but that&#39;s just one vision of the future
the truth is we&#39;ve been participating in
the shared economy for forever from the
covered wagons of Oregon Trail to the
shared taxis from going back and forth
from Asian villages or actually you
probably took part in the shared economy
today by using one of the most popular
autonomous vehicles in existence the
elevator when you get into an elevator
and you press a button it takes you
exactly where you need to go and if
you&#39;re sharing that space with someone
else you don&#39;t mind you chitchat
maybe they&#39;ll deliver you an elevator
pitch maybe not but and when was the
last time you paid attention to the
brand of the elevator that took you to
your floor exactly that&#39;s our vision for
the future a future where the shared
economy delivers a platform that&#39;s
greater than the provider where
transportation is like a utility like
water or electricity
we&#39;re aware how you get there in what
vehicle what brand is not as important
than the experience of getting there so
imagine if we will a world in which the
shared economy is in total alignment
where transportation platforms provide
access for everyone which helps our
cities our communities and the
environment and where we learn to share
our highways and byways and finally get
people moving again and we don&#39;t know
the future of transportation and where
it&#39;s headed but we do know that you need
to get where you&#39;re going and by doing
so it makes the platform more important
than the vehicle and in kindergarten and
we learn our ABCs like I won&#39;t sing the
song for you but now we&#39;re looking at
how do we move from point A to point B
so that we can all see a better future
for the next generation thank you
you
