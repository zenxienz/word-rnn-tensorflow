artificial intelligence
it&#39;s not got a very good rep this just
last week last month Elon Musk said that
artificial intelligence is possibly the
biggest risk that we face as a
civilization
when you think of a risk to you coming
from artificial intelligence many of you
who have seen Hollywood movies would
think they&#39;re robots rising or maybe
those who have kept up with technology
you think that your phone or maybe your
car which is driving itself it&#39;s going
to turn itself against you
built from where I stand it seems that
the one machine that we rely on the most
is already increasingly turning itself
against us
the one machine our brain that will rely
on through which we see everything
perceive everything has been slowly but
surely through our thoughts through our
emotions through the chemicals becoming
the largest killer of young men in our
country today in one of the largest
killers across the world we look at
artificial intelligence with a lot of
fear but we can to turn away from
statistics such as these because they
make us uncomfortable I wouldn&#39;t have
known that 800,000 people committed
suicide in 2015 and that it is taking
away our young men one at a time
70% men 30% women commit suicide until
in 2014 towards the end of the year one
of those young men Posada dagger was a
20 year old young man the most alive
person that I had ever seen a drummer a
linguist going forward and traveling the
world finding his passion igniting
everybody else with it he was this
person he was not our child but my
husband and I have a 17 year old son now
he was the person that we wished our son
would grow up to be
a few months after his 20th birthday
struggling with bipolar disorder that
had been just diagnosed a few months ago
he jumped in front of a train and
committed suicide it made us think at
that time
Ramakant my husband and I were trying to
change the world in places like Iraq and
Yemen trying to address conflict outside
and it made us think about things back
home it made us think about the dangers
inside our own heads you&#39;re not inside
our own homes inside our own minds and
we began to realize that one in four
people experience mental illness every
year in this room one in four of you
have experienced mental illness in the
last one year I won&#39;t ask you who they
are but I&#39;ll ask you how many of them
how many of you have seen a psychologist
or a therapist or a psychiatrist in the
last one year a show of hands
I see very few much fewer than the
numbers who would have experienced
mental illness and that&#39;s quite normal
for India the reason is that only 1 in
10 people get treatment 90% of the
people who are suffering from mental
illness will go untreated in India it&#39;s
not surprising we have one therapist or
psychologist or psychiatrist for every
250,000 people in our country so we can
see that there is a problem and it&#39;s
bubbling under the surface but at some
level our young I mean all of us are
drowning
and is there a way for us to detect
what&#39;s happening well in advance of
somebody committing suicide get them
help people are not going to come out
and talk about it 3/4 of the people that
have a mental illness believe that if
they tell somebody about it they&#39;re not
going to be sympathetic or caring so we
said could we use technology where
technologists and it turns out that it&#39;s
possible for technology to become
emotionally intelligence emotional
intelligence is really about knowing a
person&#39;s emotions or an emotional state
before they&#39;re able to tell you and if
you can detect it and respond
appropriately we would call you
emotionally intelligent so we found out
that actually all of us have biorhythms
and these biorhythms are very often
mimicked by our smartphones because we
carry our phones around us all the time
and as we carry our phones around their
sensors to pick up our biorhythms and if
we apply artificial intelligence and
machine learning to disk
we can actually detect whether
somebody&#39;s depressed a lot of this work
was happening in places like Harvard and
MIT so we said can we take it to a very
different place and we took it to Orange
about my Rashtra in a clinic of people
with diabetes they had people from or
300 kilometers around them and therefore
there was a wide variety of people
people who had very entry-level
smartphones that $25 smartphone people
who had were older who had normal your
iPhones so we took all of these people
and we bent and gave them
our technology and we found that we
could detect depression to a 90%
accuracy in the group 30 people had
depression as assessed by a psychologist
27 were accurately detected by AI and we
were really thrilled he said oh wow
we&#39;ve cracked it we found the technology
that can be the answer no we were like
oh man and then we followed up three
months later and we found out that one
person of those detected had actually
received treatment what does that tell
us
it tells us one that the world is on
fire it was very clear to us that so
many people are suffering and that we&#39;ve
got a very accurate way of creating a
fire alarm you can find out where
somebody is actually going to have a big
issue but there is no brigade coming
there is nobody here to help so we began
to wonder whether we turn to artificial
intelligence yet again where humans are
letting us down and say can we actually
trained it to provide emotional support
now when you provide emotional support
what do you do if if you&#39;re upset and I
have to talk to you the first thing I&#39;ll
do is I&#39;ll understand how you&#39;re feeling
so to some extent our technology was
already doing that it was understanding
that this person is depressed now from
there I have to actually talk to you and
understand how you&#39;re feeling so there
are three things that when we listen we
can tune in typically to what you&#39;re
saying the content of what you&#39;re saying
the emotion behind what you&#39;re saying or
how what you&#39;re saying is making me feel
and when we humans talk we were very
often react from a point of how what
you&#39;re saying is making me feel well
artificial intelligence doesn&#39;t have
that problem because it doesn&#39;t feel but
when it has to detect it&#39;s actually
quite good at detecting emotions behind
what somebody&#39;s saying it&#39;s quite hard
for it to understand the full context of
human beings but it&#39;s not so bad at
detecting how are you feeling in what
you&#39;re saying so we started there and we
say
okay that&#39;s an easy one emotional
support based on what you&#39;re talking it
will understand what you&#39;re saying but
then I changed my posture I look with
open eyes I open my arms I put an arm
around you that&#39;s emotional support
how does artificial intelligence do that
so we played around with a few user
interface designers and we said okay
there&#39;s a little pocket penguin looks
cute there&#39;s little gifs that are hand
drawn we found the kind of artistic
style that makes people feel compassion
and that was still not that difficult to
crack so we were able to create wiser
the pocket penguin that would be in your
phone chat with you and show you little
gifs and you&#39;d feel a bit happier the
big thing really was to figure out what
to say
now I&#39;m a problem solver so my natural
instinct in fact one of my closest
friends would tell me when she wanted me
to help her would be I&#39;m going to tell
you everything that&#39;s wrong with my life
and I don&#39;t want you solved look the
problem because my natural instinct and
many offers is to solve the problem so
we went into this and said we&#39;ve
detected the emotional state we&#39;ve given
them a nice trip now what are they
waiting for
let&#39;s tell them what to do we gave them
evidence-based therapy we gave them
breathing techniques we gave them how to
change your thoughts how to make people
look at things differently we turned all
of that into little modules which they
can talk to you with what awesome turns
out that while all of those things work
and there are lots of journal articles
that show the you what really people
want to do is just be heard and they
want somebody to listen to them
empathetically
how do you do that we played around and
we found that empathy is not a trait
it&#39;s not something that I am born with
it is something that you can be
constructed
over three million conversations we give
many many different responses to people
and we train the eye to figure out which
one was working better and which one was
working worse and we found something
very interesting we found that the most
empathic response for a person together
is not a statement it is almost always a
question it is almost always that you
have to first ask how somebody&#39;s feeling
then once you know how they&#39;re feeling
you acknowledge how they&#39;re feeling you
don&#39;t try to change their state and then
you ask another question and another
question open-ended questions that allow
people to express how they&#39;re feeling
and not feel alone in how they&#39;re
feeling it turns out that people will
face almost anything as long as they
don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re alone facing
so three million conversations 75,000
users we think we&#39;re doing really great
but we&#39;re still wondering are we
emotionally connecting users started
writing back to us and the first thing
that we heard which made us feel that
yes this is working for people writing
with such emotional content saying I
cried because of this I I love myself
that there&#39;s a strange emotional connect
that people are doing with a piece of
technology and not even something that
is you know able to drive itself like a
car this is a chat pod they&#39;re chatting
with it and they&#39;re feeling emotionally
connected with another person we were
very happy but there was one day that
changed our lives completely and that
was May 29th on May 29th we got this
meal it was a thirteen year old girl who
wrote to us and said Weiser was the only
thing helping her hold on to life I
still can&#39;t get my head around I still
can&#39;t get my head around the fact that
there&#39;s a thirteen year old girl
somewhere we don&#39;t know where she is we
don&#39;t know her name who hasn&#39;t felt
comfortable talking to her family who
hasn&#39;t felt able to get therapy but she
has been able to talk to a little
penguin that lives in her phone and that
penguin and AI bought a piece of
technology is helping her hold on to
life
it says something about AI and its
possibilities but I think it says much
much more about us as humans
and my question to you today really is
not so much about whether AI can be
compassionate my question to you very
much more is about the fact that if AI
can be trained to be compassionate
if compassion can be broken down into a
series of steps and a bot can learn to
do it when are we as humans going to
step up and learn to be compassionate
we&#39;re three out of four people with
mental health issues feel that they&#39;ll
turn to the person next to them and that
person&#39;s will who judge them and not
treat them with sympathy and caring and
the response is not going to help
when are we going to turn up as humans
and reclaim our humanity and our
compassion and say yes if wiser can&#39;t do
this then let me at least try to be
better at the one thing that makes me
human then an artificially intelligent
