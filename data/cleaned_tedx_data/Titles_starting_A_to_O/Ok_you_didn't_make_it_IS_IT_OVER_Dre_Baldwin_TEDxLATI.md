by the age of 16 I already knew exactly
what I wanted to be when I grew up a
professional basketball player so going
into my final year of high school I knew
this would be an important launching pad
for the rest of my life so I worked
really hard on my game that summer and
by the end of my senior season all my
work and paid off by the end of that
year through 25 games all of my
teammates coaches even my opponents knew
you could count on Dre for about 20
points contribution that&#39;s not Kobe
Bryant or Steph Curry numbers but it&#39;s a
solid contribution but my 20 points
weren&#39;t my per game average I scored 20
points all season put together in total
now any reasonable logical person would
think okay kid you&#39;re going to be
successful at something but it ain&#39;t
gonna be basketball five years rated to
find the odds I wasn&#39;t counting with the
windiest on my first pro basketball
contract now if everything had gone
perfect even from that point forward I
wouldn&#39;t be standing up here today but
real life as they say tends to alter the
lab test over the next nine years of a
very up-and-down career while I did get
to see and play in places like Kaunas
Lithuania herceg novi Montenegro and
pull of Croatia
I also saw places like the stockroom of
a supermarket where I work the overnight
shift the surprisingly busy
telemarketing company you ever get those
letters in the middle to say
congratulations you&#39;re a little win ten
million dollars just doubters 1-800
number to verify your injury stuff we
throw away his junk mail well you&#39;d be
surprised how many people call also pay
for a traveling team right here in the
United States where we took eight-hour
road trips in between games riding in
what they claim to be a 15 passenger van
now I&#39;m six feet four inches tall
you can fit 15 to million one of those
vans I have a prize for you backstage
about three to four years into what I
was struggling to keep together and call
a career I realized I wasn&#39;t getting the
type of return on investment that I
wanted to get from basketball
and I needed to get more control one
thing I have been doing at that point
was publishing to this still pretty new
website called youtube.com they&#39;re on
YouTube I found an audience of athletes
who wanted to learn how to work on their
games both civic both physically and
mentally when it came to basketball and
life but looking at YouTube I ran into
the same issue I did in basketball was
that I didn&#39;t own the platform I didn&#39;t
control how things went or when I got to
do it so I needed another option at the
same time I&#39;ve been writing about my
experiences places I had been things I
was going through the good the bad and
the ugly and it was there that I ran
into the audience that led to me giving
his talk these were the athletes who
were existed in this large grey area of
professional sports where they weren&#39;t
necessarily looking for a skill help
they knew how to play they knew they
were good at what they did but at the
same time they weren&#39;t able to find jobs
they couldn&#39;t get a contract they
weren&#39;t getting a return on investment
that they expected from all the years
they put into the game my aim today is
to help any athlete any artist
struggling to sell their work any
student trying to figure out what to do
with their lives any person who&#39;s
invested a lot of time into anything to
guarantee a return on that investment
now if you think about someone taking
actions to become a professional athlete
in any sport usually by that point
they&#39;ve invested somewhere between ten
and fifteen years into the game but the
odds of anymore making it haven&#39;t
changed at all over the last 50 years
and since only so many of us can become
trainers coaches or analysts what
happens to the athlete who has put all
this time in but can&#39;t get any return on
that investment well I&#39;m an example of
what happens I&#39;ll tell you being an
assistant manager of footlocker happens
some of the gym memberships at Bally
Total Fitness happens that overnight
shift at the supermarket happens that&#39;s
how a marketing job happens in other
words you take your 15 years of
investment and you put it on the shelf
no pun intended and you go do something
else and pay the bills
the essential question I want to answer
here today is how can any person
guarantee a return a way that they can
capitalize on their experience even when
the experiences didn&#39;t go the way you
thought they would the answer is a
simple four-step process step number one
is understanding that all the bad stuff
is actually the good stuff my experience
in basketball
long story short was that I put all this
time in and I wasn&#39;t getting the return
on investment but going through those
experiences is how I picked up one and
learned my present-day expertise for
example when I first started playing
basketball there was no one around to
teach me I was 14 years old no one in
the neighborhood took me under their
wing my father&#39;s 5 foot 9 he couldn&#39;t
teach me how to play basketball I
decided that if I just went to the park
during the daytime the Philadelphia
where I&#39;m from when it&#39;s kind of too hot
in the summer for anyone to be out on
that blacktop and just practice more
than everybody else maybe I could catch
up to all the players who were ahead of
me now mind you this is the mid-90s so
there&#39;s no blogs that tells me this is
gonna work there&#39;s no YouTube video I
can use as an example this was just a
random idea
and over time it started to work for me
through that experience and many others
I learned discipline when I got out of
college and I wanted to become a
professional athlete nobody knew who I
was so I needed to go somewhere and get
myself seen I attended what we know as
an exposure camp for those you don&#39;t
know what that is think of a job fair
but it&#39;s for athletes so instead of
wearing a suit and handing out your
resume you wear a pair of sneakers and
you play your sport in front of an
audience of decision-makers agents
coaches Scouts people who can help move
you forward in your career about a few
minutes maybe three to five minutes into
the first game of that exposure camp
that I was playing in there was a
timeout and I&#39;ve been doing a whole
bunch of nothing out there on the court
now instead of listening to the coach
during the timeout I had a conversation
with myself I said Dre you invested your
last 250 dollars to come to this
exposure again you literally cannot
afford to leave here having done nothing
you need to get out there get aggressive
do something do something
it makes you stand out here because you
won&#39;t get another shot at this if you
blow this opportunity well I took my own
advice went out there played a lot
harder played a lot better and my
performance at that exposure can&#39;t
jump-started my career that experience
was the first of many to taught me
confidence now month after that exposure
camp I was back home and in the middle I
received what I had actually been
waiting for which was the game film the
footage from this exposure can and it
existed on what we knew back then is a
VHS tape I went online and I called or
emailed every pro basketball agent I
could find to try to get wanted them to
take me on as a client to represent me
to these international teams who could
possibly son well one of those agents
took me on he&#39;s the one who helped get
me to Lithuania to start my career that
experience taught me personal initiative
taking control of a situation and making
things happen instead of waiting for
them to happen now a few years after
that I just come home for the summer
from playing in Montenegro I had a brand
new agent at this time this guy had a
bigger base of clients more crowded
scenes and I had just played and I had
some new game footage now this was on a
DVD I figured all I need to do that
summer was work on my game really hard
and just sitting waiting for the phone
to ring
well August September October went by
phone didn&#39;t ring and for many years I
hated those three months out of the year
here&#39;s why that&#39;s the time of year when
professional basketball teams convene
training camp starts and you start
practicing me playing I spent too many
years during those months unsigned not
knowing when I was going to be employed
again thankfully I like those months
again but through those situations I
learned the skill of mental toughness
now what&#39;s the challenge with us looking
at the bad experiences we go through and
actually getting something out of them
I&#39;ll tell you what it is we think that
if people are going to respect us and be
impressed by us and admire us we need to
tell them about our successes our
achievements and the thing is that&#39;s
true but if you&#39;re going to help other
people and get some return
your own investment through helping
those people you need more than to
impress people see if I could sit here
and tell you stand here and tell you
that I started going to become a
professional athlete and I did it
you may respect that maybe even admire
it but 99 out of 100 people cannot
relate today but if I tell you I set a
goal to become this and despite all the
time I put into it it just wasn&#39;t giving
me the return that I thought I would get
everyone can relate to that the point
you need to take away from your bad
experiences in life is that we respect
your successes but we relate to your
failures step number 2 analysis when I
was in high school I told you I scored
20 points all season combined right
we&#39;re from a Philadelphia there&#39;s this
newspaper called the Philadelphia Daily
News after every day that there was a
high school game and we all played on
the same days the next day in the
newspaper they were print up all the
scores from the games each school and
each player on each team how many points
they scored so every day after we had a
game I was hustling to the newsstand pay
60 cents for the Philadelphia Daily News
really quick to the high school sports
section by my school look down and try
to find my name Dre Baldwin to now tells
you about my first exposure can and how
I talked myself into plan a lot better
and how that helped start my career that
wasn&#39;t the last exposure camp I went to
I went to several more and some of those
camps just based on my performance I
didn&#39;t even want the game footage now
you may wonder why even bring that up
why do I even think about it why not
just bury that and only talk about the
things that I did that we&#39;re great
understand that any experience we go
through is only valuable if you can draw
education from that experience the
simplest way to do that is ask yourself
a question why did this happen we look
at our own experiences the reason why we
often don&#39;t learn from them things that
happened in our past is because when we
fail we either start wallowing in the
emotions of failure and the reasons why
is not working or we try to bury it
suppress it move on sand
next thing and try to get back to
succeeding again and when we succeed our
egos delude us into believing that this
is just going to keep happening because
we&#39;re a divinely ordained to just win in
life this is why we don&#39;t learn much
from our past experiences if you start
asking yourself a simple question that
you can remember from this second step
why did this happen
the way that it did you&#39;ll get an answer
apply the question again why did this
happen the way that it did go deeper and
deeper into your experiences the word
analyze means to examine methodically
and in detail and the more you analyze
your situations you start to find out
formulas for why things happen and where
did they do which can be very valuable
for other people step number three it&#39;s
finding value in your experience when I
first started publishing these videos to
YouTube people would see the video me in
the gym playing basketball and they
would say man you&#39;re pretty good your
professional Hey
who do you play for well I&#39;m kind of
unemployed right now between jobs they
would say well how&#39;d you playing in
college in order to get so good to
become a pro well I actually kind of got
kicked off the basketball team as a
junior in college so I didn&#39;t do much
and they would say well Dre listen
listen I&#39;m in high school right now and
I want to become a pro so tell me how
many points that you score in high
school in order to get to the point that
you could become a professional how many
points that&#39;s good not enough now you
may think me telling these these things
to these people asking me these
questions telling them the truth might
have turned him off to me maybe they
would have said well why do I even need
to listen to this guy he&#39;s an unemployed
basketball player he didn&#39;t even play
his last year-and-a-half in college he
sat on a bench all four years he was in
high school one year he was on the team
in high school this guy&#39;s been failing
his whole career what do I need to learn
from this guy well let me tell you what
actually happened when I started sharing
those truths with people I started
receiving all types of messages diems
emails from people who would say to me
Dre I really appreciate you sharing your
story with us because you&#39;re giving me
hope
you&#39;re representing an example to me
that it is possible it can happen
because you know what Dre I&#39;m in high
school right now and I&#39;m sitting on the
end of the bench I graduated college
three years ago and I don&#39;t know how to
start my career someone told me a long
time ago did it was too late for me to
make it in basketball but hearing from
you gives me hope to know that it&#39;s
still possible how you get value from
your experiences that you have to
sharpen your skill of observation how
you do this is very simple everything
you go through ask yourself this
question if I had to teach a class on it
I had to give a 15-minute presentation
on it I had to make a ten minute video
on the topic what would be to take away
what do I want people to get from it yes
even the worst things that you go
through this sharpens your skill of
observation not just of what&#39;s happening
outside of and around you but also
what&#39;s happening internally why did I
think this why do I feel this way why
did I make that decision and even though
you&#39;ve already been through the
experience this can be super valuable to
the people who are coming behind you now
step number four we&#39;ve looked at all our
good and bad experiences step one
analyze everything that happened and
extracted the value from it but how do
you put all this together how do you
make this into something real and
something tangible step number four is
speaking up as an entrepreneur these
days I had many conversations with I
guess we call them once you&#39;re enormous
people who want to do things they want
to get on stage and be a public speaker
write a book start blogging make videos
and post them online but they&#39;re not
doing it and when they start telling me
about these things I ask the obvious
question that you may be thinking what&#39;s
stopping you why aren&#39;t you doing it why
haven&#39;t you begun the answer is usually
some form of the following I&#39;m not good
enough I haven&#39;t done enough I don&#39;t
know enough I&#39;m not as good as this
person over here who&#39;s been doing it for
15 years before I even got involved
understand that that&#39;s the point you
were the only person on this planet who
has experienced your exact experience
there&#39;s no one else out there who can
tell your story better than you no one
else out there you can tell you
story period and when you start speaking
up telling the world where you&#39;ve been
what you&#39;ve been through and what you&#39;re
dealing with your perfect audience will
select themselves these are the people
who are right now sitting in the seat
that you sat in six weeks ago eight
months ago and ten years ago they&#39;re
gonna seek you up and when they come to
you for help help them out and when they
keep coming back it&#39;s awesome for it in
conclusion for all the athletes the
artists students anyone who&#39;s heavily
invested into anything you&#39;ve done in
your life and you haven&#39;t quite gotten
the return on investment that you expect
it to this point
understand that life is working for you
even when it seems to not be working
start seeing every experience you go
through as material and stop waiting for
things to work in your favor
waiting for things to work for you in
life is kind of like shooting a
half-court shot in basketball where it
might go in there&#39;s a good chance it
doesn&#39;t even come close I challenge you
here today so look at all your
experiences both the good and especially
the bad go deep and analyze everything
that happened and why it happened
extract the value from all those
experiences speak up about where you&#39;ve
been and what you&#39;ve been through and
turn that half-court shot into a layup
thank you
