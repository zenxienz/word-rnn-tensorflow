it&#39;s working good evening ladies
gentlemen I&#39;m very fortunate to come
from a very far land cauldron in
Slovenia even if it&#39;s 20 kilometers it&#39;s
quite far so but I am very happy to be
the part of this equal part has the
audience I&#39;m not considering myself as a
speaker because I&#39;m not special maybe
with some special needs but have not
special because everybody made by the
nature is equal so I&#39;m very fortunate to
be part of equal you
thanks to Natalia I hope she spoke some
something good about me and I could
understand a bit but I don&#39;t remember
when was the last time somebody spoke so
many good things at once about me so
thank you
also I am very much energised by by by
knowing this fact sorry by knowing this
fact that which is which is a very great
fact that madam first lady of the United
States of America belongs to this lovely
town it is it is an honor for the
country I&#39;m sure that many people think
the way I do so I&#39;m very fortunate to be
in this city as I said my name is mixed
up as as it&#39;s even written behind me
this very simple name found very common
in India gave me a hard time
why this very name when just imagine
somebody is asking your name and you are
you are you&#39;re frozen you you stuck at a
point so this math table name was quite
hard for me to speak because I stammer
those of you who do not know what
stammering is it is
some kind of speech impediment I would
like if somebody from the audience&#39;s a
girl probably is having a name from
Keita
is is there some girl having a name from
K in the audience okay let&#39;s say gosh co
if not a girl so if I had to say gosh co
or kya I would say hi uh kya that was
the problem and if somebody&#39;s going to
ask my name it was a nightmare I would
sweat I would I would freeze I wouldn&#39;t
meet the guests who were coming to my
home I would not even speak to the
fellow students and in my class I was
not the dumbest one but certainly I was
an average and I knew answers to many
questions my teachers would ask but this
speech impediment stopped me I would
raise my hand and when it was a time to
say the answer I would freeze and
eventually I didn&#39;t raise my hand so
that was the the problem with me so one
day I just spoke to myself look man you
need to get yourself you know together
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not something which I
mean I was having nightmares at the age
of six or seven or onwards you know and
then I suddenly I realized look I&#39;m not
going to give up because I&#39;m a man who
has a great history our countries and
religious history is quite a strong one
so I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m the generation coming
from that powerful boiling blood and I
should not give up just on this little
stammering problem so I got myself up I
went to England at the age of 17 all
alone we did not have even still we do
not have any relatives or friends and
family over there so while coming out
from the Heathrow Airport I didn&#39;t know
that who is going to pick me up because
my father fixed some some something so
then I I stood up I was under constant
surveillance for a couple of months
couple of years
and I spoke to myself that I need to
talk there was so much I mean just
imagine the guy who is 17 he couldn&#39;t
even speak his name and there is so much
of death ha you know so many of I mean
so many childhood memories I was bullied
I was bullied by my friends bullied by
my neighbors bullied by my own family
the direct first blood family my school
teachers I mean there was not only I
mean because this is not considered as a
speech impediment this is something
considered in India sadly that you do it
on purpose so they were like oh my god
you&#39;re just trying to create some funny
environment but inside me there was a
boiling blood I thank God I didn&#39;t have
any kalashnikova at that time I would be
a murderer by now so yes I went to
England I just took my myself up and
then I said okay I&#39;m gonna do it so
because there were so many dreams I was
holding in my head I like to dream and
to be very honest I would just share
this in front of your audience I like to
talk to myself it could be considered as
a as a psychological imbalance but yes I
like to talk to myself even though it is
it looks we&#39;re just imagine one guy
sitting and eating and talking to
himself you know it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a weird
thing to witness but I do it and I do it
with the great pride because that tells
me that helps me to understand where I
need to go I don&#39;t want to die but I
have to sadly I have to
why not because I would like to live and
I would like to see 2500 year or
something no not because of that because
there are so many things pending in the
world in my country in your country
around the world there are so many
pending things in the world which we
need to fix because I sadly consider
that if not me then nobody if I won&#39;t
take an action for myself nobody else is
going to take an action for me nobody
from
Uganda nobody from China is going to
tell to me hey meth table you need to
gather yourself so I took a decision I
helped myself I woke up I said okay
either dreams or stammering I chose my
dreams
I&#39;d like to dream and I took so many
affections I was traveling I&#39;m a
worldwide traveler I have seen a lot of
countries in my life and I chose and I
was traveling to Sylvania once and I I
said to myself okay this is the land
this is the land I would like to live in
so I congratulate you all of you who
have been very lucky to get birth in
this country not every country is as
beautiful paradise as you people own I
mean it is part of your life you own a
bit of country from the map you know so
you are lucky to be here then I came to
Selenia I established my business I
didn&#39;t know what to do I have slept on
floor I have slept hungry I at some
point I didn&#39;t even have a shower but I
didn&#39;t give up there is no such thing in
my life giving up I mean I have been
into great mess with my friends but I&#39;m
the last one to leave to leave the stage
probably 16 minutes won&#39;t be enough if
they will have to drag me out so um I
don&#39;t give up I just said to myself I&#39;m
not gonna give up and then instalay Nia
I found myself I&#39;m very lucky that part
of my youth 20s and part of my 30s are
going to be in this country because then
I go back to India after two years
hopefully please wish me good luck that
I go back to India because there are so
many pending things so many pending
things in this country as I said in in
in the wider world I would like to see
those people who have been looking high
towards me who have been looking all the
way their hopes are my hopes I I chose I
mean what are my hopes their hopes
hopes so I am fortunate enough to think
that that I&#39;m going to fulfill their
dreams because I don&#39;t have a dream of
my own my personal self has has actually
vanished I&#39;m so glad that my personal
self is is I mean does not exist anymore
so I am going to serve the people of my
land and wherever I stand is my land you
know this is my land because the entire
world is our world and and I always tell
the people consider this earth as a
single unit people who are fighting wars
between the countries or doing a lot of
things they have failed to understand
that earth is a single unit a couple of
years back probably there was a there
was a they were a scuffle going on
between Israel and Palestine and in Gaza
is the main reason I mentioned on my
Facebook I went early in the morning on
my Facebook account and I use Facebook
for good things actually which is which
is quite quite a rare thing these days I
went onto my facebook I wrote oh my god
I just realized that Gaza and Israel are
not very far from where I live
they&#39;re on the same planet so we have to
understand that this is one unit one
life one self we need to take action if
we do not have dreams on somebody else&#39;s
dream there are hundreds of people
starving dying on so many fronts we need
to get up for those by killing your
dreams is not the case but changing your
dream because we have everything I have
two limbs I mean two arms at your four
limbs two arms two legs I can talk now
and I can I can even try to convince the
people I have money for myself but there
has to be a satisfaction for self but
not a satisfaction for the others I&#39;m
not satisfied by my reserve
by my effort towards the people but I&#39;m
satisfied by my effort towards myself so
now it&#39;s time to go on because there are
so many so many souls not only bodies so
many souls looking high towards us and
we need to stand up for them probably
I&#39;m also addressing not only the group
which has just come to this grad the
castle I&#39;m also of addressing people
worldwide on the internet the wider
world so we need to understand that we
have have have only one one chance you
know to do sort this thing but I I would
like to mention that I am I am I mean
you have a very clean country those of
you who do not realize that just go for
a trip for a week and come back you get
out of Bernake and you&#39;re like wow where
am I
so you have a very clean country I think
this one thing should be learned by the
world from you guys I mean how to
maintain but this thing should be
maintained further I mean our
forefathers have done a great job for us
now it&#39;s our job because we will be the
forefathers of some somebody else as
well so to preserve the country also
politically also many people say oh
don&#39;t talk about government on TEDx but
government is part of the body you know
I mean I am a legal person as well I&#39;m a
person but I&#39;m I&#39;m subject to the law
I&#39;m subject to the your your
constitution so we need to preserve it
I&#39;m very thankful again to the
government&#39;s Lena being one of the first
countries in the world to consider to
accept water as a constitutional right
so Bravo I mean it is it is it is a
great thing but much has to be done and
and then we need to help ourselves by
getting up if we have any idea if we
have any dream generally people say ok
everyone is talking about dreaming ideas
if we dream then what what next will
happen how to achieve them write them on
a piece of paper take the consultation
when you consult someone so you have to
be firm with your dream one thing is
that you have to be firm with your dream
it should not okay the way could be
flexible to achieve it but having a
dream is very important and then ask
people&#39;s advice be and that&#39;s the real
test for the people for your friends so
if somebody&#39;s just trying to say oh come
on go come on you won&#39;t make a change
go away leave them I have left many
because I would like to go forward leave
them and from that point you will come
to know oh who is who is my my like mind
person so achieve them
okay I mean help I mean ask their help
get on to the point because if we know
what to do we know how to do if I know
okay that girl over there okay I would
like to talk to her you know so I should
know how to talk to her you know maybe I
could have somebody somebody&#39;s held an
experienced person but he would say okay
look man
walk straight don&#39;t do like this go
gently approach her and talk to her you
know so this is the way if you know what
to do you know how to do but you always
can take an advice so and once you are
there then you have a filter of choosing
whom you want to let close or not you
know relieve them there are many people
because universe seeking the seeker you
know the one who seeks what I seek is
actually seeking me it&#39;s a law of nature
what I want that thing is also wanting
me so the one I seek is actually seeking
me so we have to understand this thing
and get on to your boots sleep only a
few hours a day it&#39;s enough I know I was
sleeping few hours a day but now I&#39;m I
love sleeping sleeping is my hobby very
new hobby and also mountaineering is my
hobby my friend is sitting over here
mountaineering Selenia has given me what
a very nice life very nice people
very nice food to eat healthy food to
eat and one thing mountaineering
Slovenia has given you mountaineering we
did six peaks in core in a project
called Triglav but we couldn&#39;t go to
Triglav because of rain last weekend but
we got up we went onto the foothill and
we took some videos and and we did it so
at the end I would like to mention the
the national anthem of your country it&#39;s
the only anthem I have read which says
good about everyone god save the queen&#39;
indian anthem says about themselves the
Slovene anthem is the only anthem I have
read which says also good about the
neighbours are good to all the nations
so let&#39;s get up and hopefully we change
the world to a better place and let&#39;s
make life taste better thank you so much
[Applause]
