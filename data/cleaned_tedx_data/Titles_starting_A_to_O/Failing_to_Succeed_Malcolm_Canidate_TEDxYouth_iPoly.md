you
hey good evening everyone
um so yes mr. Weston my name is Malcolm
candidate and I just like the start and
reference this presentation with a
question how many of you have ever
failed in anything that you&#39;ve ever
tried to do alright so you know we we do
these things these things called
make goals and we try to have these
goals that we make we oftentimes set
these achievements
ahead of ourselves as milestones or
things that we want to accomplish going
forward in life and when we have these
specific you know achievements or
milestones we try to reach we hope that
that can you know lead to more
accomplishment
then failure now the questions are not
posed to you is just just to see how
many of you actually thought that you
failed at something but by the end of
this presentation I hope to change your
mind on what failure actually is because
typically we see failure is such a bad
thing as a sting of being synonymous
with a lesser of something that we
should frown upon at all times that we
should not you know be proud of failures
but without failure how would you know
how to get better I get the next line
for me so I&#39;ll start with a quote by one
of my favorite people on the planet and
probably the greatest basketball player
to ever live Michael Jordan I missed
more than 9,000 shots no 3000 excuse me
lost over 900 games 26 times I&#39;ve been
trusted to take the game-winning shot
and I missed I failed
over and over and over again in my life
and that is why I succeed you know this
this quote really inspired me because
you know I think Michael Jordan in the
first thing
my mind is oh the man has six rings he
has multiple MVP awards and you have to
wonder yourself how can this great
basketball player be Sony used to
failing and then you know I brought that
tomorrow something I had to ask the
question how can I be okay with failure
can I get the next slide please ask
myself why is failure so fine apart
because of these three things one is
because it&#39;s synonymous with the lesser
we tend to think that if you fail but
you&#39;re just not you&#39;re not up to par
that you&#39;re just not that type of person
that I&#39;m going to seek out to do these
next things to do these great things
that you know we see all these other
great people do because we only see
great people succeed then we have an
obsession with being the best we always
have to be the top market we have to be
the number one because if we&#39;re not the
number one then we look at ourselves as
being bad and other CEO says you know if
we see my dad has a saying it&#39;s like if
you&#39;re not number one two is not a
winner and three nobody remembers you
know I kind of to myself that was kind
of a motivator for a while but then I
understood that you know you have to
experience you cannot be number one all
the time and then you have this expert
expectation of perfection then it just
wonders to yourself that you&#39;re just
like everything that you have to do at
every point in time in your life any
achievement that you want that you want
to get it as best as you and it has to
be you know 100 percent go the way that
you want and how it planned out in your
mind the thing you wanted to yourself
how can that happen next slide please so
then ask myself what is failure
typically failure we associate with like
I said it before not being on top so
we&#39;re let&#39;s I&#39;ll use the example of
running a marathon your goal is to run a
marathon to be in first and you&#39;ve come
in a second you still completed the goal
of running a marathon so your goal was
accomplished but the aspiration that you
had
to be number one that was a mistake I
was not a failure because you did not
fail to complete the marathon so we look
at ourselves as you know failing at
these things but then we just mistake
mistakes for failures when the mistakes
that we made are stepping stones that we
should be using to move us to the next
level and they should be guiding points
to get us to that next level to reach
the success that we so greatly desire
and so you know I just look at you know
like I referenced earlier in the you
know we have media people and there was
a commercial that I saw they kind of
inspired me I wish I could show it
tonight but for technical difficulties
I&#39;m just going to you know just give you
the gist of it it was basically saying
what is the key to victory then you have
Michael Jordan go role on the screen and
he says not making your high school
varsity team then you have Serena
Williams greatest female tennis player
ever she comes out and says being on the
wrong side of the greatest upset in your
sport then you have Matt Ryan who MVP of
the NFL last year and he comes in has a
20-point lead on the Patriots and loses
the game and you have to wonder in
yourself what is the key to victory if
all of these are showing mistakes and
failures
that&#39;s the key Nikita the key to success
is defeat you have to understand that
you have to fail in order to success in
order to succeed give me next one so
then I looked at my own life and I think
back on that lettings back in eighth
grade it was my first year playing
football they were I&#39;ve never played
football in my life the coaches bring me
in they asked me to play quarterback
running back wide receiver middle
linebacker I had no prior knowledge of
these positions in playing them on the
field I had just witnessed them
we go in we saw we had a lot of young
talent I was better than any other
player
that field on my team when we come out
in that first game we lose okay but then
we go to our third game fast forward I&#39;m
trying to do my best to help my team and
halftime everything&#39;s looking great
we&#39;re up 20 to nothing we&#39;re doing great
there&#39;s something kicks at halftime
other team figures out they have the
ingredients to beat us they come out
they draw together one school to score
it&#39;s 14 to 20 then they come back tie it
up 20 to 20
it&#39;s the last play of the game I have
the ball in my hand coaches looking at
me saying it&#39;s time for you to make a
play throw the ball gets intercepted ran
back for a touchdown
they win the game 26 to 20 its
heartbroken cried all the way home
wanted to quit sport I told my mom and
dad I&#39;m never playing another sport
again 5 4 1 2 academics in 9th grade I
was so ahead of myself thinking that I
could just you know go up on myself and
just do whatever it I need to do just go
with my classes do whatever I needed I
don&#39;t have to study all the teacher has
to do is teach me the subject material I
absorb it test comes I sit no studying
is involved that&#39;s just me because I did
that in grades k-8 because that&#39;s all
that was expected of me regurgitate the
knowledge that you were giving of me I
come in my first semester of ninth grade
year I had three B&#39;s on my report card
and I looked at that as a failure
because my mom and dad they were you
know they were sunny you know you should
have tried harder you should have
studied me that was a fan and I was so
used to smiling in my teachers faces and
just you know walking up to these
teachers and saying oh hi mr. song so hi
mr. so-and-so how are you doing today
how was your day I was so used to
smiling with my teachers having a
relationship built up I&#39;ve forgotten the
whole point of going to school was to
learn the material fast forward to my
ninth grade year again ninth grade year
my first song that I ever produced I
thought it was the greatest song ever
just gotten opportunity to use my math
teachers mic and I just got my laptop I
was like okay got the beat let&#39;s go
let&#39;s drop it recorded it quality was
terrible now that I&#39;m up there enough to
see but I was so happy I was so proud so
I go and I play it on our radio show I
thought it was the most greatest thing
ever and then I go talk to my friends
they&#39;re like oh girl you did amazing two
weeks later my friend comes up to me
laughing is behind us I&#39;m like oh what&#39;s
up he shows me a screenshot of a Twitter
page of SoCal confessions the caption
read when a freshman holds the entire
school hostage and plays his mixtape it
had 900 retweets
we don&#39;t have 900 kids at our school I
was devastated I didn&#39;t know what to do
I was just like how is this how am I
supposed to recover so I could have
given up everything that I loved right
there but luckily I had people on my
path such as the mr. West such as a mr.
Australia who is our math teacher
such as all these different peoples my
mom my dad who told me you need to look
at these things as mistakes then you
stop and you don&#39;t you don&#39;t get better
eighth grade year athletics we come back
the very next game that the team that we
just played instead of focusing on
myself I focused on the other guys
around me made them play better we came
back and won that game 35 to 19 that was
the only one we had that fever but we
still were happy because I was the only
thought and that was the only thing that
we remembered because we came back and
we did not give up we said we were going
to win at least one game and we brought
it all together and we did it fast over
to academics and that grade I had some
of the same features at ninth grade that
I had my junior year so I came back I&#39;m
saying okay so I&#39;m presented with this
challenge
I need to do better instead of making a
relationship and trying to smile my way
through my grades I need to actually
study and I need to apply myself use my
failures as a stepping-stone to get
better and then I came out I transformed
my grades to four B&#39;s - for A&#39;s and it
was that growth from an 86 in matter to
a 96 in math with no help it was just
only using my intuition learning from
the mistakes that I made fast forward to
the music I now have three albums that I
have produced myself and released and I
am proud of it because I have made the
music for me and I made the music for
someone else and it was that fire that
was lit unto me by the ridicule that I
received from people with Jared my music
from making something great and making
something better that I could be proud
of and that is the whole key to success
the whole point of success is to
recognize your failures are yours to
make and they&#39;re your mistakes not
predicated upon what someone else
believes because we get this
preconceived ideas of our success is
based off someone else&#39;s beliefs then
that&#39;s when we fail because you cannot
please everyone else around you the goal
is to please yourself until you are
satisfied and when you make the goal
that you are satisfied in reaching that
is when you can say you have made the
ultimate success because then no one can
take that away from you and that is to
the point where stories like mine you
understand that is just where it comes
one of the greatest innovators mr. Bill
Gates instead it&#39;s fine to celebrate
your successes but it&#39;s more important
to hear the lessons of failure and that
just says embrace your failures embrace
your mistakes embrace the things that
you call impurities and understand that
without those impurities without those
failures you cannot get better because
no teacher is greater to yourself than
you are and understanding that no one
else&#39;s experiences you can teach you
better
again thank you very much
[Applause]
