to be quite frank it&#39;s very I&#39;ve found
myself very lucky to share this stage
with all the other noble people here
like most of you I grew up watching TED
Talks being inspired by them me being
motivated by them so it&#39;s quite an honor
for me to be here honestly I wasn&#39;t sure
what&#39;s so special about me I&#39;m probably
just a few years older to you but
probably someone in the management
thought that this crazy lady has taken a
lot of Uncharted decisions in her life
and she would share a thing or two with
you with you people here so that got me
to think that what are the decisions
that I have taken in my 20s that could
be considered different from my friends
or my colleagues or my fellows students
who graduated with me and I shortlisted
it to down to three decisions the first
decision was to go get an MBA from a
foreign country now for me it ended up
being an MBA because I was doing a
business degree for you it&#39;s going to be
something else and at the time when I
applied for Fulbright scholarship and
got rejected at least twice or thrice I
kept on relentlessly pursuing this and I
thought it was normal I thought most of
you would have dreams to go outside and
study why not but when I look at
statistics I saw that from my own
University out of a batch of two or
three hundred girls only two or three
went to pursue a foreign degree I don&#39;t
know why but I really hope for all the
girls who are sitting here you&#39;re not
going to let fear to make that decision
for you because for me to go out set in
a different culture it was so exciting I
learned so much and it&#39;s an experience
that I would want for all of you to have
to go outside in to a different culture
it could be Iran you Becca Stein Germany
for me it was the United States but I
believe that you will learn so much with
a clash of different ideologies speaking
to people from different religions
different culture it&#39;s experience it&#39;s a
must have experience the second decision
that I took when I came back was to be
an entrepreneur now I was 27 years old
when I came back
and much to the opinion of a lot of
auntie&#39;s who thought that I have passed
my prime age to get married I&#39;m sure
most of the girls here would understand
it&#39;s I think 20 to 23 years that&#39;s a
prime age and but when I came back
instead of thinking about marriage I
decided to make an even crazier decision
and to go into a business and that too
in tech field now I don&#39;t have a degree
in technology I so happened to get a
co-founder who was in technology
business and I am now developing
strategies for my tech company so that&#39;s
the second decision that I made that I
thought that I have learnt so much what
else can i contribute to my society
besides in addition to being married and
having a family what can I as a woman
contribute to the betterment of my
country the third decision as you will
see that these circles get even bigger
and bigger because I think they get even
crazier is the vision that I have for my
company called mystique can you move to
the next slide the vision for this
company is to put Pakistan on the global
trade map now for you either if you&#39;re a
buyer or a seller what we&#39;re doing is we
are solving three problems with the help
of technology we&#39;re solving the problem
of international logistics international
payments and customs clearance and the
reason why I wanted to do that I feel
that as a country we&#39;ve been isolated
especially from the global trade map and
I thought that there are Pakistan has a
huge potential for export I I learned
this during my business degree that if
companies like mango and Zara can
outsource their manufacturing units here
in Pakistan then that means we have the
capability to produce world-class
products but somehow we&#39;re losing out on
developing a brand
so what Pakistan what happens to
Pakistan is that we lose out on two
things we lose on lose out on the
financial gains that are associated with
a global brand
second I want Pakistan to be known for
other things besides terrorism
I want Pakistan to be known for cricket
for food for like the great potential
that we have to build great businesses
so I will tell you a little bit about
this platform so it&#39;s called nest egg
it&#39;s integrated with Amazon right now we
have it set it up we&#39;ve set it up for
import and
working on export so what you do is in
the search bar you write what you want
to buy can I move on to the next slide
we have integrated this with Amazon
Amazon is the number one ecommerce
player in America you select what you
want to buy and when you checkout you go
on to the third slide where our
algorithm calculates the final price in
PKR so what you do is take care of
international delivery for you we you
can pay us in cash and we take care of
customs clearance now if you want to
sell on a global platform we saw the
same three problems for you and I think
in sharra this will really help build
more prosperity in Pakistan it is really
going to help especially the small
medium businesses who want to sell on a
global platform it will help in income
distribution within our country and
what&#39;s happened is this is the motor
from my MBA Thunderbird school of global
management recently my vision has become
even crazier and I think if you read
this that says borders frequented by
trade seldom need soldiers I think
there&#39;s a great truth to it
I think each and every one of us here
there&#39;s so much that we can do not only
for our country but for the whole world
we can start even dreaming about it
because dreaming is fun you can forget
about the consequences you can forget
about how will it happen but honestly
like for all of these decisions they
ended up I ended up taking them but
before that what was important was that
I was dreaming about them that I was at
least thinking about them just to
snippets that I&#39;ve learned from my for
my entrepreneurial journey first is
easier said than done but honestly when
I wake up every day and I have of course
so many challenges to face with customs
and everything what keeps me going
is that I&#39;m following my dream and I am
pretty sure money is going to soon
follow the second is there is the right
time to start to follow your dreams
either it is to be an entrepreneur or
you want to be an athlete or whatever
it&#39;s I I feel it&#39;s right now and you can
see that colonal Sanders who was the
founder of KFC
can you guess what age was he when he
began his business
he was 64 years old when he started KFC
and but you have also Warren Buffet who
started when he was 9 years old so I
don&#39;t think there&#39;s a right age but I do
think the right time for you to start
dreaming about at least going to
uncharted waters is right now thank you
so much
