June 1998 on a beautiful Saturday

morning at 8:00 a.m. I pulled into the
parking lot of the pharmacy where I was
working as the relief pharmacist for the
day immediately I noticed several cars
in the parking lot oh it made me nervous
for a moment I thought oh my god I must
be late
I wasn&#39;t forty five minutes later after
prepping shop and opening the doors
first patient walks in steps up to the
counter hands me a script for oxycontin
second patient follows hands me a script
for oxycontin third patient walks up and
hands me a script for oxycontin for the
last decade we have been in the midst of
the worst drug epidemic in American
history
worse than the heroin epidemic of the
70s the AIDS epidemic of that in 80s and
the crack cocaine epidemic of the 90s
I&#39;m speaking about the opioid or
prescription painkiller epidemic for the
first time ever drug overdoses are the
number one cause of death in Americans
under 50 under 50 you&#39;re in your prime
and by the time I&#39;m done speaking today
one person will have died yes every 15
minutes we lose a life do an opioid
overdose and by the same time tomorrow
24 hours from now 96 people will have
died with these odds it&#39;s likely in your
proximity isn&#39;t your brother your child
your neighbor your best friend
it could even be you and if you don&#39;t
believe that you&#39;re being touched by it
you will be guaranteed this is just like
cancer it&#39;s touching all of us here&#39;s
why this is important to me I play many
roles mother of five leadership results
coach clinical pharmacist before
graduating I was selected for a
prestigious internship for
pharmaceutical company it gave me a rare
advantage an insider&#39;s view and after
graduating from USC go Trojans
with a doctor of pharmacy degree
followed by a clinical residency I
accepted a position as a clinical
pharmacist in a hospital but I also
chose to work weekends retail to
experience that side of pharmacy and
back in the 90s we pharmacist myself
included were filling oxycontin and
vicodin pills like candy without any red
flags it was the norm in fact we would
have a large talk bottle right in front
of us on the counter for fast moving
refills and our actions were saying it&#39;s
not even worth taking the time and
turning around and putting that bottle
back on the shelf the volume was that
high but what brings me here to you
today is for the last two years I have
been hanging out in prisons it started
with a letter from an inmate humbly
requesting one public speaking manual
and a club sponsor I promptly replied to
the letter invited a group of friends to
join me and on the day that we showed up
having never been in a prison before and
after clearing security we walked into a
large room full of men and we were met
with a standing ovation so I am now my
newest role is I&#39;m a mentor for
prisoners in the Florida Department of
Corrections I&#39;m behind bars six days a
week and it&#39;s what I learned behind
those bars the deeper personal stories
and problems that caused me to want to
engage you to go to the source consider
this metaphor one summer you and a group
of friends are enjoying the picnic you
notice a baby in the river
crying instinctively you rush to save
the baby then there&#39;s a second baby
screaming and you pull that baby out too
and now there are more and more babies
coming down the river and you and your
friends are pulling them out as fast as
you can exhausted a few of you think hey
we need to go upstream and stop whoever
is throwing them in if you want to make
a difference
go to the source go to the root cause
go upstream but before we go upstream
let me take you on a journey downstream
and for that we have to go way back to
1898 when heroin and opioid was
considered a wonder drug
but as physicians started to become
aware of the addictive nature of opioids
and tried to avoid using them what we
see is by 1924 heroin is illegal let&#39;s
fast-forward to the 80s the attitude
begins to change why one short article
in a reputable journal is published
regarding the non addictive nature of
opioids and that fuels the epidemic
everyone is referencing it let&#39;s move to
the 90s pain management becomes a hot
topic and the addictive nature of
opioids they&#39;re downplayed they&#39;re
minimized we also see this brilliant
marketing campaign and we pick up a
fifth vital sign pain when you go to see
a physician they&#39;re gonna check your
blood pressure your respiration rate
your pulse your temperature well now we
added what is your pain on a scale of
zero to ten zero should have never been
a goal it&#39;s not realistic 1996 Purdue
Pharma introduces oxycontin and in one
year from 1995 to 1996 prescriptions
jumped by eight million and for the next
ten years we see the most aggressive
marketing campaign including videos for
doctor&#39;s waiting rooms ads in reputable
journals this huge marketing team and as
sales continue to skyrocket
stay with me 2007 Purdue Pharma pleads
guilty to criminal charges for
misleading the government the medical
community and the public regarding the
risks of oxycontin addiction and abuse
they pay more than six hundred million
dollars in penalties sounds like a lot
of money for most of us it is for the
company it was the cost of doing
yes annual revenues of more than three
billion dollars a year 2015
enough opioids are prescribed for every
adult in the country and now here we are
near the end of 2017 using today&#39;s
modern lingo hashtag opioid crisis so
let&#39;s move down and let&#39;s look at how we
define addiction do you believe
addiction is a lack of character and
morals or do you believe addiction is an
illness let&#39;s take a look we can look at
her and say loser scumbag druggie go get
a life we need to be saying deep pain
hopelessness hurting she needs help
addiction means to be enslaved to you&#39;re
under the influence of a drug that
causes you not to have the ability to
care research shows that the neuro
pathways of the brain begin to change we
must begin to understand addiction as a
brain illness and not a mental illness
which stigmatize the disease just like
we don&#39;t stigmatize cancer and
furthermore addiction in itself is not a
criminal act the same cannot be said for
those pharmaceutical companies that
misled everyone that their drugs were
safe all the mentoring of incarcerated
men and women has been a lesson to me
when they open up and they share their
personal stories that has been a lesson
to me and the theme is consistently it&#39;s
a lack of love a lack of connection a
lack of being valued see pain is real
in keeping with juda met pain away is a
legitimate goal but we have to
understand that there are other ways to
deal pain and we can no longer be this
pill will fix it society
and we must surrender this notion that
we must live with a zero level of pain
here&#39;s what I&#39;m saying if I take my
education of the pharmacist my passion
for leadership and my mentoring of
inmates what is crystal clear is the
opioid epidemic is a symptom of a much
deeper epidemic it&#39;s the pain beneath
the pain it&#39;s the pain of despair
loneliness depression it&#39;s the pain of
lack of purpose like a faith lack of
love this is emotional pain it comes
from devaluing humans I received a note
from a former inmate and what he said to
me was remarkable
this emotional pain cannot be relieved
with a chemical substance it takes human
involvement when a person is valued and
surrounded by love when he knows he&#39;s
not alone he is able to deal with his
pain your love your compassion your
concern saved me so how do we go
upstream how do we go to the source
there are lots of great projects all
across the country dealing with the
opioid epidemic as a symptom including
prescription drug monitoring programs
medical assisted treatment community
collaboration and the list goes on but
what can we do to go upstream and stop
the babies from being thrown in I have
come to believe that the answers are not
in the medical journals but in the
leadership journals we as a society rely
too much on pills and not enough on
people our human need of significance
love and connection can never be met
with chemicals there is something wrong
going on here simply focusing on opioids
makes no sense
we not need to only cut the supply we
need to cut the demand and for that I
would like to propose three simple
action steps a first step
it can be done today take your eyes off
your screens and began to build human
connections where have we learned that
how often do we ignore people as simple
hello a second step let&#39;s begin to new
addicts with empathy not as a drain
society and if embarrassment to our
community and a third step let&#39;s begin
to spearhead a culture of caring a focus
on service and mentoring I have a
confession to make remember all those
patients that waited nearly an hour to
get their meds I was one of those people
without the empathy the prisoner has
changed this pharmacist mind on how to
deal with this epidemic and none of this
can happen until we realize we are not
different we are the same we need to let
go of this culture of the instant in the
culture of disinterest in the culture of
strangers this is preventable and
treatable we&#39;re not only looking for
licensed professionals we are looking
for ordinary people who care every day
people who care this is not a new
message it&#39;s a message that&#39;s not giving
any airtime
remember our metaphor the river is the
epidemic the babies are the addicts you
and your friends your midstream the
solution can be found upstream
upstream is to empathize not stigmatize
upstream is to humanize not criminalize
an upstream is to build community not
apathy we are the people that can save
lives
let&#39;s go upstream and stop the babies
from being thrown em
thank you
[Applause]
