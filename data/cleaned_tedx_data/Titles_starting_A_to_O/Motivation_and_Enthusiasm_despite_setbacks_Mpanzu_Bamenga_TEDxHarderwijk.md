my name is ponzu ba manga I&#39;m 32 years
old
I&#39;m born in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo
I was named by my grandfather
his name was from Council which means
fighter of the people when I was young
just a baby I had my first fight and
guess what it was a fight with my bike I
had a tricycle given to me by my parents
because I was still a child but I had a
brother it was a little bit of bullying
back then and he was six years older and
my brother you know what he did because
he didn&#39;t have a bike he removed both
wheels and made a tricycle he made it a
bicycle so right now I didn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t
body crying mom mom look what my brother
did to hold me and she said son if you
want something use everything you got
and go for it and I asked her what do
you mean use everything that I got how
will I know what I got well by just
doing it having the courage to fall and
stand up that&#39;s how you do it so I took
the bike again started biking now biking
again fell down but eventually
eventually I learned how to bike and
that moment that feeling was fantastic
but you said
it was like a victory to me a few years
later my mother came to Europe together
with my sister my brother and I because
she wanted a better future for us my
sister stayed in France and me my
brother and my mother we came to the
Netherlands when we came here my mother
applied for asylum and was she applied
for asylum this was denied it was
rejected so we stayed as illegal
migrants here the Netherlands for a very
very long time in that period who
couldn&#39;t work poon study we couldn&#39;t
travel our future was very insecure we
didn&#39;t know what tomorrow will bring but
still we had hope hope of a better
tomorrow we had hope and we had to faith
that everything will be okay we had
friends surrounding us loving us and
that felt very good till that day I
still can remember it when we received
the letter it was a letter stating that
we need to leave the country within
eight weeks we were devastated
devastated we didn&#39;t know
we were afraid to be to the country and
that moment actually for the first time
I felt like the love was gone
wrote a song I wrote a song and the song
goes like this
my dreams are blown I no longer want to
carry on my life is hard I&#39;m stepping on
the danger zone but that&#39;s the man I
gotta handle the struggle do what I got
a Dubai don&#39;t reach for a battle my
trouble started building up I no longer
wanna cry no mo coz I&#39;m stuck in the
corner ain&#39;t no option I&#39;m heading one
direction I got to survive hustle or die
so I cash up not a part of growing up is
a hard one we lose him compassion man
look how we use guns
it&#39;s funny how we spending money to the
wrong course affording them automatic
guns but can&#39;t feed the pores they treat
us like shit even shit gets better
treatments for real I&#39;m exhausted
I&#39;m trapped the risk of death no longer
hold me back coz when the love is gone
you go crazy step by step I didn&#39;t know
I didn&#39;t want leave the country because
I had my friends I had my school I was
studying law
I had my future over here but I was
asking myself what can I do what can I
do to change this decision that we have
to leave within eight weeks and then
suddenly I remember what my mother told
me if you want something don&#39;t cry use
everything you got and go for it so
that&#39;s what I did
I rode my story on the paper and I
approached more than a hundred people
probably there are people here I
approach I&#39;m sure that because I
approached a lot of people asking them
maybe they can help
I approached neighbors I approached
friends journalists activists
politicians a lot of people teachers
sometimes people would listen to me
sometimes people would not listen
sometimes the door was remain closed
sometimes the door will open and one of
the pp who opened that door for me was
Hyrum here and was a director of the law
school which I was attending them and he
write I went to him he told my story and
asked him one question can you help me
he says yes I will do everything
possible so here are intervening and by
he interference it led to the
interference of others and Etienne had
resulted us me my brother and my mother
finally having a place to stay finally
having a residence permit to stay it was
a fantastic feeling
it was a self we were liberated still
can&#39;t remember it as it was yesterday
and what I learned additional to what my
mother told me was sometimes you can&#39;t
do it by yourself you need to help
others because of my experience I know
that I won&#39;t be standing here talking to
you guys if it wasn&#39;t for people like my
mother or people like hereand you
probably also have some persons just
like him because of that I choose to
dedicate my life to a purpose and my
purpose is freedom equality and equal
opportunity for all because I believe
that we are all born equally right in
dignity
therefore she matter who you are should
matter where you are born she matter
what sexual orientation you have should
matter what religion you have everyone
everyone everyone is entitled to a
future
so four years ago I became a member of
councils I became a member of Council
and I used these principles which are
just soldiers to guide me as a
politician we had an issue an issue all
illegal migrants two years ago and the
national government was normally
competent for this issue they could
deport the people but they also wouldn&#39;t
give them a status so they can stay here
in the country we as local government we
were confronted with all these people
because these people they can&#39;t work
these people can travel and because of
that then and don&#39;t have a food and
sometimes they have to sleep in street
so we were confronted with this issue we
couldn&#39;t look away you had to act and we
said to ourselves
listen we can do everything we got to
solve this problem and we gathered
together all parties left-wing
right-wing socialists liberals the
Greens conservatives progressive parties
we get it together and we made a plan
based on the principle of human dignity
an equal opportunity for all we came
together but we made this plan we said
let&#39;s provide those people in need
including illegal migrants with bad Bob
bread and support towards a sustainable
solution a future which means either
they can stay here or either they can go
back to the country but not the
in-between and I&#39;m proud that in my city
a city of it--over
that we did is together so my idea worth
spreading
is the words which my mother gave me if
you want something don&#39;t cry use
everything you gotta go for it what does
that mean it means that if you have
muscles well use your muscles if you
have humor use your humor you have
brains use your brains
and if you can talk well talk and if you
use your imagination this is how
together we can build the unthinkable
this is how together we can build
tomorrow
I would like to end my talk with the
words of my mother if you want to
achieve something use everything you&#39;ve
got go for it
mama thank you because of you you I&#39;m
fighting for a better future because of
you you I dedicate my life to a purpose
freedom equality equal opportunity for
all thank you
[Applause]
