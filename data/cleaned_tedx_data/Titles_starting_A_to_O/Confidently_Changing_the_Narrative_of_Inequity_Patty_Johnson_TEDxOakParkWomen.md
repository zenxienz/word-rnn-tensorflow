it was the first day of second grade at
a completely brand-new school and I was
at recess and I was absolutely terrified
I was walking around the playground
pretending I was supposed to pretending
I had some business being there and
after about a long 10 minutes or so
another 2nd grader came up to me and she
said hey you want to play catch I was
like yes so we started tossing the ball
back and forth and then a few minutes
more she said want to be best friends I
was like absolutely it was like it was
like a second graders version of winning
the lottery and we really did become
very good friends best friends in fact
and we spent a lot of time together went
to each other&#39;s homes and we would do
silly things like make up different
games we&#39;d take books and we&#39;d replace
some of the words into silly words like
booger or armpit
I read the sentences out loud and we&#39;d
like run around the living room just
holding our sides cracking up but there
was this one day when we were doing our
nerdy little mad libs thing and
afterwards she came and she sat really
close to me and almost in a whisper she
said I have a secret and I said a secret
well what is it I&#39;m 7 so nobody&#39;s
telling you secrets I was pretty pumped
so she said but you have to promise you
won&#39;t tell anyone and I said yeah yeah I
promise what is it she said I&#39;m Jewish
and I was like what you&#39;re Jewish
I had no idea what Jewish meant I came
from I came from very Indian immigrant
family and everything we did was very
Indian very immigrant the people we
spent time with the food we ate the way
we worshipped so I had no clue of what
it meant to be Jewish but I feigned my
shock because what it was a secret so I
had to respect that
and she said again she said please like
don&#39;t tell anyone you have to promise I
said yeah I promise but why she said
well my mom said people hate Jews and if
they find out they might try to kill me
and I&#39;ll never forget the fear in her
eyes when she said that and over the
years I&#39;ve seen it time and time again
and friends and family and patience
within myself and people are so
perplexed right now they&#39;re like how can
it be that our society is so hateful
that we&#39;re so emboldened to hate to
separate people to send people back to
their own country to separate people
because of their religious views or
sexuality but the thing is that hate
doesn&#39;t just dissipate right despite
having a two-term black president which
makes things even more confusing for
many it&#39;s an insidious thing and people
say well how do i how do I go about
making things better what do I say how
do I say it what do I do and when people
ask me that it often reminds me of how
people approach me and usually I think
they come from a really good place a
sensitive place but they say what are
you as though I&#39;m like a creature a bug
or something and I&#39;m kind of sassy and I
know what they&#39;re asking but I say oh
whoa I&#39;m a mom and I want to be guitar
legend and they&#39;re like no no but like
what race are you I&#39;m like oh I&#39;m Indian
and they&#39;re like oh would that make
sense and the most one-dimensional
response that I could possibly give them
makes them happy but most times I strike
up more conversation and at least it&#39;s
just a start right well other people say
oh I don&#39;t ask that question I&#39;m
colorblind I don&#39;t see color I don&#39;t see
difference the thing with being
colorblind though is that it&#39;s not
actually a thing you
you can&#39;t unsee the fact that I&#39;m brown
right now as hard as you might try or
that I&#39;m a woman or that many things
right and the bigger issue is if you
don&#39;t see color and you don&#39;t see
differences you also don&#39;t see the
realities of injustice and the fact that
there are many systemic barriers deeply
hurting many many people in our country
and in the world and people who are
colorblind or missing are missing a lot
of things in terms of how systemic
barriers work and instead of addressing
issues relating to housing or employment
people tend to blame individuals and say
well he&#39;s just not working hard enough
or well why don&#39;t they just move out of
that terrible neighborhood if it&#39;s so
violent as though the solution is that
easy right there are also many people
who say no I&#39;m not colorblind I see
what&#39;s going on especially right now
it&#39;s blatant people are hateful people
are mistreating people for just about
any trait that falls outside of this
narrow definition of mainstream American
society but I just feel hopeless I&#39;m not
sure what to do I&#39;m not sure where to go
from here I&#39;ve tweeted I&#39;ve retweeted
I&#39;ve posted a repost that I&#39;ve had
heated facebook arguments I&#39;ve put that
sign in front of my house hate has no
home here even in the backyard just in
case
and things just aren&#39;t changing and
there really is this sense that it&#39;s
just insurmountable that there&#39;s just so
much hate right now and our our whole
paradigm of our country improving has
just really changed for many people but
I do believe that there is an important
place to start but it may seem
counterintuitive maybe paradoxical even
but I believe that it&#39;s so important for
us to quiet our minds and to really
reflect on the interference that&#39;s
happening within ourselves
for instance privilege
how does privilege function within us
and many of us are privileged in
different ways and how does it impact
other people for instance what does it
mean to be male in America to be white
to be heterosexual to be in a certain
socio-economic bracket to be Christian
all of these things come with a great
deal of power privilege and mm-hmm
sometimes we forget these things because
we live them it&#39;s not that we&#39;re bad
people we&#39;re all good people but we may
forget or we may get comfortable and the
more insidious thing beyond privilege is
implicit bias implicit biases are those
rapid assumptions that we make about
people you know what do you think about
when you meet somebody wearing a smug
dress a short dress what do you think of
when you see two men holding hands what
assumptions are we making or how about
when we are exiting 290 on Austin on the
expressway ramp and we see someone who&#39;s
asking for money you might say uh-uh I&#39;m
not giving that guy my change I know
exactly where it&#39;s going and he&#39;s going
to go to the closest drug house
and we weren&#39;t from 0 to 60 making
assumptions really zero to three seconds
making making enough
about this gentleman who clearly has
fallen on bad times we don&#39;t know why we
don&#39;t know his story or we might say
look at him walking up and down that
ramp better than I can on this hot day
like he and go get a job but can he what
if he has some serious medical illness
or severe mental illness that&#39;s not
something we can see what if he has
cognitive impairments that aren&#39;t
obvious and he&#39;s not in fact able to get
a job and the thing is with our
assumptions they&#39;re so quick and they&#39;re
so integrated into our lives I mean a
lot of these things we were taught at a
very young age and they&#39;ve been
reinforced
they&#39;ve been integrated so much that we
believed them to be true we think we
think that our assumptions are all facts
and we know it all and we&#39;re rights but
are we right you know the beauty of
reflecting which is a really really
difficult thing to do
and you&#39;re saying you&#39;re asking but
right now for me to do all of this at
the same time but the beauty of it is
that when we face our assumptions and
take a really good look we&#39;re also able
to hear others assumptions others others
biases and others very opposing views
which is really really difficult to do I
know especially now when we&#39;re hurt and
we&#39;re enraged and confused by how
hateful people can be but even with the
most opposed views and I say most and
I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re typically not dealing
with the tiki torch variety we&#39;re
typically dealing with people who have
assumptions but care about people
generally but hold very strong to their
their views we can feel like Kathy was
saying very outraged right on both sides
but when we&#39;re able to reflect with the
our selves were able to hear others
better we&#39;re able to put aside our anger
we&#39;re able to defer our anger we don&#39;t
have to stop being angry we don&#39;t have
to stop being outraged because as we
heard that&#39;s a very powerful thing and
we can do something really good with
that but we can defer it so that we can
really listen to people and when we
listen even to people of different
backgrounds of different areas of
thought we may even find some common
threads and that&#39;s a really cool thing
to to experience now you might be saying
well I&#39;m just way too angry to listen
right now like I can&#39;t listen I need to
yell I need to scream I need to talk I
need to do something I need to put up
more signs maybe in my gang ways maybe
on my car something I need to do
something I need to go back on social
media on Facebook and post more things I
have to I can&#39;t I can&#39;t do this and
that&#39;s fine it&#39;s it&#39;s great I mean
having social media is a it&#39;s a blessing
but it can also be a curse because I
believe it&#39;s weakening our ability to
hear counter arguments to really
converse like we click like when we like
we rant when we don&#39;t
and then we log off and we&#39;re done and
we go about our day and so we&#39;re not
really processing what we&#39;re reading or
sharing with people right and the beauty
of conversation of listening is that
we&#39;re processing will me we&#39;re mulling
things over you know the thing as a
psychologist that such a powerful thing
that I have the opportunity to see is
the relationship with my clients you
know they they open up they talk about
their deepest wounds and I feel that
it&#39;s a blessing for me to be able to sit
with them with their pain but their hurt
but it&#39;s not the technique that a
therapist uses it&#39;s not where she&#39;s
gotten her degree
a therapist ability to suspend judgment
during that time to really listen and
that&#39;s what transforms someone through
horrendous things like gun violence and
extreme trauma and veterans PTSD and all
types of really dark places listening is
powerful and you&#39;re all looking at me
right now like I&#39;m asking you to go out
there and talk to the most obnoxious
people that you know and to do it face
to face you&#39;re like I can&#39;t just do it
on social media no I&#39;m asking you to
have these conversations these difficult
conversations and you might be cringing
inside and you may not want to do it but
it doesn&#39;t hurt to listen and in fact
when we&#39;re able to listen others are
more willing to reciprocate so when
we&#39;re ready to finally say something and
you&#39;re saying oh you&#39;re gonna allow me
to talk now like yes
yeah when when when it&#39;s our turn to
talk and we&#39;ve listened well we don&#39;t
have to state stats and facts and stuff
we&#39;ve heard on the news because people
are so desensitized to that sadly but
what we can do I think for people to
hear us well is to tell stories in order
to change the narrative of inequity I
believe we have to share our narratives
to be able to tell people how injustice
affects us how inequity affects us so
for instance when people are like oh
yeah but all lives matter and you feel
something bad inside and you want to
talk about the realities of how people
are killed because of the color of their
skin and why black lives matter even has
to be a movement it&#39;s okay to instead
share a story of how you&#39;ve been how
you&#39;ve been affected by injustice how
all lives should matter
but that doesn&#39;t apply to me or to a
friend or to a true account that I&#39;ve
read about or when people say oh well
you&#39;re not really latina or you&#39;re not
really Jamaican because that person
falls outside of the stereotype and
maybe articulates themselves in a way
that is surprising or it&#39;s like a
brilliant entrepreneur or doesn&#39;t fit
those assumptions that people sometimes
have we can share how demeaning it is to
say things like that like when people
say that to me when they&#39;re like oh
you&#39;re not really Indian I&#39;m like all
would you like me to talk like this with
the bobble head movements and yes
sometimes I do the bobble head think but
I&#39;m not a boo from the symptom Simpsons
I&#39;m not a caricature you can&#39;t put me in
a box I&#39;m too too sassy for that and
none of us can be put put in boxes none
of us can be defined by some
one-dimensional description no Alex
Kotlowitz is an author a journalist and
Oak Park resident actually who wrote the
book there are no children here it was
published in 1992 and what he did so
beautifully was took the question of
what are you and he transformed that
through narrative into who are you he
told a story of a black family living on
the west side of Chicago in the Henry
Horner homes and the what are you was
well he really focused on two of the
boys in the family the younger boys and
so there were two black males living on
the west side and poverty and crime but
he took that and transformed that into
who they really were there were two
young children who were facing barriers
like a poor educational system a broken
justice system a terrible housing system
and despite seeing people that they knew
and cared about being killed
they would say well if I make it to my
next birthday these are my visions these
are my dreams so what mr. Kotlowitz did
so wonderfully was restored humanity
into a area of our city that was so
highly dehumanized and continues to be
this book was written in 1992 which
breaks my heart so clearly we have a
whole lot of work to do but we can do it
all of us we too can transform the
question of what are you into who are
you
if only we&#39;re first able to ask
ourselves who we are thank you
