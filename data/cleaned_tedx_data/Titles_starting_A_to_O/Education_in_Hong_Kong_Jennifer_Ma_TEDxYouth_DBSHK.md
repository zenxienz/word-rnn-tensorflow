thank you good evening ladies and
gentlemen I&#39;m really happy to be here
today to share my story it&#39;s definitely
a big shoe to fill speaking out an actor
and a veteran TED speaker but I can
simply do it the Trump way which is my
way and hopefully I can share my story
and inspire some of you the theme today
is catalysts and the topic I was
assigned was education and social
mobility this is something that is
really close to my heart and I&#39;ve
dedicated the past nearly 15 to 17 years
working in various capacities on this
theme so what is catalyst I will start
by defining interpreting these words in
my eyes and then I will share my own
story and give a few words of advice to
students here so when I first looked at
this word catalyst it actually brought
back horrific memories of chemistry a
level and I thought but if I were to
apply the word catalyst to our everyday
life we can basically see it as an agent
of change someone or something that
affects change and not just any change
but change at a fast rate but to add to
that I actually see catalysts as
something that actually evokes change in
a positive way with that then I would
like to interpret the word social
mobility social mobility for most people
you would see it as a way to help and
the resource or grassroot students or
people move up the social hierarchy in
society however for you guys as many of
you Millennials I would like to also add
one more definition of social mobility
research has it that Millennials
nowadays will potentially change jobs 11
times in your life and potentially for
different industries so an abstract way
of seeing social mobility is this how do
you change from one social context to
another social context and how do you
transfer your skills
transfera mentality and still you know
change and excel in this new context so
at the moment it sounds a little bit
abstract so where did I get this
thoughts from and I will have to go back
to my own story and go back to 2008
where I was at Goldman Sachs and so for
those of you who knew what happened
during 2008 Goldman Sachs is not the
place you want to be or should be
because that was during a financial
crisis so I was seeing my friends being
you know we used to have an icy queue in
Goldman Goldman where we face a
community communicate with each other
with an internal network and my friends
were usually on the available category
but during that few months of financial
crisis I saw a lot of them dropped off
like flies into the N a category which
meant were fired and if you&#39;re fired at
goldman sachs you would be escorted out
so like criminal by guards so it was a
really really I would say interesting
but also quite terrifying period at the
bank but then a few months after
financial crisis government decided
especially my team which went down from
13 people to 2 they decided that they
had actually over fired so I was tasked
with two things one is to go out and
rehire ok especially looking at Hong
Kong graduates because we wanted someone
who could speak Cantonese and Mandarin
and the second task I was given is to
raise morale within the remaining teams
so I was asked to get involved with
community service and there were two
options and one option was picking up
rubbish in the beach and the other
option was to teach under-resourced
students interview skills so obviously I
chose the latter with those two things I
actually had a revelation that was
related to education with the first of
hiring new undergraduates and many of
them had these amazing Seavey&#39;s amazing
experiences amazing greats on paper but
when they came into the interviews or
even when we gave them an in
they didn&#39;t exhibit those critical
transferable skills necessary in the
work environment so that got me thinking
the world is changing much faster than
education is so we&#39;re no longer looking
at looking for knowledge knowledge you
can be replaced by Google I go into
Google and I will know much more than
you would ever know from research we
really needed skills so that&#39;s the first
revelation that came to me and I was
like what&#39;s going on with a field of
education the second thing is in
teaching these under-resourced students
our interview skills we were we
partnered with an NGO and it was very
underfunded and it was not very well
coordinated and the materials we were
given to teach the students were not up
to quality but the most important thing
is the students were actually teaching
were the wrong target what that means is
at the end of the interview skills
workshop we asked the students you know
would you ever want to apply to a
company like Goldman Sachs and they just
looked at us and said no I never thought
about that I actually just want to be a
sales in my local grocery next door so
we actually gave them and they looked at
us and they&#39;re like yo you guys are from
the Eiffel Towers we can never be there
we don&#39;t want to be there so I wait so
we felt that we were targeting the wrong
audience how can we actually target the
right people to make a bigger change
more effectively so that got me really
intrigued and into the field of
education and I decided to catalyze the
process go and speak to a lot of people
a lot of stakeholders in the field of
education including teachers politicians
investors NGOs schools and universities
and we asked them how can we help to
make a change in the education industry
and obviously the ones who were most
interested to talk to us were investors
of education companies and they said
look you know you can come in as a
corporate finance EA&#39;s and but then I
actually wanted to get my hands dirty in
the field of education I wanted to
experience
myself I wanted to try it out myself in
evoking change in the industry so I
decided to quit goldman sachs and be a
local secondary school teacher so you
should have seen the face on my father
or my father when I told him this
decision he he thought I went crazy
after the financial crisis and and I
said you know I just really want to do
something before I turn 30
and as I went on and I left Goldman and
then I realized I was properly
unemployed and properly unemployable
because apparently you need
qualifications to be a teacher so I said
they&#39;re thinking I am NOT unemployed and
I&#39;m not employable so I knocked on a few
local school stores and not know not
many people took me on board apart from
one they said I could be a substitute
teacher and I ended up teaching
geography and history I relearned
everything but with that then what did I
see in my experience in this local
secondary school what are the education
gaps that we observed and what are these
gaps that we wanted to fill I&#39;ve
observed three things one is I realized
a lot of students actually lacked a
sense of direction now I&#39;m not saying
that at the age of 10 and 12 and 15
you&#39;re expected to tell me that I want
to be a lawyer
definitely for life or medic definitely
for life Mississippi had said that to me
then your parents must have done a
really good job brainstorming you brain
washing you but I just wanted to see a
little bit of sense of direction in
terms of what I might interested in what
am i interested to pursue could I turn
that interest into Burton to a passion
do I have something that that inspires
me that I want to take it further that
kind of direction so upon asking
students why not thinking one or two
steps further they say well my goal is
to get into university which is right
and universities care about grades I can
put down in my application medicine law
you know psychology science social
sciences ultimately I don&#39;t get to
choose my grades will
choose for me which direction I should
go so many of them are either frustrated
because they&#39;re not getting that grade
in that particular subject or they feel
deflated so unmotivated and that is one
other trend that we see they are unsure
of what options are out there certainly
some of the students are really really
well equipped star students but for them
when I see them and I talk to them and
teach them I realize a lot of them have
a lot of knowledge but not the
transferable skills that I think they
will need to excel in University and
beyond
so with those three inspirations we
really wanted to help them find the
direction potentially it could be greedy
seek interest to make it into a passion
identify options so they can be more
positive in the process of Education and
also build skills so they&#39;re not
competitive just short term but
competitive in life so we did a lot of
things including skills programs you
know consulting etc but what was really
close to my heart is that how can I go
back and did what I did at Goldman and
help the under-resourced students and
this time I will focus on the right
target those who are can really really
help and those who really do need our
help so we focus on under-resourced but
high achieving students a lot of people
in Hongkong say when you&#39;re helping on
the resource you&#39;re looking at the
marginal students and when you say
marginal a lot of them think they must
be you know may be on drugs or they
might must be from really horrible
broken families and you know a horrible
living conditions but for from our
perspective we wanted to help the
marginal students who are at the top of
the under resource segment who if we can
give them a little bit of inspiration a
little bit more exposure a little bit
more guidance the world is this so that
is the segment that we wanted to target
so what do we do we went out and
partnered with Singh James settlements
and ten schools or we started with three
and now we have fifteen and then we are
our vision was to bridge the
opportunities gap
for the under-resourced and high
achieving students through three things
one we wanted them to have more exposure
to find the direction so we partnered
with fifty companies across 24
industries all the way from medics
Hospital hospitals law firms to media
companies to tech startups like 9gag is
also one of our partner companies to
provide these students with career
opportunities and mentorship second
thing then is they need to build skills
because skills will not just get you
into university but it will make you a
much more or rounded and complete person
post University
so we deployed all our teachers to
schools and host big literacy days
public speaking events reading and
writing skills get them to read books as
not in the textbook but actually books
that people actually like to read so and
that was really really interesting
especially for the corporates that
actually they&#39;re actually partnered with
us to provide these skills training a
lot of these skills training is starts
off with one thing and that is self
reflection personality identification
and what is it that you want to achieve
in life and that is provided by lots of
the corporates lastly then is helping
them identify options Hong Kong versus
overseas Hong Kong universities are
great they are amazing but they only
took on 18% of students in Hong Kong
they are very much great base so if
you&#39;re not a natural-born academics you
might not be able to pursue your dream
overseas universities they&#39;re looking a
little bit more diverse aspects look as
skills they look at your interest they
looking at extracurricular activities
and hopefully in some ways we can help
some of our students pursue these
options so what do we do this is just a
case study that over one of our students
the girl on the right is Rosemarie and
she is she was an under resourced
student high very under resourced so
every step of the way of her education
she actually funded herself through
going for essay competitions and getting
few thousand here a few thousand they&#39;re
funded by the government funded by
school and and her her at that point she
thought I&#39;m good at writing I should
really be a lawyer
unfortunately because she is half
African and half Chinese an ethnic
minority her Chinese were scoring a 1 to
2 as you would know that would not
qualify her for any subjects in Hong
Kong so if she has stayed in Hong Kong
and we hadn&#39;t met her she would have not
have got into any university and she
would have just gone off and done
something on her own before University
so with her we helped her find her
direction we put her through various
work experiences not just law but also
media advertising so she sees things
beyond her imminent goal then she
decided that actually I really like
social sciences because I want to know
how the world comes about because
through media where she hosted a radio
show she actually got real interest in
sociology and anthropology and then we
identified options for her
with someone who could not have the
right grades she would not be she would
be penalized for the Hong Kong and even
UK system but what about us
she has interested in soccer
collectivities she&#39;s a great leader
so we nurtured her in that sense we
encouraged her to go for these essay
competitions but not just writing random
essays but going for international
competitions writing about you know
policy making about politics about
sociology and anthropology but related
to you know ethnic minorities in another
in other countries and US loves this
kind of diversity so she applied but got
rejected by every single University and
we thought something must be wrong in
the process we worked with her on skills
we worked any of you who have done SAT
and all those ATAC TX Amma Nations would
know it&#39;s skill based is not knowledge
based we worked with her on that so we
were like what could have gone wrong so
we went back and partnered with her
school to look at her recommendation
letter which was not written in the u.s.
style so we soory redid that reapplied
and she ended up getting into University
of Chicago which as many of you would
know is the top 5 US universities and
she got a present
your scholarship and she is now actually
a case study for the university so for
this student we did not just bridge her
social mobility upwards within the
society but we also bridged her from one
context of what she was in to another
context and she seamlessly transitioned
because she had those skills that
preparation and that aspiration to
bridge the gap so what does this mean to
you because you might not be under
resourced you might not be had the same
profile as her but after out of these
three things I just want to focus on the
first which is finding direction a lot
of students say I&#39;m only 16 17 how can I
find direction number one identify what
interests you it doesn&#39;t have to be
academic it could be extracurricular it
could be video gaming okay video gaming
I see a lot of knots there number two
reflect what are the elements that you
love in video gaming it&#39;s just that
we&#39;re not in this physical motion also
the strategy or is it you know the the
the business part of it they can buy
other people&#39;s weapons etc okay and then
thirdly relates the elements to real
world okay and you might know you might
say I don&#39;t know what the real world is
like well a lot of people do so go out
and make connection be proactive go to
education and career fairs and talk to
people with experience research
eliminates what you think is not
something that&#39;s of interest and then
try to get some experience with this
work or whether through summer programs
or through talking to alumni so with
that with that with that you know with
that kind of mentality we helps a lot of
students and the resource going to
Cambridge and then this student is a
dropout was kicked out of school and
ended up getting to seven medical
schools BSC student who otherwise are
most people just think DSE you can&#39;t do
humanities going into history in
politics at Oxford more under-resourced
students and then more and more of these
case studies so it&#39;s been a really
rewarding experience for us because we
go back to our first mission and vision
and we are helping students not tutoring
not academics but really bridging the
skills gap into real life and also
bridging social mobility by offering the
high quality service that you have seen
a private sector and applying it to the
public sector so with that time I shall
conclude my presentation and I just want
to leave all the students here with a
few thoughts it&#39;s really important that
you really think one or two steps ahead
and think about what really intrigues
you what really interests you and pursue
that interest make it a passion well if
it becomes a passion you don&#39;t have to
make it a passion it will become a
passion and hopefully you will then
perform and Excel
effortlessly because you love what you
do thank you very much
