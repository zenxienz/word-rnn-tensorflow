v16 2-0 - 26 B and - 22 B both of these
arrangements of numbers and letters may
seem meaningless or long and boring but
to me they symbolize beauty uncertainty
the edge over humans are capable of they
are not the answers to the next a CT
exam I wish
perhaps if I gave you the prefixes of
these strings of gibberish Kepler Kepler
22b of course referencing the Kepler
space telescope the Gateway the infinite
cosmos the key the vast room of mystery
the cool thing about Kepler&#39;s mission is
that it tries to find exoplanets planets
outside of our insignificant solar
system amidst the vast ocean of
nothingness and so those were the names
of exoplanets planets outside our solar
system
the first one is codenamed Methuselah
it is the oldest exoplanet and one of
the first ones we have ever found but
the beautiful and unique thing about it
is that it orbits a dual star system it
orbits a pulsar and a white dwarf one
can only imagine the Sun sets Kepler 22b
is on the other end of that spectrum it
is believed that Kepler 22b will one day
be humanity&#39;s next home but why show you
the beauty of these distant worlds these
two exoplanets have been chosen to
highlight what to me is the horizon in
human knowledge the farthest point we
can reach
it has also helped me look at our own
world differently earth everything you
have ever experienced everyone you have
ever loved all life as we know it has
lived here the Blue Marble has always
seemed an island of life in a sea of
emptiness but is it really what if
somewhere out there trillions of
kilometres away so far away that even
time is experienced differently relative
to us someone is asking the same
question are we alone in the universe
well all of you doubters and critics of
extraterrestrial life beginning with my
mom calculations used from Kepler data
have found that the number of habitable
planets in our galaxy is 40 billion
therefore there&#39;s bound to be life out
there somewhere and what if we suddenly
received signal from an intelligent
extraterrestrial civilization
well presuming that the signal came from
10,000 light-years away not only are we
hearing something that occurred 10,000
light years ago it would also take
10,000 years for our response to reach
them by that time their civilization
could be extinct leaving our message
wandering endlessly in the cosmos what
about us and our existence what if we
ourselves enough from this world
the rosetta spacecraft orbiting comet
67p has found essential amino acids and
elements such as phosphorus in its
Comets atmosphere this suggests that
comets could have brought life such as
in the form of microorganisms or
ingredients to life by colliding into
habitable worlds
could this be what happened to earth
comments bringing life if so where did
those microorganisms or ingredients come
from and what do those distant habitable
worlds look like what will become of
humanity in the future interplanetary
civilization or meaning let&#39;s start us
questions multiply even faster than
technological advances needed to grapple
with them in fact although we probably
won&#39;t know the answers to many of these
questions the mere follow them gives
inspiration and motivation to many they
encourage us to expand our horizons and
look beyond in the words of Plato
astronomy compels the soul to look
upward and leads us from this world to
another
