so let me start by asking you a question
can anyone here read that sign on the
slide if you can&#39;t I guess most of you
probably think it has something to do
with cows or his children so let me tell
you story the story behind this sign so
I&#39;m that little boy in the middle and
and I grew up in East Germany and when I
grew up I walked past this sign almost
every day because it was attached to a
door on my family&#39;s farm where we kept
our cows it essentially translates to
certified tuberculosis free cattle you
know being a little boy I didn&#39;t think
much of all at all I only knew from my
grandfather that tuberculosis is a
disease that can make house very sick
but apart from this you know as being a
little boy I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t care much
about it
so now fast-forward 30 odd years and I&#39;m
standing here giving a presentation
about eradicating tuberculosis so why is
that obviously you know a lot of things
change in 30 years not just the way I
dress but also I&#39;m now a trained
microbiologist and I specialize in
infectious disease research and
particularly on tuberculosis so
obviously I now know a lot more and I
know that TB how tuberculosis is also
known doesn&#39;t just affect cows it
actually a major problem in the world so
let me start by giving you some facts so
TB as I said tuberculosis also known is
the biggest killer amongst all
infectious diseases on that planet over
the last 200 years it is estimated that
TB has killed about 1 billion people so
this is more than malaria plague
smallpox influenza HIV cholera combined
that&#39;s all diseases you may have heard
about
but what about closer to you know 2017
so the latest data we&#39;ve got is from
2015 and even two years ago there was
still one point eight million people
dying from tuberculosis more than ten
million cases and so why is this just to
put into context the recent Ebola
outbreak in western Africa killed about
eleven to twelve thousand people this is
about tuberculosis kills more in two
days every day every year but not too
many people know about it why is this TB
is a lung disease it&#39;s caused by a
bacterium called microbiome tuberculosis
and it really affects mainly to poor
people on the planet because it&#39;s a
disease of overcrowding and poor hygiene
and it all starts when an infected
patient that has active tuberculosis
coughs up the bacteria and they can
infect others around them and we know
that about two billion people in other
words about a third of the world&#39;s
population is infected with tuberculosis
luckily only 1.8 million people of those
died but it&#39;s still why too many so I
said that TB is a disease of the poor
people on the planet and you can see
here on the world map that it really
affects mainly developing countries in
sub-saharan Africa Asia Eastern Europe
and also South America and unfortunately
these are the same regions of the world
where other infectious diseases such as
hiv/aids is very prevalent and we know
that being infected was both disease at
the same time is a major risk factor for
actually dying when you infected with
tuberculosis however probably the most
the more relevant problem and also more
relevant to people in in the Western
world is that it becomes incredibly
harder to treat tuberculosis
tuberculosis is a treatable disease if
you&#39;ve got it you have to take drugs for
about six months and then if you strain
it in fact you as susceptible to those
drugs you will be cured however over the
last decade or so more and more of those
bacteria have become resistant to the
drugs that we use to treat TB and we
call that multi drug-resistant
tuberculosis or MDR TB the slide you can
see here you know it&#39;s not a solar
system and I don&#39;t really want you to
look at all the details but it&#39;s a very
interesting slide from the World Health
Organization that shows us how much it
costs to treat one case of multi
drug-resistant tuberculosis in different
countries of the world and without
looking at all the details it really
tells us that in many countries it is
more expensive to treat one case of
multi drug-resistant tuberculosis than
the GDP per capita in that country so
it&#39;s an enormous public health issue and
it&#39;s very very expensive and if you
think that MDR TB is far away then think
twice because here in Far North topical
Queensland we&#39;re only a short boat ride
away from one of the most severe
outbreaks of multi drug-resistant
tuberculosis on the planet on some of
those islands of the coast of Papua New
Guinea we have such a high incidence of
MDR TB that there is a major problem and
you know that it&#39;s only a short trip
from one island to the next from Papua
New Guinea to Australia and from one of
those islands to the mainland and Bucs
don&#39;t respect borders once they&#39;re on
the mainland they can go anywhere so
what can we do and this is really where
scientists like myself come in because
we know that instead of treating a
disease we can also prevent it or we can
even eliminate it and how can we do this
we know that the only and the best way
to read acade a disease is vaccination
because we&#39;ve done it before
we have almost eradicated polio which
you can see here and we have eradicated
smallpox both of these diseases where
all are almost eradicated because we
have an effective vaccine that was
rolled out worldwide by the World Health
Organization the WHL Water Association
has put out a very ambitious goal to
eliminate TB by 2050 this is about 35
years from now the same timeframe utley
can see here for polio so we know that
if we will have an effective vaccine it
is possible to eradicate tuberculosis
some of you in the audience may think
now oh well there&#39;s a vaccine against TB
I&#39;ve probably got it when I was a child
and yes that&#39;s right there is a vaccine
it&#39;s called BCG it was introduced in
1921 and it&#39;s been given to more than
four billion people on the planet
unfortunately TB doesn&#39;t DCG does not
prevent the real lung tuberculosis in
adults it has prevented several millions
of kids from dying from childhood
versions of tuberculosis but it will
never stop the transmission cycle and
therefore help us to eliminate a disease
and again this is the point where
scientists like myself and others can
make a difference
there are about several dozen different
research groups on the planet currently
working to make a better TB vaccine I&#39;m
one of them and although this slide may
look like a bit of a race it is really a
global effort where we all come together
and try to make a difference to come up
with a effective vaccine that works to
develop a vaccine is very expensive and
long process it takes at least 20 years
to move a vaccine from the preclinical
studies all the way through to a
licensed product
you can see here illustrated by those
blue bars that some of those vaccine
candidates how we call them have already
progressed to different parts of these
clinical pipeline some are very close to
being licensed but unfortunately in very
recent years it has become apparent that
many of those vaccines are not better
than BCG so there may be an option an
alternative to BCG but they&#39;ve warmed
help us eliminate the disease and that
is why we can&#39;t be complacent that we
have to continue to work on new concepts
new methods and new strategies to
develop a vaccine that actually works
the little red arrow on the bottom
that&#39;s me my vaccine is still in the
preclinical stages but I&#39;m trying to
work on new concepts that are currently
not used by those Iraq vaccines and this
is where the science comes in so I&#39;m
trying to keep it as simple as possible
but there was me so most vaccines target
immune cells in your body depicted here
by those purple cell when a vaccine is
introduced shown here in red it has
taken up by those cells and then
presented on the surface of these cells
that&#39;s how we call this and this leads
to the attraction of other immune cells
and they then lead to protection against
the disease this is quite common for
most diseases and most vaccines
unfortunately for the vaccines being
developed for tuberculosis many of the
ones that are currently going through
this clinical pipeline targeted cell
type that is destroyed by HIV and I&#39;ve
told you earlier that HIV is a major
risk factor for reactivation of
tuberculosis
so these vaccines will not work in
particular in the context of HIV in
these countries so I had a different
idea I am a microbiologist so I can work
on genetically engineered bacteria and
immunology so what I did
we still introduced a vaccine we still
target these particular immune cells
well what we did is we made a vaccine
that remains inside the cell and what
that does it leads to the secretion of
messenger molecules how we call them and
these messenger molecules target
particular cell types that can also be
protective but they do not get destroyed
by HIV infection and secondly we are
also trying to work on a new approach to
deliver the vaccine because currently
BCG is given as a needle injection and
believe me not many children will look
like this and have just been given so
but we also know that a needle based
vaccination only generates immune cells
that are kind of circulating through the
body but not really go to the lung where
they&#39;re needed when a tuberculosis
infection occurs so in our approach
we&#39;re also trying to develop a vaccine
that can be administered directly into
the lung was a puffer and we know that
this approach generates a particular
type of immune cell that remains in the
lung and can act directly when
tuberculosis infection occurs and if
this approach will be successful this
global effort comes to a conclusion then
I hope by 2050 when I would be a
grandfather I will be able to tell my
grandchildren that TB has been
eradicated not just from cows in East
Germany but from everyone in the whole
world thank you
