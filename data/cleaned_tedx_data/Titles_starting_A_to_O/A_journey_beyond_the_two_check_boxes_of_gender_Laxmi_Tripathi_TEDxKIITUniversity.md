butterfly effect how beautiful is the
butterfly isn&#39;t it
and we always admire and as a child we
all would have tried to catch it and
when we caught it we could feel the
color in our hands that is even when we
tried to harm that butterfly especially
we shouldn&#39;t be touching it but still
when we touch it
we give pain but in that return that
butterflies gives you his or her colors
in your heart life is all about colors
see I represent the oldest ethnic
transgender community in the world which
is known as the hit earth for kiner&#39;s
today&#39;s TEDx talk is about the butterfly
change the butterfly in its own life
till becoming a butterfly goes to a
complete process of change right from
the cocoon to caterpillar and then from
again it is such a beautiful thing what
Mother Nature says life for me would
have been a butterfly effect
I Thea see Lakshmi today wouldn&#39;t have
been Lakshmi or 20 years ago or when I
was a child normally people ask me
Lakshmi when you felt that you were
different I never felt I was different
the world made me realize that I was
different I was only simple child who
wanted to study and wanted to enjoy my
childhood as any other child child
doesn&#39;t has a sexuality but in that way
because I didn&#39;t fit in the boxes what
our society had created of male and
female I was considered abnormal I was
considered not right
I was not considered straight among
those boxes where I could fit in because
there was no box that time our previous
our Indian culture and we as Indians
where our ancestors do created a space
for children like us but after
colonization we completely forgot I
often say we become we have really
become dustbin to the European and US
sisters and sad it is because the whole
education system is still very colonial
to its roots and we don&#39;t have the guts
to change it or to create space
yesterday I was really I&#39;m really
fortunate I came took it and I&#39;ve had
the opportunity to go to kiss for me in
my lifetime if I see a butterfly
complete change and complete whole
process of thing is what is kiss over
there you know it gave me a complete
satisfaction that how everybody is equal
then our times we didn&#39;t have that kind
of a system or we didn&#39;t have space
until the date people like us don&#39;t have
space
because I was very feminine and my
feminity was crushed under the
patriarchal society and sexually abused
as a child at a very young age when the
child shouldn&#39;t be knowing anything it
went on for a process but I learnt at
one point of time to say no and when I
had the guts to say no life changed it&#39;s
necessary but the saddest part the
patriarchy is so strongly developed in
the culture in our roots which was not
it actually it was not there with
patriotic immorality and marrow morality
literally raped our culture completely
and then we see whether it is gay
lesbian transgender X Y Z is all foreign
culture this kills me everything was in
Indian culture and everything is there
in Indian culture only but we have
started listening to leaders who
themselves know don&#39;t know what is being
Indian if a woman wants to go out
she&#39;s subjected to harassment stigma
discrimination it&#39;s not woman it&#39;s
feminity and the same feminity of mine
was targeted UniFirst first I thought I
was a gay child you know be high but the
gays thought I was not a gay again
stigma in that whole circle you know
then I became a drag drag queen is
dressed like a girl we had parties we
had fashion shows beauty pageants and I
always want the crown till they made me
the judge you know it was not that I
wanted only for a function to dress up
and be like that if you meet me anytime
anywhere you will find Lakshmi this way
very rarely people like Smitha can see
or dolly my daughter you know have seen
me without makeup normally maximum don&#39;t
have the opportunity and who have the
opportunity they are aghast they cannot
even believe this is the same Lakshmi
you know for me when I decided that I am
a part of the hijra culture it was
completely strange for my friends I
disowned by everybody I didn&#39;t know even
how to express myself to my parents and
my parents came to know of that I have
gone in a community which is not that
well accepted and which is considered
stigma in the society by the idiot box
by the television when I was giving an
interview we as children think that no
parents don&#39;t know anything but our
parents have produced us they know much
more about us than what we because stage
always gives me that pleasure and that
dignity which the society could not give
me the stage did not discriminate yet in
a way our speech Katamari Hindu
Sanskriti Authority Sanskrit me
this is we are speed this way our speeds
never discriminated my life went on once
what happened Sabina Frances Centuria
they wanted to start a organization or
velikiy Lakshmi when you come as a
founding member I said okay my I will
come they were also heroes and when
educated Sabina is the first doctorate
of a country from Tata Institute of
Social Sciences and now she is in us
then Sabina went out of my life and I
said they Co I will become I will become
a founding member but I cannot become a
social worker now Vogon dahua cotton

kakuta Pankaj : that cock a woman acres
of thickness in the game a double in a
need to search I incur okay fine I sign
we start they started working and I used
to meet many ages in my life you know in
parties functions and suddenly I happen
to go to karate put on the red light
area and I saw the conditions in that
time HIV was really the boiling topic of
the public health sector all over the
world and then we saw people die due to
the community pressures and some
politics shebeen and Korea had to go
away from the city Mumbai and went to
swap to live their life as it is but the
organization was left alone
then my Sabinas guru who was my
grandmother she said no no you are
educated you should say memory the
combined may I say say wrong here to
Mujib alluvial cotton he said he been
chemically so chemically without makeup
a sunny yoga but a neighbor tempted me
to organisation Salonika and she&#39;s smart
so she she accepted everything what the
way I wanted but in that period I felt
like a prison I have seen and I have
felt that my own human existence is
considered transparent the biggest grief
in this world is a grief of being
unloved what was a mistake of that
childhood sexuality was different was
thrown out of the house and then that
child to survive the child bees on the
street and then on the street what not
happens you&#39;re sexually assaulted you&#39;re
forced to beg at the end do you give up
everything and then you&#39;re forced into
flesh trade only to have bread and
butter in your life where did we come I
didn&#39;t come from the southern sky maybe
at markic except Adar we may be of each
a dishonest they do PK Maravich Venice
Yangon make pita but life is different
and one thing is beautiful across the
world about my sisters and my doctors
and my friends of my type we have one
thing the biggest strength in this world
is strength not to surrender and that
strength we have
we shouldn&#39;t surrender to any negativity
in our life life is beautiful it&#39;s like
the butterfly we have to teach our sense
to fly with color not without color
that&#39;s life
the decision taken at that junction of
time was right for even it is right
today people say Laxmi did you ever have
regrets I said no I live with my
decisions and with my principles in my
life I love to be free I never thought
this Laxmi Narayan threw a party after
accepting my sexuality this way I would
be ever having dignity in my life I
would be able ever be respected in my
life by others I still remember when my
father was asked in an interview that t
VAR eg what do you feel that your eldest
so-called son is a hater I was amazed by
the answer of my you know Orthodox
brought up Brahmin family man who says
that my child is my child for me Laxmi
Narayan three parties preferences would
be different but my child is my child
that is nobody is Krishna
it clearly thinks guts today I can talk
about how much I would have faced in the
society how the society would have
looked at me but when I have lost my
father but I believe he&#39;s always with me
my my mother I have my beautiful mother
they say God could not be every soul I
see it&#39;s all about how you have the guts
to accept yourselves your friends your
dear and near your college times and in
your school there are teachers
professors you would have felt people
who don&#39;t fix in those boxes attends you
because it is not your mistake
till not to accept because it is a
society has you know society has created
that kind of an atmosphere that we as
Indians have forgot accepting people as
they are
because we are still somewhere very
colonial they changed everything we
didn&#39;t do we have time to give to
ourselves in a competitive life now this
waiters patterns we forget ourselves and
specially womanhood in this country or
anywhere in the world are not taught to
love themselves they have to love their
family father&#39;s name brother
then after husband children and the
tankless job what they do that they have
a somewhere in the hadoo Literature
Festival and I was doing the opening
only 27% of work of the - consider twerk
sad isn&#39;t it the mother till her death
she will see to that the child eats
properly my husband is okay that word we
don&#39;t even want to respect then what we
will learn to respect any other woman
when we don&#39;t know to respect our own
mothers to consider immaterial if we
start considering everybody as human
beings that will solve our problems
because even the religion which I am
born
it says Ambrym has me the brahma horizon
me the eternal cosmic energy I am a part
I am a pregnant of that eternal energy
so I am Brahma has me and the best thing
Brahma the Creator doesn&#39;t has any sex
now if every TED talk I would have said
the biological men how much men they are
they have to decide and in that faith
the whole patriarchy has been developed
because prakruti itself what
bhagavad-gita also said I am a freshness
and I am only one purusa entire prakruti
is nari and Nora - ties completely
complete even if we see signs formats x
XA square s where is complete
men who are XY that day we have to be
the change makers because we are the
river
it responsibly doesn&#39;t lie if we know to
pay the taxes we should understand the
responsibility of the society also hide
any wish that you know in my lifetime I
had never thought we would have a
Supreme Court judgement where I would
have the right to decide my gender my
sexuality not the state not any medical
officer nor any agency and I was a part
of it I never thought this Laxmi would
go to United Nations this Laxmi would be
on such an important position this Laxmi
would be in over 32 books you know if
you consider me transparent then you all
don&#39;t think this for me you know
hallelujah this is the way one has to be
life is changing now even UGC like in
UGC we have male/female and third gender
in all the equity there are third gender
if there is also one tract or gender in
any college there should be a separate
restroom in ER because we forget the
sensitiveness to respect the opposite
person as a human being we forget
because our class a financial
socio-economic structure is such a way
that if we are on a higher we treat
people like shit shouldn&#39;t be
then we will learn to accept your the
new Indians who will create India&#39;s
India and if you could at least have a
fraction of second in your heart that
you think that everybody is equal and
everybody needs to be respected our
India would be a different leader in a
different complete you not only with
economic growth but human development
also because no growth no economic no
GDP growth is a complete growth of a
society the society growth will only
happen when you have in heart and when
the human development also increases
with it I always see you know my school
teachers used to say when I used to be
depressed then they they said I used to
cry at times in my craft room with men
and Miss and then she used to say maybe
you&#39;re not the crowd you&#39;re the face in
the crowd and it stuck to me it really
stuck to me that I&#39;m face in the crowd
and I always went with one poem in my
first standard which I had studied you
know Robert Southey my days among the
Nerds have passed it was the scholar in
the last four lines you know I say I
shall perish die not my name it shall be
carved in the marbles to be remembered I
never knew I could create such a world
for me today my transgenders and my
hydras and my Canaries are all over even
in Bob Nash were there are two three
organs and even my gran Chile&#39;s now they
are my own Chile&#39;s twenty years before
Orissa had non acceptance for
transgenders people today but the fact
is that the society has to be told when
the crying baby gets the bloodiest
amount of milk or unit tension in the
family so I was a crying baby right from
the center to the states and it&#39;s right
one should you know the baddest thing in
this country is that we don&#39;t know our
own suicide and we as children and we as
students decide that this is thing what
we need to create a change because I
never felt
could create that change I could have a
Supreme Court Worth date I could be an
author I could be an actress I was only
a performer Jame hitomi Shelley I
thought my life is ended at times I do
get many roadblocks I started
kindergarten so the religious apart of
the Hindus and Athens and I never
thought in advance at all so I will be
the I would be holding a position which
is as equal to the Shankar Acharya and
knowing about yourself is the most
important being comfortable in your own
skin is very important when you are
comfortable in your own skin and when
you know yourself when you know your
good points and when you know your
negative points then only you can
achieve success it&#39;s necessary to accept
your own self my this body is temple to
my soul in this world it&#39;s easy to
criticize it is it used to say I&#39;m a
victim but I always say my life is a
celebration it&#39;s like the rainbow I
celebrate every minute of my life and I
believe that all of you should have that
art of being in that celebration of
course every coin has both the sides
there are you know some gray sides some
good size but in that grey sides also we
have to be positive to think that the
light is ours
the next day sunrise will be mine at
times I really wonder that this is just
a start for me because nothing nothing
stops me and I enjoy doing everything
because every second I know that to what
I&#39;m speaking over here standing at the
body at the stage at this we are speed
it is gone it will be only a history so
this I live to the fullest over here I
love myself even you should try to love
yourself
we don&#39;t ask much I will only ask that
treat every human as equal to yourself
as human beings learn to give love and
condition
