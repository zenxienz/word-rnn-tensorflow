thank you I&#39;d like to begin with a
famous quote that I think we all know
behind every iconic Asian Australian
newsreader is a straight white man
desperately grabbing ahold of her
coattails and claiming credit for all
her success good afternoon my name is
Chris Leben and I am that straight white
man now if you&#39;re not sure who that
iconic newsreader is it&#39;s of course this
woman SBS newsreader and Gold Logie
loser
miss Li Lin Shannon come on I ran I ran
a campaign it&#39;s my fault too and I&#39;m one
of the creative minds behind her comedy
character also called Li Lin Chen but
you might have seen on SBS&#39;s youth news
and current affairs program the feed in
sketches such as this you know people
often come up to me and ask oh my god
and then I amazed them for assuming they
the right to sleep to me biting satire
there you can hear the influences
Shakespeare Chaucer they&#39;re all there
and basically I&#39;m here today to teach
you how to solve one of the greatest
questions of our time how exactly do you
turn a respected newsreader into a
comedy star some of the brightest
thinkers in history have pondered this
question from Aristotle to Socrates to
other philosophers who didn&#39;t come up on
the first page of my Google results and
while the answer may have eluded them I
think I figured it out when turning a
news reader into a comedy a character
the major rule is you must defy
expectations
now you&#39;re probably sitting there
thinking Chris the mere act of turning a
news reader into a comedian is in itself
defying expectations and put simply yes
but put more complexly
maybe not you see it is true that we
don&#39;t often see our news readers
cracking jokes or moving away from their
more serious personas unless of course
they&#39;re caught off guard that was
torched by the Taliban during the fight
the Afghan army did manage to get a grip
on this situation but the Taliban
managed to strike in the very heart of
this city leaving many here wondering
what will be hip next to that story a
footnote to that clip Li Lin has not
given me permission to air this today
and she is gonna kept me in so much shit
by the way that handsome is Dan rivers
and he&#39;s a ITV correspondent in the UK
and according to Twitter he is
unfortunately for Li Lin very much
married but as Li Lin constantly likes
to remind me a ring don&#39;t mean a thing
so Dan if you are watching she&#39;s coming
for you now whilst we&#39;re gonna be trying
to defy expectations we also need to
follow one of the most basic rules of
comedy the best comedy comes from truth
basically you take your subject in our
case Li Lin Chen and you find some
real-life traits about her and
exaggerate them for a comedic purpose
when I was tasked with this and I just
joined the feed
I found this quite difficult because
like the rest of Australia I didn&#39;t
watch SBS
seriously look at their writings I quit
in November I can&#39;t get in trouble
anymore so because I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t
really even know who Leland Qin was so I
went around and asked her colleagues for
stories about her a little bit of
tidbits of information that I could use
to write this character and they told me
that she was a fashionista an avid lover
of beer and that she regularly went to
backpacker hotels to pick up
international hotties as she depleted
Australia&#39;s supply now that last bit
sounds like a joke but I didn&#39;t write
that someone actually told me that and I
hope it&#39;s real so suddenly
Leland turned from a newsreader into an
alcoholic I was drunk
most of the ages fashion-obsessed you&#39;re
getting close to the truth we keep
pulling into thread not Saunders I think
you don&#39;t it&#39;s vintage violent come on
you&#39;re gonna fight me to death or talk
me to death
less gabbing and more stabbing sexual
monster six packs you just want
so once we release this character first
on TV and then later on the internet
things started to take off people
responded to it they liked it but why
was the writing particularly good I&#39;ve
read way too many internet comments to
believe that but I do know that we were
doing one thing that wasn&#39;t really being
seen on Australian TV we were featuring
an older Asian woman in a position of
power and unfortunately that wasn&#39;t that
common no one wants to hear a straight
white guy talk about screen diversity
which is awkward because our next topic
is screen diversity and I understand
being the last talker at this TEDx event
and being a strike straight white man
talking about diversity I am a huge part
of a problem I am so sorry but diversity
is important Australia is a very diverse
country 32 percent of our population
come from a non Anglo background we have
an increasingly older population and I
don&#39;t know if you know this but 51% of
our population are women I was as
surprised as you are
I don&#39;t know
patriarchy but basically Li Lin takes
all those boxes but we never bring
attention to it
those facts that she is Asian older and
a woman doesn&#39;t really come into the
character we never make stereotypical or
offensive jokes about any of those
topics what is important though is that
Leland&#39;s character is always high status
whilst those around her a low status and
inept sometimes to the detriment of my
own self-esteem
it&#39;s not important that way what matters
now is I&#39;ve been working in TV for about
eight years now and I&#39;ve been on quite a
bit I&#39;ve only been recognized once and
it was at a urinal
when a dude turned to me and went that
nerd
I really regret writing that but it
isn&#39;t just with Leland&#39;s race gender and
age that we&#39;re defying expectations
we&#39;re also defying expectations when it
comes to demographics now
Leland&#39;s character brought together
demographics that are very rarely seen
Gen Xers Baby Boomers and Millennials
all together let&#39;s put it this way right
the news is an old person&#39;s game raise
your hand if you watch news on TV okay
so you watch news on TV
what&#39;s your name Maya okay and how old
are you Maya sixteen okay and what news
program do you watch on TV Maya you&#39;re a
liar
Millennials consume all their news
through the internet through Wi-Fi
enabled fidgets spinners 60 percent of
Australians aged between 18 and 24
consume all their news online through
Facebook and Twitter websites like that
and 64 percent of Australians aged 25 to
34 do the exact same thing so you
thought I was being an asshole with that
fidget spin online
I was but I have the facts to back it up
and the thing with the with the new
school of comedy as well is the old
people don&#39;t really watch it but when we
were providing them with a character
from a personality that they&#39;d seen on
their TV for 28 years the older
generations Millennials and Gen Xers
would soon into the feed and they&#39;d see
Leland&#39;s character and then they&#39;d stick
around and then they&#39;d see the stories
and reports and documentaries that the
feed made from our perspective from the
millennial perspective they would see
the stories that mattered to us marriage
equality wealth disparity that type of
thing and it may not have changed their
minds but it was getting them involved
in the side of the conversation that
they wouldn&#39;t normally see on mainstream
media and conversely the same thing
happened with the news Millennials would
watch these sketches mainly online and
then tune in to watch Leland read the
news admittedly it was to see what
outfit she&#39;d be wearing but let&#39;s face
it they&#39;re fucking awesome and the thing
is that&#39;s really important in today&#39;s
world of fake news 40% of Australians
don&#39;t trust the mainstream media anymore
we&#39;re switching off and instead we&#39;re
turning to comedians to inform us we&#39;re
turning to people like Seth Meyers
Samantha bee and an Australia Charlie
Pickering and Shawn Micallef now these
comedians have agendas that they&#39;re
pushing but we know that they&#39;re being
open and
honest about it and that&#39;s one of the
reasons why Li Lin works because it&#39;s
combining those two things it&#39;s
combining the comedy and the news now
Leland&#39;s character is never political or
topical but you watch those sketches you
share a laugh with her and it humanizes
it humanizes her news broadcasts then
the news broadcast feeds into the comedy
because it&#39;s so absurd that a respected
newsreader would be doing these stupid
little sketches and you know that&#39;s kind
of why that character worked so well
what on earth are you talking about
little man God Leland I mean miss chin
what are you doing here I don&#39;t need you
saving this TEDx talk this TEDx talk
does not need saving these guys are
liking it they&#39;re not liking it do my
intro no Leland I don&#39;t need you to come
out right now
do my intro I met Leland four years ago
and she made me memorize this
introduction in case she ever wanted to
interrupt a speech of mine in the four
years we&#39;ve known her she&#39;s interrupted
every speech so ladies and gentlemen
please rise no seriously I&#39;m gonna need
you to get the fuck up
everybody rise if you are not on your
feet when Leland comes out we will all

[Applause]
do you dig my groovy strikes you guys

Sydney TEDx youth Sydney Leyland gin
thank you and hello
Teddy&#39;s could you put a photo of me up
on the screen again please yeah sure and
preferably a sexy one Oh perfect the sex
robots look Li Lin um look I really
appreciate your coming out but I&#39;m I
don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re doing here
well there&#39;s a very good reason I&#39;m here
okay
you&#39;ve been bleating on about teaching
these impressionable children how to
turn a newsreader
into a comedy star yes which by the way
I don&#39;t think is a particularly useful a
lucrative skill look at you
you still live with your parents that is
not true but so far you&#39;ve just talked
about representation and demographics
yeah those things are important to know
and boring
and what small those are just things
directors like you say all the time to
make yourself sound like you know what
you&#39;re doing and we obviously don&#39;t we
both know that look at you
you dressed like an extra from the Lost
Boys Leland that is a terrible reference
these guys are Millennials they have not
seen that movie be that as it may it&#39;s
still si si kb u RN sick burn okay cool
and you are completely missing the point
okay I&#39;m saying yes sex race age of
sexual appetite to rival Hugh Hefner&#39;s
that&#39;s not why people connected with my
character why do they they connected
because of me it was me it is me all of
me no one else matters okay that&#39;s not
really cool Leland excuse me look you
come here and you ruin my TEDx talk you
make it all about you I was just about
to get to the end I was gonna get my big
finale out where I brought everything to
it together explained this talk you mean
you&#39;re really proud of the beach where
you say the best way to turn the news
reader into a comedy star your is to
give the audience something they weren&#39;t
expecting yep
or would otherwise not expect to see or
hear yeah that&#39;s your being
but that doesn&#39;t mean like my wording
but I get that you&#39;re stuck on the
script that&#39;s fine yes
uh and that&#39;s your big revelation but
let me tell you regrettably in today&#39;s
society that is anyone who is a minority
a part of the LGBTQ eye community over
fifty years of age or a woman in a lead
role that is either derogatory
stereotypical or in questionable taste
yep at a loss for words what what she
said that um that&#39;s the it&#39;s the end of
my TED talk she finished it
my name is is Chris Leben and you guys
have been great and I&#39;ve been the
lynching and you&#39;ve been most welcome
come back here little man sorry sorry
Lillian I forgot
