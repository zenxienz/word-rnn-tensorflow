well what&#39;s so special for me about
being in Armenia so this is my third
visit to this country and just looking
around seeing the technology seeing the
ecosystem seeing the Entrepreneurship it
really really makes me smile and this is
my first day in a week spending here so
we&#39;re doing all sorts of things this
week we&#39;re going to the hive tech
conference we&#39;re running a half-marathon
we&#39;re meeting people we&#39;re seeing the
energy of the country which couldn&#39;t
make me any more proud and as I look
around and see all the different things
that are going on I can&#39;t help but think
what is the technology ecosystem of
Armenia gonna look like over the next 20
years where are we going what are we
doing and there&#39;s no better way to
understand this by looking at the
history of Technology and looking at the
history and how that potentially can
shape the future of Technology going
forward from a global perspective so
Andy Grove was the founder and CEO of
Intel and he wrote a very very famous
book called only the paranoid survive
and in this book which he wrote in 1996
there was one very very very clear
message and this clear message is around
strategic inflection points and what are
strategic inflection points so what you
see here is a strategic inflection point
it&#39;s that moment in a business around
technology that everything can change
everything can either rapidly innovate
and rapidly grow or everything can
quickly disintegrate and quickly go down
the drain and for me this is a really
really really interesting concept I&#39;m a
computer enthusiast I&#39;ve studied the
history of technology and you know I
love my gadgets and always thinking
about these things trying to get my
hands on all the different books around
this and I look at this and I look back
and think about the last 50 years
and whatever the last 50 years looked
like in technology what have been the
inflection point of these last 50 years
and as I take a step back I realize
every 10 years there&#39;s a new inflection
point and that inflection point shapes
the next 20 years so if you look back at
every decade since the 70s there&#39;s one
inflection point that scientists and
engineers and business people iterate on
iterate on iterate on and then suddenly
there&#39;s a huge change in the uplift of
technology and it completely changes the
way that computers software and humans
interact with these computers and what
the really interesting thing right now
in 2017 as we look at it is there are
three inflection points and you&#39;ve heard
a little bit about this sprinkled
throughout the conversations today I&#39;m
in the early discussions but there are
three inflection points that I believe
in 2017 will shape the next 20 years of
computing through 2037 and potentially
have a big impact in this country and
other other global economies around the
world so let&#39;s take a trip back to
nineteen to the 1970s so there was a
very interesting inflection point in the
1970s at that time my mom and dad were
in university at the American University
of Beirut and they told me all these
stories around this change that happened
when these giant giant giant computers
or calculators in an essence at the time
because the function was so limited
started moving from what was happening
in these giant labs to people&#39;s homes
and people&#39;s workplaces and this shift
was a big shift in paradigm and how they
people thought of computers from being a
big big science project that only exists
in a lab to something that you could
actually use in your home or in the
workplace and because of this people
started becoming a lot more imaginative
what can you do with computers how can
you think about computers and these
computers were very very different than
the computers that we think about now
and they were very very different in one
way there were one vertically integrated
stack which all worked together and
didn&#39;t interact with anything didn&#39;t
interact with the outside world didn&#39;t
interact with outside programs just all
interacted with themselves so that was a
very very interesting inflection point
in that computing finally came to the
home and to the work so what happened
next
so in the 1980s a guy named Bill Gates
invented Windows and Windows was a very
very big inflection point for software
and how people thought about software
suddenly an application ecosystem was
built where people who created software
and were third parties not interacting
directly with the company that created
the hardware could build businesses
could build economies could do something
completely different that had nothing to
do with the hardware that was being
created so these vertically integrated
computers from the 70s became machines
that ran other people&#39;s software&#39;s and
you started people doing different
seeing people do different things people
were playing games people were writing
books through word processors people
were writing notes people were doing all
sorts of different things I&#39;ll never
forget running over to a friend&#39;s house
when I just moved to America in the 80s
and seeing these computers playing chess
on them having drawing applications
editing photos and it was a clear change
computers and software worked together
Windows brought this opportunity of
bringing people who are creating
applications and bringing them onto
computers and it seems so simple now but
this was a massive massive inflection
point software from third parties works
with hardware with other entities that
are creating it and this inflection
point shaped the next 20 years as you&#39;re
gonna see now so what was next what was
the next big inflection point of the 90s
well in the 90s the internet was really
born from a consumer perspective in the
US
we all were sent these little AOL discs
that we ended up loading into our
computers and which dialed up through
modem and that modem connected us to
that world wide web and suddenly you had
hardware which was the computer you had
the software ecosystem that ran the
software and then it connected to all
the different sites on the web and now
this seems obvious and this seems so
simple but if you look at that point we
had a very very very clear inflection
point at that time we at a point in time
where you could connect computers to
other computers and that had never
happened before until this point and
there were no numerous companies coming
out around this there was copies sort of
prodigy AOL enabling these channels and
pipes to connect computer to computer to
computer and with that the applications
and the third-party applications that
were originally created for Windows all
moved online to the applications of the
web and from there you got Google and
you got Yahoo and you got Amazon and all
these countries were companies were born
in the 90s in the early 2000s based on
this key inflection point that computers
could now be connected to each other
that never had happened before and
because of this some massive massive
businesses were created so what&#39;s the
next natural inflection point well this
happened and you know in the early days
of Hollywood this is what we envisioned
the mobile device to look like right
you&#39;re watching Saved by the Bell and
Zack Morris has a giant head phone it&#39;s
attached to him you&#39;re watching Michael
Douglas in the movie Wall Street and
he&#39;s got a giant phone where he&#39;s
walking down the beach and talking on it
and people thought these phones are just
a way to talk to each other and these
are just a continuation of what happens
in the house well another inflection
point was upon us and suddenly these
phones started becoming computing
devices in a very very different type of
computing devices and just like you saw
for the computers that started
in their initial enterprises and in the
homes these computers were limited and
what they could do and a lot of times
located just on the on the phone that it
was on and they started with email and
they started with ability to text and
little by little you were able to do
more and more and more and the initial
blackberry found a Trojan horse into the
big financial institutions who all
wanted to use these devices to
communicate quickly and always beyond
write these financial investment bankers
are working 110 hours a week they always
needed to be on and suddenly there was a
golden use case for all of these devices
to work so then what happened the iPhone
was born and what was very very
interesting about the iPhone was wasn&#39;t
the first generation iPhone so the
iPhone was initially launched in 2007
and when the iPhone launched it was a
vertically integrated piece of hardware
and because of that every single app was
curated by Apple and every single piece
of content on there was not from a
third-party app ecosystem until the
second iPhone in 2008 and this caused a
major inflection point an app ecosystem
was created developers from all over the
world were able to create apps that were
connected to their phones and these apps
were constantly using the hardware of
the phone the camera the sensors the GPS
all of that stuff that felt so intuitive
completely changed and we had an
inflection point right there and they&#39;re
taking a picture on Facebook and
immediately seeing it uploaded and
showing up on your social network was a
massive massive aha moment for everyone
then 2008 seemed like the most amazing
thing which now ten years later just
seems like the most mundane and
simplified
simplified things businesses like
snapchat Twitter Instagram all only
existed because they were mobile and
they use the device and the sensors on
mobile and that changed everything
decisively for that inflection point so
now we&#39;re at 2017 you look at the last
50 years you&#39;ve seen all these
inflection points like I said every ten
years one new inflection point 70s 80s
90s 2000s now so what&#39;s happening now
what are the things everyone&#39;s hearing
about and what are the inflection points
well there&#39;s three big inflection points
right now artificial intelligence is
growing and it&#39;s taking up everywhere in
our lives
artificial reality and virtual reality
augmented reality and virtual reality
which we call XR is coming and
blockchain is coming so let me dig into
each of these and explain how and why
they&#39;ll be the inflection point of the
future as we think about 2037 so man
falls in love with his computer and the
computer talks to himself computer
becomes the most important person in his
life if any of you saw the movie her had
the actor had a headset and all he was
doing is talking to his computer and the
computer got smarter and smarter on
exactly what his owner wanted she would
say all sorts of different things from
telling him where to go what to do how
to plan for your life so right now the
way that you&#39;re seeing artificial
intelligence is primarily in bots and
how BOTS interact with all the users you
see it on Facebook you see it on Google
you see all these different places where
people ask something somewhat somewhat
in something and it comes back to him
restaurant recommendation TV shows
what should I do at this time what&#39;s the
weather like this is the initial point
of artificial intelligence and
eventually all of this is going to
superimpose the world around us every
piece of clothing every item of
furniture is gonna have some artificial
intelligence layer that&#39;s gonna be able
to interact with you and make it
possible to know exactly what you want
when do you want it now do we know what
that killer application is gonna be no
no one knew when Facebook was gonna come
no one knew what Google was gonna come
we knew there was a very very very
clearance
point and that inflection point was that
computers were connected to each other
and that was going to enable an
application ecosystem that was going to
be built upon it and artificial
intelligence is going to do just this
all the items around you are going to
know what you are doing and are going to
learn through machine learning exactly
how you should do them what you should
do be doing it what time you should be
doing it it will touch everything from
people&#39;s dating lives to people&#39;s
cooking habits to people&#39;s eating habits
to people&#39;s enterprise have it
everything so that&#39;s inflection point
one so what&#39;s the next inflection point
so about a year ago a year and a half
ago I went on summer vacation when out
of a beautiful beach vacation was
completely disconnected with the world
everyone needs to do that it&#39;s good for
the mind and body and I came back a week
later I hadn&#39;t been reading any other
tech press articles hadn&#39;t been doing
any of that stuff and I come back and
this is happening people are running
around the world trying to catch Pokemon
and within a week everyone is chasing
Pokemon with their phones and I have no
idea that this is happening and I have
no idea why people are literally pulling
up in the middle of the road jumping out
into a park and gathering around an
imaginary surface where nothing in my
mind exists but apparently some rare and
valuable Pokemon creature exists that
they&#39;re trying to catch and this was
really the first point that augmented
reality started to take shape an
augmented reality and virtual reality
kind of live in the same family they are
content which are Holograms and taking
you to a place that doesn&#39;t exist or
bringing you a place that does exist and
what you&#39;re going to start seeing within
the next inflection point around content
and interactions is the mass consumption
of augmented reality and virtual reality
I personally would love to see what
North Korea looks like I can&#39;t go to
North Korea for a number of different
reasons but it&#39;s a reversal reality
headset I can put that on and I could
see exactly what&#39;s going on
I would love to go to a museum that&#39;s in
the other side of the world no idea how
to get there it&#39;s cost inhibitive put on
a VR headset I&#39;m a doctor
who wants to serve and help a patient
who&#39;s on the other side of the world
with a rare disease virtual reality can
put it put it on you&#39;ll have haptic
feedback you&#39;ll have ways to see the
world in that operating room add this
with documented reality put these two
things together and you&#39;ve got X R which
gives you the next world of experiences
shopping will be changed retail will
show up in your in your house or
apartment your favorite store your
favorite department store suddenly is
that Pokemon environment where you&#39;re
able to purchase and you&#39;re able to see
everything around you you&#39;re you can
bring the world to you and that is an
inflection point over the next 20 years
is going to change everything and right
now these headsets and these augmented
reality experiences are somewhat
difficult and somewhat clunky but
through Moore&#39;s Law they&#39;ll get faster
easier and you&#39;ll have that ah-ha
smartphone iPhone moment where people
are all using it because that ideal
form-factor moving from blackberry to
the smartphone of iPhone and Android
will happen and you&#39;ll have a mass
consumption app ecosystem that&#39;s built
on top of it just like you did with the
phones so what&#39;s the last inflection
point and how is this all going to be
tied together blockchain so what is
blockchain
you&#39;re hearing it over and over and over
again but at the core of blockchain is
this it&#39;s just a system of Ledger&#39;s it&#39;s
a system of interconnected computers
that allow you to do checks and balances
bank decides that it wants to pay client
you don&#39;t need to have the booking
system movie wants to put DRM on a TV
show you don&#39;t need to put do the
digital encryption that&#39;s going on now
you&#39;re at the grocery store and you want
to get a receipt and you want to do that
transaction and the credit transaction
you don&#39;t have to go through the credit
card transaction anymore and go through
the financial institutions it&#39;s a system
of checks and balances that will put at
everything in place and it has
applicability to everything from
self-driving cars to shopping to
entertainment and to financial
institutions right now everyone hears
about Bitcoin and aetherium and all
these initial coin offerings but that&#39;s
the below barrier of entry because it
makes sense with financial institutions
but any place where one transaction has
to happen will eventually have
blockchain and it will be decentralized
it will be all over the world it will be
computers connected all over the world
and it will be people transacting all
over the world so we&#39;re at a very very
very interesting point of time right now
these three inflection points are
actually all happening at the exact same
time and if you think about modern
computing and the technology platforms
that were built each of them happened
independently over a course of ten year
periods and they impacted 20 years going
forward so I stand here now in Yerevan
in Armenia and I think about all the
different things that are happening in
technology here and I think about the
apps that are being built in this
building I think about all the startups
then we&#39;re gonna meet this week and all
the interesting things that&#39;s things
that are happening and I think about
these three inflection points so first
if you think about artificial
intelligence the number one most
important thing around artificial
intelligence is machine learning and big
data and from everything that I hear and
everything that I see around Yerevan in
the technology ecosystem this is a
precisely a place of expertise for the
people and the engineers here so there&#39;s
a massive massive opportunity to play a
big role in this artificial intelligence
ecosystem second augmented reality and
virtual reality I view our mented and
reality and virtual reality very very
similar to the smartphone in that there
will be a massive application ecosystem
that will be built on top of augmented
reality and virtual reality platforms
and one of the other strengths of what&#39;s
going on here in Armenia is the app
developers that are that are being born
here and building third-party
for people in the US people in other
countries countless times do I hear
us-based companies coming to Armenia to
look for development talent to build
apps it happens over and over and over
again now if we can harness that
expertise to build apps here and have
the IP here there&#39;s a massive
opportunity around augmented reality and
virtual reality in the 20 years going
forward third and finally blockchain why
is Armenia so well position in Bock
Jayne well blockchain is ultimately
going to be driven by emerging economies
that will thrive on being decentralized
and not being where all the central
banks that control the global economy
are meaning where there is engineering
talent and where there&#39;s computing power
there&#39;s a big opportunity for blockchain
here in Armenia Yerevan so as I think
about these strengths through these
things here&#39;s what I&#39;d leave you with
and here&#39;s this here&#39;s an idea that I
leave you with there&#39;s a lot of
professionals students professors
scientists here in the audience and in
this country
please start thinking about how you can
think about these three inflection
points strategically think about the
next 20 years and how you can position
yourself in the right way to have the
expertise to minute to give Armenia a
competitive advantage for this finally
so the people who have influence in
Armenia to the government to the
corporation&#39;s to everyone else commit
their resources so that techni talent
can grow and the right strategy can be
built here in this country to take
advantage of these three massive massive
market opportunities that will take 20
years to develop and are at the Nason
sea of their development so I&#39;ll leave
you with that thank you for having me
and
you
