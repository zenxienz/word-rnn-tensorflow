good morning I start with a question and
I thought can anyone tell me what this
is what type of box good I think we got
the first point right so um I didn&#39;t
really know how to approach my talk to
start with so I thought I would bring a
friend
so black box and I have been friends for
almost 16 years from the very beginning
of my university time to my time in the
United States from aerospace to
automotive and for those of you well
that don&#39;t really know they&#39;re not very
exposed to software engineering my job
is a my my main job is software testing
and one of the technical terms in
software testing is black box testing so
you have your own system your black box
you stimulate it with whatever input and
you just look at the output and but you
have no idea you cannot the rule of the
game is that you have no idea what&#39;s
inside and sometimes it&#39;s something else
people think that since I&#39;ve been
working with the with highly
technological objects helicopters and
sports cars that innovation is right
there ready for me to access it live in
it and actually it is true so today I
want to take you on this journey to show
you what is inside that box and to take
you to the other side of the on all the
way to them at the pot of gold so first
of all let me tell you what innovation
is it might be obvious to you but
innovation is basically the concept of
introducing anything near it could be a
process it could be a new system it
could be a new product it could be
anything actually but it doesn&#39;t write
it doesn&#39;t really come like a light bulb
moment you don&#39;t really wake up have
your coffee and they&#39;re your innovation
it doesn&#39;t work like that
so usually innovation comes whenever you
have different elements that together
they just joined to each other smoothly
and and then you can turn on the light
so I used to I use this analogy of the
four pillars of innovation and I used
them as a team the workplace the product
and the metal itself and let me call
this four elements the rainbow of
innovation if this is still not very
clear to you just a bit up in the air
concept let me use a graphical example I
love art and I love money
Monet together with the other
Impressionists basically change art and
there is a reason why we still enjoy
their exhibitions that we just go to the
rare painting we might have their
background our on our phone because in
the end they were innovative but let&#39;s
see if the four elements actually work
with money and the Impressionists first
of all the team what money was is one of
those but I&#39;m sure you might know money
Renoir Suzanne van Gogh and the work
place
well they used to hang around Paris
Paris was the place to be to to
basically run this revolution around
painting the product the product was
imagine that you you have one day and
you paint about the king the Queen a
very static element and then one day the
next day you just look at your your your
work of art is just a glimpse like an
impression and the impression will
change every day you look at the same
scene it would be always be different
and the method
well you look from
the Renaissance painters and then you
look at Monet and the actual technique
is completely different you go with
thick brushes very at the first sight
very imprecise but they deliver this
impression so how does all this mean
what does it mean what can you take back
home I&#39;m sure you will not just go and
around and paint whence means there you
will not go to Paris but you can surely
find the elements of the rainbow every
time you go and do your things you live
your life so I would just go together
with you I will just go back to the four
pillars so the first pillar the team and
I will describe to you the four pillars
through four stories personal stories so
the first pillar the team I call it the
yellow pillar my favorite color so then
the story around the the the team pillar
is that goes back to my mentoring time
here I am going I had the amazing
opportunity to be mentored at work and I
wanted to become a better manager and so
I go like I want to do this I want to do
that I want to learn not to deal with
people and then I have my mentor in
front of me just eat grab a pen and drew
this rectangle on a piece of paper and
he asked me who do you think you are in
this rectangle like I don&#39;t know so I&#39;m
not going to take you on the six-month
mentoring
today but like a summary she said the
rectangle is a typical and easy way to
describe a team you might have the
extroverted people at the corner they
are ready for a change they look for a
change they have you have the
introverted people right in the middle
they are just comfortable and without
external noise and then you have the
team manager that actually hits his or
her own role is to grab the corners make
them bigger bigger and bigger so you
hear very often this idea of thinking
outside of the box you need to design
box before you get outside second pillar
the workplace the blue pillar the story
behind this is just my one day at work
for me so every day I go for lunch like
nothing crazy about this nothing special
but the I&#39;m lucky that every time I go
for lunch I walk by the trophies so um
[Music]
nothing no not every day you you have
everything amazing at work something
might go wrong you might have blocking
points here and there but it&#39;s
constantly good to just go back and
remember what you have done well what
you celebrate how you want in the past
in the present and then if you pick on
the habit what happens in the future
before I even go for lunch I need to get
to work so then the other element that
is beautiful is the way I go from my the
cycle rack to my desk it&#39;s a completely
white corridor and it&#39;s amazing how that
structure allows me to just leave behind
all the stress all the anger all the bad
feelings that I had before work and
allow me to concentrate ready to go to
perform at my desk to do hopefully good
cars in my case but it could be anything
the third pillar the product so I call
it the the right pillar another story so
like my job as a software tester is just
to I&#39;m imagining that I am sitting there
in front of my test bench and cover
surrounded by wires and stuff my job is
to find bugs in the software and
potentially could be really boring so I
had to find the beauty behind what I do
every day so and so I was looking for my
inspiration one day I
in discussing at the coffee machine and
the I&#39;ve been told that our vehicles are
inspired by animals and my own wow
that&#39;s cool and and so so then I was
looking so where is the shark where is
the animal what am I looking for and so
since that point on every time I look at
the car and every time there is a new
product coming into the pipeline I&#39;m
just dreaming about the the new animal
that&#39;s what I do that you can see it in
a front light you can see anywhere else
you can see in the profile of the car
and it&#39;s just beautiful you it just
creates that element of excitement for
what is coming next the fourth pillar
the metal so like I ran out of primary
colors so I just use purple as a good
combination of the blue and the red and
a complementary color for compared to
the first pillar and the story the story
behind the method is about passion so
every single product every single
business goes through the same similar
process from the very beginning to the
delivery of the product you just can
break it down in macro faces the very
initial phase the concept then you need
to grab that idea bring it down to
something real and then in the amazing
world and the idea world everything
works perfectly it&#39;s not really the case
so you need to then start to fix the
problems and test test test test test so
my job is in the last part and my
passion is in there so I do not function
whenever I need to come up with a new
conceptual part I do like to have the
broken puzzle put it together so how
does that apply to me it&#39;s like at work
Here I am again in front of the same
test environment and one day I had to
create to build this automatic driving
scenario that then my computer will do
themselves
so I ran I went around the company and I
asked one single question in
you go to your car what would be the
very first thing that you do people tell
me all different things they would pair
the phone that would turn on the radio
they will wrap the engine and this lady
that was amazing she said that the very
first thing that she would she would do
is to check to the checker makeup in the
rearview mirror like okay awesome so
then I completely that completely turn
inside out what I would do and how I
would design my testing and so from that
point on i every time i just do my daily
work i just apply my passion to walk the
customer that everyone would do would
use the product so this is I close it
here so so what I want what I wish for
you to just go home and do is just to
look for your makeup story
find your cheetahs and find your sharks
build your trophies and design your
white tunnel and most importantly look
for your box so before I go I just
wanted to show you what&#39;s inside my
little friend rainbows
so my wish for you is that from today
onwards whenever there will be a rainbow
in the sky you will look at it from a
different perspective thank you
[Applause]
