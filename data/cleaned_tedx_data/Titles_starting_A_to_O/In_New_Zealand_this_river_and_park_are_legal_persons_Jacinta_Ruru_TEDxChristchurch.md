tena koutou nama he so in the law of New
Zealand in July 2014 the beautiful to
Oda wadda a national park transformed
into a legal person with its own rights
responsibilities duties and liabilities
our Lord did it again three years later
and March 2017 a country&#39;s longest third
longest river the fungal nui river
became a legal person so for mardi the
first peoples to discover and make these
lands their homes that I&#39;ve always seen
personality in these lands between donna
nui our sky father and papa Tanuku our
earth mother it&#39;s pretty cool that our
state legal system now recognizes the
personality and our lands and waters too
so my research argues that colonial
countries including altered or New
Zealand must address and must find new
ways to respectfully connect with
indigenous peoples and as part of that
we need to examine reconstruct the
foundations of our society and our legal
system legal personality shows us one of
the ways to do this it&#39;s an incredible
moment for us here and out here at our
New Zealand and it offers a solution for
many countries around the world to
disrupt centuries of racism and bias so
here in Ontario in New Zealand the
Europeans first started arriving in
these lanes and little very late 1700s
and in 1840 started to make these lands
their homes
and accordance with the treaty of
waitangi an agreement between the
British crown and the Mahdi tribes about
how to live together here in Ontario in
New Zealand together respectfully but
it&#39;s only recently that our government
are starting to make true those
opportunities and our Treaty of Waitangi
and legal personality has been born as
part of this new commitment to
reconciliation legal personality offers
us an incredible moment to transform our
understanding our appreciation of all
that is around us and to give us a Mardi
understanding of the world or in the
words of Sir Peter Sharples the then
Minister of Maori affairs and 2014 he
said legal personality offers us a
profound alternative to the human
presumption of sovereignty over nature
so it&#39;s amazing that legal personality
has been bound and done here and I&#39;ll
tear down New Zealand this is something
that for many years I argued should
happen here in New Zealand I didn&#39;t
actually expect it to happen so soon and
if we could do it here and I&#39;ll taro in
New Zealand
anyone can so why do I care my dad was
brought up in the North Island and the
and his dad&#39;s tribal lands of Roe Kawa
Nix door to the humble family Papa Ramu
Matt I and my mum parkia European was
brought up to the west of dead and her
beloved city of New Plymouth I was
brought up in the deep south and
glenorchy at the head of Lake Wakatipu
at the foot of the majestic mountains
law at the long side the beautiful
braided dart river at the bottom and
surrounded by the Fiordland
Nash
park the mount aspiring national park
places managed by our Department of
Conservation a government department
that manages one-third of our country&#39;s
lands and waters but something seemed a
mess and remus wasn&#39;t I also living at
the head of a sleeping giant wasn&#39;t I
also living on the boat where Maori
stood to stand in fish what the park yo
Europeans call the North Island wasn&#39;t
tight also standing and living at the at
the entry to the most important Mardi
resource and the Marty economy pounamu
centuries of trade that took place there
but none of this was evident and the
naming of the landscapes around me and
very little of it was taught to me and
my school curriculum and so I dreamed
for new ways for us to understand as
many Maori families across alta√Ør
dollar New Zealand have been fighting
hard for since 1840 and so I fell under
the discipline of law gosh law law is a
difficult subject ed as a hard
discipline it is hostile to indigenous
peoples it has been used as the tool to
still criminalize confiscate Marty lanes
and Marty knowledge but legal
personality disrupts thus and gives us
another opportunity so what is legal
personality so you and I and law we
regard it as natural persons as natural
persons we have our own rights and
responsibilities the law also looks to
and has created other entities to have
legal personality and for example
incorporated companies is a really good
example of that around the world
companies have been regarded as
legal personality what we have done here
in altero in New Zealand is a world
first as recognized that legal
personality can stretch too and go to
our environment now the idea really
first started to generate in the Western
context in the 1970s an America
professor Christopher stone wrote a book
should trees have standing and he
proceeded to answer that question by
saying the oceans the fish the
environment all around us should have a
voice in the court should be able to
stand and have a right to be heard and
legal proceedings but here in Altera
Dahl in New Zealand we haven&#39;t created
legal personality of a once National
Park and a still long river for
environmental protection to her widow
was a national park that had the that
has the highest level of environmental
protection offered in our legal system
national parks must be preserved and
perpetuity for future generations so
we&#39;ve used legal personality here in
Ontario and New Zealand to do something
more and Bettis to recognize and to
reconnect with an indigenous world view
of this place and it is incredible that
it has been born from the heartache and
struggle to create these opportunities
to disrupt the racism in our society so
to our wieder
as a place and Fung an OE river as a
river and those lands and waters
atrocities took place and a still and
more recent years have been taking place
so interior de Widder it&#39;s a place where
mean woman and children have been killed
it is a place where scorched earth
policies have been used to destroy Mardy
homes and
Harden&#39;s it&#39;s where Maori have been
criminalized it&#39;s where Marty have been
their ways of knowing and their
knowledge have been taken from them and
the wrongs of the past of the wrongs of
the present - and 2007 just ten years
ago 300 armed police we tend to to adore
water on allegations of terrorism
preparation camps no one was found
guilty of terrorism preparation camps
despite the horrors of those days so
legal personality has been born as part
of our Treaty of Waitangi settlements
opportunities to connect and to make
right to start to make right those
wrongs of our past so what does the law
do to our weather Act of 2014 I think
it&#39;s the most beautifully written
statute ever and so while I do not
routinely encourage the reading of
legislation for joy those as perhaps one
exception so total weirdo reads to the
widow as ancient and enduring and is
alive with history it is abundant with
scenery it has its own spirituality it
is has its own authority it has its own
life force and for - hoy the people who
come from - de Widder who know - it
aware a beast
for - hi - ooh door wetter as the heart
of that great fish that Mar we hit court
and to eat a wetter as important for all
of us as New Zealanders it is prized by
us all the funginner a river is likewise
the 2017 legislation describes this as
an ancestor of the funginner a people it
is an indivisible whole it is physical
and metaphysical from the mountains to
the sea so this is something I think we
ought to be incredibly proud of here in
all t8o in New Zealand other countries
starting to do this to the Ganges River
and India the Colorado River and America
people&#39;s there are trying to argue for
legal personality there but perhaps
that&#39;s in the context of environmental
protection here and I&#39;ll tear dollar New
Zealand must be understood as being born
and the context of our treaty of
waitangi settlements quite helpfully
legal personality neutralizes a hot
topic of ownership that neutralizes the
debate around Crown ownership and Marty
ownership these places are their own
persons they own themselves so what does
Tudor we&#39;re to do we&#39;re three years on
now from that incredible statute in 2014
here we now have mostly to high caring
for and nourishing this place but with
some department of conservation persons
involved too we now have a new language
for how one interacts and appreciates
and loves this place the rules no longer
at the year to manage the land they&#39;re
there to manage us is people the
management plan for Tudor whether that&#39;s
just been released in the last few
months reads and begins deliberatively
we are seeking to reset our human
relationship and behavior with nature a
disconnection from te de Widder has
changed our humaneness we wish for its
return
are the words of to hoist and this is
really my message with own Marti
societies they have many solutions deep
knowledge --is for all of us as a
country to better reconnect and to
better know where we come from and as
part of this our country has enabled
thus through legal personality showing
us that we can imagine new foundations
for our society so I think back to where
I was brought up that sleeping giant and
lake wakatipu maybe one day we might
recognize that place as having legal
personality to but please only if the
peoples who know that story beast nighta
who wish for us to do otherwise would be
to repeat centuries decades of colonial
displacement of indigenous stories and
dizziness knowledge as from place so I
believe we come from the land land water
one MODY order
