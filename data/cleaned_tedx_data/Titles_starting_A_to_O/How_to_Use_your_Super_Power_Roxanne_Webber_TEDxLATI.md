all right hello everybody are you guys
having fun
we&#39;re gonna have a lot of fun okay all
right first of all I want to tell you a
little about myself I am by education a
political scientist by profession I&#39;m a
software engineer don&#39;t ask me how that
happened but it did I love to learn I
always have I imagine you guys are
probably the same and I love to go
hiking canoeing and camping especially
with my beautiful American Eskimo I love
this dog
this dog is amazing he is attentive he
listens to me
follows me around does what I ask him to
do you can even do tricks it&#39;s pretty
awesome you know come to think of it I
kind of wish young people were a lot
like my dog you know I&#39;ve got three
young adult children myself so I know
what I&#39;m talking about here
have you guys noticed that young people
these days they are rude they don&#39;t pay
attention they got their nose and their
phone all the time right have you ever
noticed this right as young people I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ve seen it right all right they
they just don&#39;t pay attention to what&#39;s
going on in the world I I just you know
come to think of it they kind of are
like my dog because they&#39;re waiting for
every meal right they sit around asking
for treats and if you don&#39;t jump up
right away when they ask for something
they bark right so but basically I mean
let&#39;s be serious okay I mean we&#39;re all
from South Dakota we all kind of think
alike so we know that today&#39;s young
people are just inconsiderate they don&#39;t
pay attention to what&#39;s going on in the
world they don&#39;t care what&#39;s going on in
the world they don&#39;t want to learn
anything new and they just seem to not
want to be engaged in what&#39;s going on
it&#39;s really sad if you think about it
the way young people are today so now
before you boo me off the stage what
just happened
you just experienced firsthand bias and
I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve all experienced
this before maybe just not as blatantly
as me saying it right in front of you
but bias is the tendency to have a
perspective that you may not even
realize is a bias in fact a lot of
people&#39;s bias is so ingrained they don&#39;t
even realize that they&#39;re doing it at
the time and not only do they not
realize that they&#39;re doing it but to
them it&#39;s true so young people stink
right I know it&#39;s true because I have
three young adults and I&#39;ve seen it
firsthand so that means all you folks
are the same you all are stinking young
people who don&#39;t care about the world so
let&#39;s just talk about this bias for a
minute shall we what is it really
well I mentioned before that it&#39;s kind
of an ingrained process it comes from
your growing up how your family members
treated you the friends you had when you
were in school whether you were bullied
whether you weren&#39;t bullied it depends
on a lot of different factors but as
you&#39;re growing up it can become so
ingrained that you don&#39;t even realize
that you&#39;re doing it so why does this
matter well first of all let&#39;s just talk
about some historic biased incidences I
guess you could call it there in the
1600s there&#39;s a group called the giddy
multitude and basically what they were
is they were a low lower class of
society they were farmers they didn&#39;t
like their lot in life and they were
starting to wonder if maybe they
shouldn&#39;t do something about it so now
if you&#39;re a southern plantation owner
how do you handle a near-riot
or rebellion in the lower classes
there&#39;s clearly more of them than there
are of you so what do you do to contain
it well one idea is to bring over a
bunch of people from another country
nobody&#39;s heard of who look different and
talk different and then you introduce
them to society and you say you see
these people are different than you
therefore they deserve
whatever they get because they&#39;re not
worth it they&#39;re not real people they
don&#39;t look like you they don&#39;t talk like
you they don&#39;t act like you so now what
you&#39;ve done is introduced a systemic
bias that even to this day most people
believe is still the root of a lot of
our problems this one probably doesn&#39;t
need a lot of explanation I&#39;m sure you
recognize what we&#39;ve got going on here
so you take a society that&#39;s already
really in a bad place economically and
politically you add an extremist leader
who believes there should be one race
superior you subtract Free Press and you
add billions of propaganda messages all
across the world and what you end up
with is millions of innocent lives dying
because of one man&#39;s belief in a
systemic bias you know this this goes
for us today as well if you think about
what&#39;s going on in media and in the
press they&#39;ve always had a lot of power
if you will to influence how we think
and how we how we feel about things but
today we&#39;ve got social media and it
spreads like wildfire right
so think about recent events if you
probably heard that the Russians are
being accused of having in tried to
influence our thoughts and feelings with
propaganda with social media advertising
that didn&#39;t say one thing or another but
was almost worse
it&#39;s that both sides of the story
because it was trying to induce it was
trying to get us to fight with one
another so it was implementing stories
that were outrageous and outlandish but
for someone with a systemic bias seemed
pretty reasonable but now you got B
people on both sides thinking that these
extreme perspectives are real and you
could end up with a real problem can
you so what can we do to eliminate bias
clearly I&#39;m really good at insulting
young people in front of a roomful of
college students well what can we do
about it right I mean it seems like
we&#39;re all smart we should be able to
think of a way figure out a way to to
eliminate this bias well the reality is
there is no way to eliminate bias if
you&#39;re human you have bias and that&#39;s
not necessarily a bad thing
in fact bias is our brains way of
shortcutting so that we can protect
ourselves so I&#39;ll give you an example
remember when you were a toddler while
you may or may not I don&#39;t know it was
it was not as long for you guys as it
was for me remember when you were a
toddler and you saw the pretty red
burner right and you walked up to it and
you&#39;re like what is this it&#39;s so pretty
yeah it didn&#39;t take you long to realize
it wasn&#39;t so pretty right so now your
brain has created this short cut pretty
red burner means don&#39;t touch don&#39;t do it
all right
that&#39;s a bias we&#39;re not going to touch
anything that looks hot that&#39;s something
that&#39;s meant to protect us to protect
ourselves so what we have is a situation
in which our brain thinks that these
biases these perspectives are meant to
protect us so it becomes even more
difficult to get over them so now that
I&#39;ve given you all that gloom and doom
what can we do what can we do well what
we can do is we&#39;re gonna learn a new
superpower you guys like that idea yeah
oh come on yes yes we&#39;re going to learn
a new superpower and this superpower is
gonna give you the tool you need to be
able to help yourself
bring down that bias cuz everybody&#39;s got
it I mean you talk to anybody and oh
gosh those those darn red dogs they&#39;re
so annoying well do you know any red
dogs no why how do you know they&#39;re
annoying I know it right everybody&#39;s got
by
okay so we&#39;re gonna use this tool to
bring down our own bias and we&#39;re also
going to use it to change the world a
little at a time so it&#39;s very very easy
four simple steps alright first of all
and I&#39;m just going to tell you what the
steps are and then we&#39;ll start we&#39;re
going to envision a situation that is
really really upsets you second step
we&#39;re gonna say okay how angry on my
third step we&#39;re going to change that
perspective and fourth step we&#39;re gonna
see well
did my perspective change in how much
sounds easy right you guys ready are you
with me okay first thing I want you to
do if you have to close your eyes fine
but I want you to imagine a time some
something that&#39;s recent if you can maybe
me being up here being all nasty to
young people you could use that I want
to imagine the time where you are so
angry that you were like my gaskets
gonna blow I just can&#39;t believe maybe
you had a fight with your roommate maybe
had a fight with your parents or your
siblings or your teacher got up here and
said something you didn&#39;t like
I don&#39;t know they&#39;re probably in the
room so I got to be careful so anything
that just angered you to that point
where you were not sure how you could
ever imagine that situation in any
different way alright now I want to to
say though there&#39;s a lot of traumatic
events that people have had in their
lives all right a lot of them and if
it&#39;s a traumatic event that it&#39;s taken
you months to get over or that you never
want to think about again don&#39;t do this
now that&#39;s not don&#39;t do it now all right
this is not the time for that kind of
event but it is an event that that
angers you a lot all right so does
everybody have that event in their mind
okay now what I want you to imagine is
that this event was video recorded you
didn&#39;t know it and right now you can see
it on a television screen it&#39;s right in
front of you imagine one of the old
kinds with the frame around you guys are
kind of young but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen
pictures with the frame around the
television so this event is rolling in
front of you in front of your mind
now you guys probably won&#39;t remember
this but in my day there were little
knobs you had to turn you&#39;ve actually
had to get up and go over the
yeah you guys don&#39;t remember okay but
just imagine that there is a knob like a
radio knob well that&#39;s usually iPad but
you know a radio knob on this frame okay
now with this image in your mind if it
is in color if it&#39;s in color I want you
to see yourself turning that knob down
just a little bit so that the color of
the image turns black and white if
you&#39;re already seeing it in in black and
white I want you when the knob turns to
kind of make it fuzzy like kinda you are
and Miss mystic oh all right just turn
that knob a little bit now a lot of
people also will have things lined up in
their face they&#39;re like the the motion
and you see hands waving and you see
people going like this and if that&#39;s
what&#39;s going on when you turn that knob
I want you to pretend that you&#39;re gonna
view this image from a telescope or a
binocular you can still see it I don&#39;t
want you to go too far where you can&#39;t
see it but you can still see that image
but now it&#39;s much further away all right
now the next step is that if you&#39;re
hearing voices and you&#39;re hearing people
talking and you&#39;re hearing chaos in the
background when you turn that knob I
want you to imagine that voice those
voices getting really really soft you
can still hear it she can&#39;t hear it very
well okay now for some people there are
persons in our lives
you&#39;re so ingrained that even if we just
still see their mouth going like this we
can hear it even if we can&#39;t hear their
voice so if that&#39;s what&#39;s going on for
you then every time you see the mouths
move the mouth move I want to pretend
this is a little Mickey Mouse voice and
everybody&#39;s documenting Mickey Mouse
voice like this okay now thinking about
how angry you were when we first started
this exercise right how much better do
you feel now
no response it must have been a total
bust did it help
did it help okay so if that helped you
imagine now what you can do with this
tool to help yourself and to help others
so you hear somebody talking to someone
in a very nasty way and our first
instinct is to come to their defense in
two to get in broiled in this discussion
that probably isn&#39;t going to go anywhere
but instead if we can step back and see
the our perspective in a different way
if we can see the image further away and
we can turn down that volume it&#39;s going
to be less anxiety-ridden right and it&#39;s
going to allow us to be able to see
things from a rational perspective and
now we can say wait a minute
anger is getting the best of this
conversation what are we going to do are
we going to stop right now and walk away
and talk about it later or how are we
going to handle this right the other
thing you can do is you can practice
practice practice practice on yourself
if you see that you have a bias if you
recognize it now that you know it&#39;s out
there and that you&#39;re gonna have it you
will see it believe me it&#39;ll come it&#39;ll
pop up when that happens do this
technique on your on your set on your
own over and over and over until it&#39;s so
ingrained you don&#39;t even have to think
about it anymore
and the next thing that you can do is
teach everybody so if everyone in this
room now has their superpower and you
tell one other person your roommates
your family members friends from home
you tell one more person and now we have
twice as many people who can have a
better perspective because they have the
tools to know how to do that right so
one person at a time you can each change
the world and make it a better place so
go forth and use your superpower thank
you very much
you
