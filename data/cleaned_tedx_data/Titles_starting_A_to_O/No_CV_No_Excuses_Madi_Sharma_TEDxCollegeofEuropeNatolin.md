90 seconds that&#39;s as long as it takes an
interviewer to decide whether or not
they&#39;re going to give you an opportunity
you&#39;ve already started to judge me she&#39;s
a woman she&#39;s an ethnic minority she&#39;s
old where&#39;s her added value correct I am
an ethnic minority my father was from
India but would you have known that my
grandfather was from bid gosht Poland
gin dobry
my CV is empty but that hasn&#39;t stopped
me achieve equates of Asian woman of
achievement and the UK&#39;s best boss today
I want to represent the millions no
billions of people around the world who
have not been given an opportunity
because they have been judged without
being known good afternoon my name is
Maddy Maddy stands for make a difference
ideas everything that I do has to make a
difference it&#39;s my name and it&#39;s my
brand I am the most successful person in
the world because my definition of
success is that I wouldn&#39;t change my
life with anybody else on this planet
how many people can say that I have one
goal in life to ensure that everybody
gets to set their own definition of
success and to achieve it whatever it is
I understand I have a privilege and a
responsibility as do you
and from this moment on I want you to
accept your responsibility I want you to
understand the consequences of your
judgments and your actions but out of
judgments bad actions our lack of
accountability and our lack of morality
have given us a world full of injustice
inequalities and insecurities so where
do these barriers start as children we
know that everything is possible but as
we grow we take the influence we take
the learning and the insight from those
around us you can&#39;t do this you can&#39;t do
that which label can I give you which
box do you fit in show me your CV that&#39;s
the point that&#39;s the point when we go
from person to a piece of paper
god bless the CV
god bless europass did you know it takes
five to seven seconds to review a CV 75%
of CDs are eliminated by a computer 38%
of people lie on their CVS at all levels
men lie twice as much as women 88% of
CVS are rejected because of the photo
76% of CVS are rejected because of an
unprofessional email address there is a
whole new industry that has been created
to make up references but don&#39;t worry
because the majority of companies don&#39;t
even check the references
your future now lies in the hands of a
computer and an HR director they will
decide what is possible not you is it
any wonder therefore that 80% of people
hate the job that they&#39;re in that
companies employ the wrong people that
we have a skills mismatch where we have
a huge number of vacancies job vacancies
for us we have thousands millions of
people who are unemployed of course you
understand I&#39;m not talking about doctors
dentists lawyers the accredited
professions I&#39;m talking about the
majority of jobs in the world why
I was lying on the floor after my
husband had severely beaten me I had to
get up and walk out I had to pick my two
children up and take them with me
I had nothing no qualifications no
skills no registered competences no
money no opportunities nothing
I started cooking in my little kitchen
at home slowly slowly I started to build
a great food business I also gained in
confidence after eight years I failed I
lost everything I picked myself up i
justed myself down and I started all
over again today I run the Maddy group
the magic group has a philosophy we
believe in learning by doing we don&#39;t
believe in theories we don&#39;t believe in
business plans we don&#39;t believe in
Seavey&#39;s and we don&#39;t believe in a blame
culture we believe in people people who
can help us achieve our goals and where
we can help them achieve their goals -
I&#39;m extremely proud to say I&#39;m an
entrepreneur an entrepreneur with a
capital e entrepreneurs are the backbone
of the economy entrepreneurs create the
jobs they give the skills they give the
training we create the innovation we
solve the world&#39;s problems we create
wealth for individuals for communities
and for societies and we support
regeneration
Andrew Carnegie was hungry and in
poverty when he started a job in a
cotton factory it wasn&#39;t long before he
built his own steel mill and became the
richest
person in the world Samuel Walton milked
cows and delivered newspapers before
starting the retail giant giant we now
know as Walmart Oprah Winfrey raped at
the age of nine and again at 13 pregnant
at 14 but she went on to be a TV
sensation and a billionaire s Larry
Ellison dropped out of university and
started computer giant Oracle how many
more stories do you need Ted is full of
them
it&#39;s not about the CV it&#39;s about the
person it&#39;s about the passion the
persistence the knowledge the eyes 67%
of people who failed their interviews
because they didn&#39;t make eye contact we
are the ones who make the judgments we
are the ones who make the choices we are
the ones who present ourselves to the
world the way we want the world to see
us we don&#39;t need a CV oh sorry
of course we do sorry of course we do
because we&#39;re not just our own judgment
we don&#39;t judge just the judgment of our
teams what happens if something goes
wrong who&#39;s going to take the
responsibility
so the CV is a replacement for the blame
culture shame on us shame on us we are
losing the best talents because we are
obsessed with qualifications the 21st
century is the era of Ko Ko working
collaboration cooperation communication
and collateral collateral is our human
talent our collateral
today is our young people and what are
we doing with our young people we&#39;re
manipulating them you have to have a CV
or you won&#39;t get a job you have to have
a degree or you won&#39;t get a job you have
to have experience or you won&#39;t get a
job what a load of rubbish employers
want people to come with bright fresh
minds we want the young people to tell
us the oldies how things are done
nowadays I want people to come and join
my company who can tell me how they can
help my company and my clients and I&#39;m
sorry young people if you can&#39;t pitch
and you can&#39;t sell yourself then you
don&#39;t deserve the job if you don&#39;t knock
on doors and ask to be given the
opportunities tell the companies how you
can help them solve their problems then
you&#39;re not going to get the jobs you&#39;re
gonna get the no response you have to
believe in yourself or nobody else is
going to believe in you there&#39;s
absolutely no proof that having a CV
brings the best person for the job
you don&#39;t use a CV to choose your life
partner superheroes don&#39;t have Seavey&#39;s
politicians don&#39;t need a CV to be
elected the financial crisis was caused
by highly qualified mba executives who
made a mess and are still in those jobs
criminal minds the mafia they&#39;re highly
entrepreneurial highly innovative people
whose society didn&#39;t give a chance to so
in order
they created the lives that they have
today and who are we ignoring today who
are we excluding today our young people
so what&#39;s the solution you have to have
a solution the solution is we have to
create a society based on values you
have to pick up your responsibility and
obligation to implement those values and
the value most important is people and
human capital if you are an HR director
or a CEO of a company ask yourselves why
why are you really using a CV for
recruitment and then ask yourself what
what is your organization losing as the
result of this discriminatory process if
you sit on a decision-making board at
any level ask yourself where where are
the 30% young people young people are
not our future young people are there
now their voice has deserved to be heard
now around the table now and ask
yourself where where are the 50 percent
women diversity is an asset it is not a
liability the days of the white stay or
male are over it&#39;s time for change our
theories our teaching our careers
guidance Seavey&#39;s they&#39;re antiquated the
world has moved on you now need just one
piece of paper and it&#39;s a blank piece of
paper and on the top of it you need to
write
what it is that you really want to do
what is your definition of success what
is your life&#39;s destination every morning
and every night
read it out guarantee you it will come
true because you will be focused and
when you are focused you will see the
opportunities you will overcome the
challenges with a smile and you will
network within those places environments
where people will help you achieve your
goals nothing is impossible when you
know what it is that you want success is
within reach but you have to go get it
it&#39;s not going to be given to you
Ghandi said you must be the change you
want to see you Maddie says you must be
the change you want to see no excuses no
Seavey&#39;s no judgments thank you
