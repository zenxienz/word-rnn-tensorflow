welcome everybody I come from the land
of temples so it&#39;s over nakum can I hear
I wanna come from everybody
such real call I was going to do that
because you have invited me here so
thank you so very much
I&#39;m truly honored rather ecstatic to be
standing before an August gathering
prospective principal secretary thank
you so very much for having me here and
micro speakers and my dear children
thank you very much well
this is a little Indira Gandhi who went
to school are the first day and when the
principal asked me I was five years old
father was kicked out of the school a
million times for not getting into the
school saying that the schools had no
place for me because it was completely
full no admissions at all
my father didn&#39;t give up he said no if
my daughter went to this school she
would only go to this school at
Hyderabad
and persistently about 20 days of
waiting one final day the principal
calls him in and says okay we will have
an interview for your daughter and if
she succeeds we will give her the
admission otherwise I&#39;m sorry she was a
beautiful nun a 6 feet tall she just
picked me up in her arms took me into
the room and said the first question
boys what is your name I should have
said my name is Srimati but I don&#39;t know
I said my name was Indira Gandhi and
everybody laughed at me
visit your improv ally I don&#39;t know what
happened but then I got into the school
I&#39;d probably with the same qualities of
being a leader was the school leader
went on to play 10 Nationals basketball
Nationals represented the state of
Andhra Pradesh was a senior under
officer NCC the first ever gold cadet to
hold a sword and salute was a
paratrooper
was a silver medalist in All India rifle
shooting what of command and you name it
I was there well this applause this
applause is what it gives you that
little bit of kick every time you do
something extraordinary right all of us
get so attached to this
and the same way on 22nd November 1992 I
was static being the first woman to
carry the Swart and keep a parade
a salute to the Jan to the general kV
Krishna after the 10 general kV Krishna
Rao who was so surprised to see a girl
cadet
with such smartness in such fullness and
he immediately called for my father and
said we want this girl to be in the army
and mind you that was without writing
the SSC or SEC so that&#39;s the honor there
because all of us know how difficult it
is to get into the army when you write
all these exams so that was the most
proudest moment in my life well my
father came he met he shook hands with
general aviation around and pops up my
wedding invitation so general and all
the Colonel&#39;s were but they didn&#39;t know
what to express they were like are you
very serious we are talking about taking
your daughter into the army and you are
getting her married no choice so the
invitation was handed and my journey
from sward nuts on my friend
it is a sward so from sort directly into
spatula I was 18 years old when I went
into this beautiful relationship called
wedding and you know how it is for an
Indian woman to get into this with all
dreams
thinking that it was better frozen and
you had a Prince Charming coming in a
horse and got to pick you up little did
you know that you had so many things to
give up in life
no you just thought you would get decked
up only the wedding wedding wedding
Mandy and everything came into your face
you didn&#39;t think about the rest of the
story but when the actual hits you it&#39;s
totally different
at 20 I became a mother for a beautiful
daughter she was just like a Barbie doll
for me because I didn&#39;t know what I
should be doing to her she cries and I
cry and I just tell her please don&#39;t
crying please don&#39;t cry both of us will
eat chocolate because that&#39;s what I knew
but then that&#39;s a challenge again Indian
woman I guess even if you&#39;re a child
you&#39;re really brought up in such a way
that we do multitasking and similarly
this multitasking helped me so much to
bring her up but as she grew I think
mentally I started growing and typical
South Indian family it is like if the
husband is really doing well or I should
say Indian family and more so
predominantly the South Indian family if
the husband is really doing well the
wife will do the household chores
you may be the best carriage of Andhra
Pradesh you may be the best unit of
India you might have played 18 Nationals
you may be the state athlete you may be
the best dancer elocution name it but
you will only be doing pastas and those
arse and mind your children the passes
and those ours are not going to be
awarded because it all depends on the
mood of the family if you did the best
and expected something from them it was
like oh did I have pasta today and I&#39;m
like no that is a dosa because there&#39;s
so preoccupied
ten years went by I didn&#39;t use my pencil
or pen I used to really earn to write I
used them only to sign checks I was
wondering if I was gonna be alive for
about 60 years this is what am I gonna
do all my life
slowly I started thinking and thinking
why woman we&#39;re getting depressed when
they were getting into mid thirties and
fourties because our times predominantly
women we&#39;re at home so you just had not
many people to think of as inspiration
inspiration always comes from within
that&#39;s what I believe because being a
sportsman I always thought when I fall
down I have to get back I have to spring
back and nobody is gonna come and pull
you off so similarly I thought I have to
pull back and for every person every
individual I think there is somebody
that somebody called a friend a friend
comes to you either to teach how to give
you an experience a lesson I had both
being a best carrot of utter Pradesh I
had a co best cabbage from Maharashtra
whom I met after 15 years of her marital
life I met her at a conference here I
was so happy seeing her because she has
grown as an editor editor of a top notch
magazine in the country I was so proud
of her I thought my car professionally
she is so good and she was in her best
of clothes wearing evening gown and
collecting her award that evening I was
all praise for her she came to teach me
she was premisis Audia whom I always
remember and over lot to her she asked
me what I was doing and when I told her
I was a proud mother I was a good
housewife and I was doing everything
that the Indian woman had to be doing
she said oh really what are you doing to
yourself
are you happy doing all this I said I&#39;m
the best you know my husband treats me
like a queen I have a big house I have
somebody I have everything possible that
a woman needs
she said what about your inner self
there came apart there came apart and
she was the person who put me because
she knew that I was a science fanatic
and she said there is a conference
happening in Miami I would nominate to
you from South India why don&#39;t you do
that
with great difficulties all the
permissions and everything from home
from parents from husbands from in-laws
flew to Miami and that&#39;s where the
journey began from sward to spatula and
now to space there I had met the
administrators of NASA they&#39;ve been
given beautiful presentations there so I
went to them I spoke to them and found
out if children could be coming there
and for hands-on activities and
everything they said yes of course
although where children come here I
asked him our children from India coming
over they told me no not really
and much part of India do you belong to
I said Chennai oh no we knew Italian
Mumbai Amitabh Bachchan Shah Rukh Khan I
said we don&#39;t belong to all that we
belong to Rajinikanth MGR and sera tea
so they said oh who are they I said
don&#39;t worry they&#39;re not aliens and then
there starts the journey I was given the
Ambassador status for Ignacio space
camps and today I&#39;m the proud ambassador
for the Russian Space Center so the
journey kept moving and moving
that was not all when you start thinking
about space space is so huge do you want
to do something but you don&#39;t know what
to do because you&#39;re not a space
scientist neither are you an engineer to
do anything but you had creative ideas
so to put forward all these ideas to
pack up everything you need brains you
need children
and I said okay let me start an
organisation which can do everything so
that&#39;s where space gets idea was born
and space gets India is to create
platform for children which keeps pace
that is the inner self the cleansing of
inner self the space that is untrue
Akshay everybody knows about it and
space is the platform brain I was able
to take children to the Olympics to
perform the first-ever time from the
country about hundred children to
perform at the Indian Olympics London
and then about thousand five hundred
children to NASA so this was on and on
but there is something that says this is
not all
when you look around
children keep talking only about
becoming engineers and doctors
what about scientists for India dr.
Narayana Murthy a couple of years ago
mentioned that we still don&#39;t have a
brilliant idea for the last 60 years but
I refuse to accept that
I totally refuse because we have the
brains Indian children have got the best
of the brains you didn&#39;t be an IIT in
you need not go to the best of the
universities but still even a student
from the smallest town is got brains
it&#39;s just the platform that is required
so I said to myself to create scientists
for India let&#39;s embark on this journey
called young scientist India so last
four years we&#39;ve been working on that
and that culminated into picking the
best six students best six students who
went on to create the world&#39;s lightest
smallest and the first ever 3d printed
satellite the Kalam Sat we launched that
from NASA Wallops 22nd of June this year
I had created history everybody said
everybody said higher kids
icn&#39;s or mit uns I said no I&#39;ve got kids
from the village fall color party you
wouldn&#39;t you have to figure out in
Google where it is
and Nana Purim again you have to figure
out from Google where these places are
and these kids are from such town small
towns but when given a platform NASA was
baffled to see the idea they said oh my
god
Indians can do so much at this age and
that&#39;s history that&#39;s history so I would
say the journey continues
this is not all we are here to put a lot
of satellites and make a lot of rockets
because aerospace is one thing that I
feel is kind of treated orphaned in our
country not many students are given the
right kind of an opportunity so we
wanted to create air Oprah naver&#39;s for
the country because space is the future
and we could do space mining space
farming you name it everything from
space
it is not only that we need to go into a
governmental organization to work but I
was a private organization with student
community we want to prove to the world
that our youngsters can do anything and
create a name for India thank you so
very much for this opportunity given I&#39;m
overwhelmed and I would like to show a
small video of what space kids has been
doing thank you again
