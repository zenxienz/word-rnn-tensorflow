good afternoon to all
the great philosopher Heidegger once
said take a leap into the darkness
I think today&#39;s theme in directly
relates to me the same way I took it
very seriously I suppose on 4th August
1986 I went into coma in Ruby Hall and
my friend said doctor said there is no
hope and my close friends told me later
on that they prayed for my peaceful
death because there may not be a much
use of me in the future becoming a
burden to the society
I never appear on any stages today
somehow to some means I happen to be
here it is said in Bible God created the
world in six days and he found it was
very good but today when we look around
are we able to see that good in the
world
or the humanity is decreasing in 1993 I
was on my way to Pune and went to Satara
best and I saw him an early morning
sitting and eating some upma that was
damn near a trash bin he was sitting
little far because a donkey and a street
door also was eating from the same dish
that said still it reflects in my mind I
don&#39;t know perhaps God had a plan to put
me into this work soon I happen to see a
home for the mentally challenged Street
children run by the government of
Maharashtra it cannot be called a home
there was not even a single toilet
working toilet no running water and
almost all children are totally naked I
remember some children were waiting for
the escrito of other children to fill
their stomach I seen no human being
should go through or live through
I had a plan to do something but as we
say nothing is certain
sooner or later the person in charge
came to us asking whether you can do
something I said yes we will do but how
we were a little disturbed
we took all these children to our office
building I still I remember one boy out
of joy he was telling there is plenty of
water we&#39;ll bring all the people here
because first time they are seeing water
like that we give them food gave them
baths and with new dress we made them
sleep unfortunately in an hour time they
were all in shit they were not prepared
for such a situation but I can tell you
we we&#39;re ready to take up the risk all
the children were running away from the
home that was their tendency somehow if
you leave immediately they run away but
I can tell you when you start a project
when you start to work with these
children or anything like this first you
are scared we don&#39;t know how to go about
but if you jump in definitely you find
the means I will say embrace the
uncertain try to imagine dream great
things our great scientists late Abdul
Kalam used to say dream their friends I
always dream great things and partially
I share it my with my companions if you
say everything they will call you mad
you are mad and I listen to them get
their feedbacks their suggestions and
this will help us to go about this is
how I used to manage but I don&#39;t say
breathing is easy and I bought this
children I still remember one day I went
to a show up and back
than word six pairs of shorts but in an
hour time I could see the elastic of it
on the forehead of a boy he might have
imagined such an Tendulkar or her hero
but that&#39;s the type of work we do soon I
must say in 2000 when we took over this
home from the government of Maharashtra
in the admonition admission register
there were one hundred and fifty three
boys but we got only 42 I mean in 14
years
111 disappeared from the hall either
died or ran away the situation was that
till today in 17 years we lost only 11
children why we know every human being
requires food shelter clothing we give
them we give them good food medical care
and training I never keep them idle they
are always busy they have not time
morning once they get up how to go for
yoga they have breakfast then they have
to go for work personal work and they
come for the activities evening 4

o&#39;clock so men till 6:00 they have not
time so they are busy and as Sudarsan
was telling when you come inside you can
come anytime they are free that keeps
them children were running away I used
to sit the bike and use look at how they
are running they look whether are you
coming back
no nobody is after him then they will
stop after 5 minutes again they will run
little more and look by somebody&#39;s
coming no nobody&#39;s coming so slowly they
come back that&#39;s how I brought them
now we can keep it open they won&#39;t run
away but still their friends asked the
days past we found it was not easy to
keep them like that we wrote to the
government please transfer the elderly
ones they are becoming fit physically
fit and they are big they may be harmed
the younger ones they are remember they
are all Street children many are hyper
many are psychic
these are the children who are living
with us and they change so anything can
happen anytime but the government said
we have no place who will accept them
father you do something for them we were
in a dilemma then we went ahead and we
started a chakra the new habilitation
standard it is a place where they can
relax they can work they get a breathing
some people from Pune came to me and
told me father this circus or that&#39;s
what was a bad dream I kept in my mind
to build a sword for the children when I
heard it from somebody else some
visitors I felt happy a dream getting
fulfilled to some extent dear friends I
don&#39;t say everything is smooth there are
times when we face difficulties problems
it&#39;s part of life if it is not there
then then there is no life it is said in
the Bible God will not permit you to be
tempted to a degree that you cannot all
commit if you are consistent successes
you ways
I remember an incident happened to me we
had a boy called Lilith it was a very
hyper boy but very sweet boy he was a
sadist used to attack anyone and used to
enjoy doctors suggested please transfer
him to your harem in the hospital
finally we had no choice we transferred
him he was there in the hospital for a
few months later on he came back but he
was diagnosis TB tuberculosis we started
a course for six months no result
second course for nine months no result
because he was so hyper he used to get
the medicine and threw away he never
used to take proper food no way ready
for that finally he was diagnosed as her
suffering from incurable TB MDR the
state&#39;s doctors told me to separate him
where we asked the government where to
separate where to send nowhere in
Maharashtra in 90 tar there is a center
I was told what can we do he put him
along with other children because there
was no other way things took a
surprising turn and a fine morning he
came to me and told can he give me a
room there there is a room shall I go
and stay there under the water trying
there was a room I had asked him earlier
can you stay there no no no I won&#39;t say
now he&#39;s coming and asking me can I stay
there he became like an angel so sweet
so obedient always bearing the mosque
he was having side effects loose motion
were meeting everything earlier when the
key was taking the medicine
this time medicine was very strong
everyday injection but very punctual for
the medicine no side effects doctors are
asking no scientific how can it happen
but boy was so good he played Diwali
cracking birthdays everything the night
along with other children they went to
sleep and still he was cracking crackers
but on the following day he drowned in a
pond he went after the duck it was a
shock none of us could bear it be I
couldn&#39;t tolerate it
at a few days I was waiting in the
railway station to pick up a friend my
friend of one of one friend of mine he
was coming in the midnight one o&#39;clock
train
so I told Lilith you have given me such
a shock but please tell me if you have
ten mukti and if you are in peace give
me a sign I want it I want a friend of
mine who was not not talking to me for
the last one year he calls me at now
itself dear friends I just told him like
that then I got the call at toll Oh

Clawd 12:30 he was asking Thomas what
happened what happened I couldn&#39;t answer
I was with joy
dear friends these are the Specht soft
joy when we are working with this type
of children there are hardships
difficulties problems but when we work
we experience this joy often my friends
asked me Thomas are you not tired
working with them for so many years I
say no every day is a booster so many
dreams I don&#39;t even tell my friends
still more and more dreams as Abdul
Kalam said I believe is our dream
there&#39;s a chance to get it fulfilled
from unexpected corner people will come
and support you that&#39;s how I go ahead I
keep my dream and when I start working
with that tinging on that someone is
coming and asking ok I&#39;m telling like
this see I am staying in a remote
village not even having a telephone
connection no internet even the
connectivity is very poor but people
once in a while come and say I&#39;ll do
something then middle a German start I
am sure I am going to fulfill it
I know targets I had to finish it
tomorrow they have tomorrow but when I
look back I can see wood was so kind you
were so kind to me at our children
embrace the uncertainty you will enjoy
it you will relax it you will be
successful
thank
[Applause]
