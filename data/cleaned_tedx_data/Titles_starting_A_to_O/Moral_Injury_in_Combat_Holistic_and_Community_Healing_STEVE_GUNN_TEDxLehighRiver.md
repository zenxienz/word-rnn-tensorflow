I am very happy to be here today to talk
with you about a very serious subject I
invite you to go on a journey with me
we&#39;ll be going to Vietnam we&#39;ll be going
to some places deep in the heart some
dark places some academic places some
intriguing places and then to
possibility and hope so
come along last December I was in
Vietnam with a group of fellow veterans
on a journey of healing and
reconciliation there I learned about a
very important concept moral injury I
learned about one pathway to healing
this injury and I discovered that I had
incurred a moral injury during my
service in the Vietnam War I&#39;m sharing
this with you today for two reasons to
help expand our understanding of the
challenges that many veterans experience
as they return home from war and to help
fellow veterans who may be experiencing
moral injury to see it to understand it
and to find some of the peace and the
healing that I&#39;m finding as I tend this
wound
when I was with my fellow veterans in
Vietnam we were walking in the district
of coochie when we encountered madam kee
she was sweeping her courtyard she
welcomed us into her home we sat at her
dining room table and in front of her
family altar and she shared some of her
story with us her brother had been
killed in a napalm attack during the war
I said I feel bad about what we did in
your country no madam kee said don&#39;t
feel that way you were just doing what
you were told to do I had a surprisingly
intense emotional response to Madame
Kees forgiveness
tears of joy and grief and relief welled
up frequently during the rest of the
journey and at times I tears still well
up when when I speak of Madame Kees
forgiveness those tears were my clue
that I had incurred a moral injury but I
didn&#39;t realize that at that time and my
emotions didn&#39;t make sense to me let me
tell you why I was in Social Work school
in 1969 when I received my draft notice
I believed that the war was morally
wrong and I applied for conscientious
objector status because I did not want
blood on my hands for killing in a war
that I felt was morally wrong I served
as a combat medic with a hundred and
first Airborne Division in the last
major battle of the Vietnam War after I
left a combat role I provided medical
care in the local villages so here&#39;s
what puzzled me
I carried no weapon I killed no one I
helped my fellow soldiers and I helped
the local villages so what was the
source of my moral injury and guilt as I
have discovered I was morally injured
when I was compelled to witness and to
support killing in a war that I felt was
morally wrong and what was the source of
my intense emotional response to Madame
Kees forgiveness when madam key said
don&#39;t feel that way you were just doing
what you were told to do she was
directly acknowledging my moral injury
and guilt and she was doing so with care
and kindness Madame key was
demonstrating the Vietnamese community
approach to addressing veteran trauma
Bret lits is a psychologist with the
United States Department of Veterans
Affairs the VA brett describes the
causes of moral injury this way it&#39;s
perpetrating failing to prevent bearing
witness to or learning about acts that
transgress deeply held moral beliefs and
expectations dr. Jonathan Shea also
indicates that moral injury can result
from betrayal of what&#39;s right by someone
who holds legitimate authority in a
high-stakes situation but one soldier
described the source of his moral injury
very simply it&#39;s when the head says to
do what the heart says is wrong David
Wood is author of what we have done the
moral injury of our longest Wars David
describes a story of moral injury in
Afghanistan a young marine was in a
bad firefight there were casualties on
both sides Marines and Taliban out of
the corner of his eye he saw a figure
spraying bullets from an assault rifle
when he got the figure in his sights he
saw that it was a boy 12 or 13 he took
aim and fired according to military
rules of engagement it was a justifiable
kill he was accomplishing his mission he
was protecting his fellow Marines and he
was protecting himself but when the
young marine returned home to civilian
life he found that he had a bruise on
his soul
a painful violation of the civilian
rules of right and wrong since 1980
post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD has
been the major tool that we have used to
understand the impact of battle trauma
on veterans the specific term moral
injury first appeared in a research
article in 2009 and it appeared there
because there are problems that PTSD
cannot address it can&#39;t explain these
these problems doctor Jonathan Shay is a
psychiatrist who devoted his career to
serving veterans in the VA who were
diagnosed with PTSD dr. Jonathan Shea
describes powerfully and simply why it
is so crucial for us to look at moral
injury and I&#39;ll get to that later but
right now I&#39;m going to talk to you about
the experience of moral injury the VA
describes the experience of moral injury
this way
highly aversive and haunting states of
inner conflict and
turmoil shame guilt anxiety anger
alienation withdrawal and self
condemnation alcohol or drug use
emotional numbing underemployment or
unemployment failed or harmed
relationships and self harming including
suicide research shows that there&#39;s a
direct link between moral injury and
suicide because guilt is a major trigger
for suicide so this is quite a list and
I think you can see by looking at this
list why it is so crucial for us to give
moral injury close scrutiny so as I said
in since 1980 PTSD has been the major
tool that we&#39;ve utilized and moral
injury appeared in 2009 because it&#39;s fit
filled in the gaps where there were
problems that PTSD cannot explain
so dr. Jonathan Shea describes very
simply why it&#39;s so crucial for us to
look at moral injury PTSD is rarely what
wrecks veterans lives or crushes them to
suicide moral injury does both
I discovered some intriguing information
while I was in Vietnam and I want to
share this with you because I think it
can help us as we seek to help our
veterans with moral injury the
vietnamese experienced staggering levels
of death destruction and privation
during what they call the american war
for example three million Vietnamese
died versus 58,000 Americans but despite
this great disparity in levels of trauma
dr. Levin how of the Institute of
psychology in Hanoi states that the
chronic and comprehensive breakdown
often seen among American veterans is
absent among Vietnamese veterans dr. Lee
describes protective factors in Vietnam
that affect the way the Vietnamese
responded to the war let&#39;s take a look
at one of these protective factors
Vietnamese communities have a different
relationship with their veterans than we
do here in the u.s. in the u.s. veterans
often feel that they must bear the
burden of their invisible wounds on
their own and they feel reluctant to
share their stories in a civilian
community dr. edy tick is author of
warriors warriors return restoring the
soul after war dr. tick describes the
relationship of Vietnamese communities
to their veterans in Vietnam communities
have been traditionally witnessing their
warriors stories and they&#39;ve been doing
it in homes and pagodas and community
centers they&#39;ve been doing this on a
spontaneous basis for hundreds of years
Vietnamese communities feel that the
stories soldiers the stories
soldier&#39;s stories feel that they feel
that they
are belong to the community as a whole
and that they share they have the
responsibility to carry these stories in
their hearts Vietnamese communities feel
a shared responsibility for the decision
to go to war so how can we apply this in
the u.s. first morale injuries not a
medical diagnosis this is a wound that&#39;s
in the moral spiritual and social arenas
therefore Medical Care might be helpful
at times but in order to truly address
this wound holistic care is required
doctor EdTech describes the components
of holistic care
it addresses mind body heart and spirit
in community guided with transcendent
meaning there are places in the VA where
such holistic care is being provided in
addition to the work of these skilled
professionals the involvement of the
community is required in order to
complete holistic care let me let me
describe one approach to involving our
communities with our veterans there are
community listening circles where
veterans and civilians can gather in a
small group where veterans can share
their stories as a part of their healing
there&#39;s several requirements for such a
circle first a group of veterans who are
willing to share their stories in a
civilian circle and a group of civilians
who are trained and committed to this
work who are willing to listen to
difficult stories with open
compassionate and with strong hearts
they need to be willing to own their
part of the responsibility for sending
the soldiers to war and in order to true
we honor these life and death stories a
sacred space is required it&#39;s a sacred
space not a religious space so what are
the consequences if we do not take
action to expand our understanding of
moral injury and how to attend this
wound recent research shows that 25% of
veterans who are at risk for moral
injury upon returning home from war so
if we take that 25% and we look at
veterans who served in Vietnam Iraq
Afghanistan I calculate that at least
1.2 million veterans are at risk for
moral injury if we do not take action to
expand our understanding of the injury
and and how to address it 1.2 million
veterans may not receive the help that
they need to deal with this crushing and
life-threatening wound so how can we as
a community gather together to address
this problem I have some recommendations
we can support public dialogue like
we&#39;re doing today to heighten awareness
of moral injury support research to
increase our understanding of this
injury and support community-based and
holistic programs for our veterans more
specifically you can find one of these
community listening circles and
participate if there&#39;s not one in your
area I suggest that you seek out
guidance and support if you&#39;re
interested in creating such a circle I
invite our communities to follow the
example of madam key to acknowledge
moral injury in community and to do so
with care
and with kindness and finally have you
ever felt awkward or uncomfortable in
the presence of a veteran I have some of
us veterans can have a pretty rough
exterior if you find yourself feeling
awkward or uncomfortable in the presence
of a veteran consider this the person in
front of you may be experiencing moral
injury and that fact guarantees that
you&#39;re standing in the presence of a
kind compassionate heart thank you
