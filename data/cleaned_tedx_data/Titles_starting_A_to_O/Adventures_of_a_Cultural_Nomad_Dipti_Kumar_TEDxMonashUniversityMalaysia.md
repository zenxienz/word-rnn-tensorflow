in early 2015 Jack Ma the founder of
Alibaba said that more than 34 percent
of their senior management are women and
is the secret sauce of the company that
year
Alibaba recorded a five point five
billion US dollar profit while Amazon
reporter 241 million dollar loss Alibaba
has always been regarded as an industry
leader and has proven itself by being
kind of a filter over the years Jack Ma
Ocwen attributes its success to
embracing diversity of all kinds
including gender this visionary was able
to see the true value in embracing
diversity to provide all of this big and
efficient solutions diversity is defined
as the condition or instance of being
composed of different elements so what
is it about the diversity right we get
it
that&#39;s a diversity of everything gender
sexuality personalities food you know
big Malaysians color we hear the word
diversity all the time and if that most
of us formulations come from a very
diverse land and exposed to it so Jana
why are we not excellent at it yet the
key words here are embracing diversity
to embrace these to do more than merely
accept something to accept it is just to
do things you know walk around it to
embrace it is to live with it to work
with it and to be part of it but people
ask why why should i erase diversity why
can I just stick with my Punjabi friends
my female colleagues my entire sexual
classmates logical question why should I
put in extra effort to go and do things
I normally don&#39;t do with people I don&#39;t
only hang out
Immanuel Kant an 18th century German
philosopher once said that enlightenment
is man&#39;s emergence from his
could immaturity cut in trying to
understand what success means to him and
the human race theorized on what purpose
we are capable of achieving and super
beings in his walk Kant devises an
unrealized future state of the human
world not defined by federalism state is
seeking individualism with a sense of
moral and cultural maturity this ideal
society is not something he created
based on one who has seen the world or
some ideal dreams that we had but this
future society was depicted by him based
on a casual and rigid study of sociology
human behavior and the history of the
human development for the time of course
no more sitting in a pod careful study
we don&#39;t see that Kant&#39;s theory had a
major factor guess what diversity this
theory had human beings who embraced and
lived within diversity seeing it as
valuable and important in helping each
other develop and grow despite some -
downsides and challenges along the way
this seems a successful model with all
sectors of the economy and society
benefiting this is what we&#39;re talking
about today everywhere achieving a
united wholesome society that embraces
diversity the diversity that keeps
growing and being able to do away with
our individual reserves and arbitrary
borders that we call countries we talk
about world peace all the time we here
will peace all time inequality poverty
slowly but surely
yes we&#39;re getting there but we&#39;re not
there yet and we&#39;re far from it only
with us you and I human beings as
individuals see the true value diversity
and the immaturity in our defensive
stance towards fellow humans who are
just different we will progress a lot
further not me in terms of my
but I mean a lot further right
holistically economically mentally our
mental and physical health and the
general happiness of human beings if
human beings are built to be able to
reach this state in our social
development why not in this busy day in
age of mobile phones
well success startup war and
interconnectedness human beings are so
consumed with the world that we created
ourselves right we are not superficially
the world not about gadgets technologies
water dams Wi-Fi networks
none of it mean a thing it only means
something to human beings am I the train
from a young age to be consumed by our
personal lives we always had something
to do finish something it you need an
assignment but we&#39;re not given the space
and the time to think about what defines
us as individuals and what defines us as
people right this is the self-incurred
immaturity that Kant was talking about
and he said the key to making this
change is reason true success is in
living a full and complete life being
transformed weathers and transforming
others lives as children or the 21st
century when diversity is becoming more
and more corporate catchphrase you share
it all the time everywhere embracing
diversity as a species is imminent and
necessary and it will come it has to
happen whether through bloodshed of
peaceful conciliation and now is the
time for you to embrace diversity and
those who don&#39;t do it first will not
reap rewards as much as possible first
they will reap the rewards
multiple now allow me to share with you
my little story of being the token
diversity person the adventures of a
cultural go man I have a cute family of
three kids the middle child born and
bred in Bangkok Oliver for I had a fun
childhood for most of it I come from a
single
and I have always enjoyed the
completeness of my as the up child I had
the privilege to attend many classes
belly to piano classes and get white
eggs together person fighting classes
swimming drama and reading goes on and
actually I see well it&#39;s not part
financial challenges what a common issue
as we had what only one so great winner
I started learning at the age of 13
giving tuition to the neighborhood kids
I never took an allowance with my mom
funny part of my own meals my own
expenditure and I never felt a lack
something the one thing though that my
mother always ensured was that my
education never suffered she would save
in many other ways but she would always
ensure our access to books stationery
the internet safe wormed good food it&#39;s
always available I went to school I
would speak normally I was invested in I
would never complete my homework
how do percent of the time guys and for
most of my secondary school I was out of
class in the stairways you know what&#39;s
cool whooping whooping class yeah
studies wise I did pretty well suppose
today I never wanted to stand up the
thing is about my life I didn&#39;t stand up
I&#39;m kajaani the people could understand
why I never had a core behind my name
and I feel them in Punjabi Hindu you see
they like you
what&#39;s up with your skin color I&#39;m like
me okay
I&#39;ve always been it&#39;s my personality
many teachers could not stand my style
and hated the way I ask questions all
the time at the age of 14 I was told
that I would have to find a way to find
my own education or risk not studying
financial challenges I had heard of a
girl from my community to receive the
JPA scholarship
abroad and from that moment everything I
did intuitions in school was get up
towards this I always used to miss
classes always but I used to make up for
it
studied on my own I need my own style I
walked smiled but not that time I
initiate the projects at school I got
involved in societies for my CV I
received the JPA scholarship many as
make the income star by immigrants I
attended a youth camp where I was told
that I&#39;m a conductor
I don&#39;t deserve to be here and I
shouldn&#39;t be here as a student who
always miss classes in school and
college the teachers and lecturers grew
to be here in doubt me
just before sitting my final physics a
level exam my lecturer told me to pray
really hard to bring my failure to a
pass I was like well thank you for the
support of my own I did not need because
I was so confused with in all these
different labels of every scheme right
the challenges of unwittingly haven&#39;t
faced adversity made it hard to find
sense of belonging in an identity to go
with it you know
over the years I learned I went abroad
King&#39;s College London completed my hobby
I was exposed to a very cosmopolitan
city that spoke 300 languages dating I
had to figure my way around work
part-time in a foreign country where
English was spoken the normal way and my
English was weird
someone asked me Malaysia was where we
still live with trees and I&#39;m like yeah
that&#39;s why we&#39;re healthy the new guys
I had a tough time explaining how a
Malaysian despite looking Indian and
having ethnic roots I get stopped at
every single Airport I go through every
single Airport July 13 London Nepal
everywhere like what are you were you
from like well I&#39;m just me during law
school I could never focus for more than
10 minutes so I miss not are many things
that lecturers have discussed here my
friends around we got everything so fast
I&#39;m sure a lot of you here I had to work
nicely about to get even close to what
was necessary and I suffered crippling
depression in my first year of
university without even knowing it my
friend should not come I go up to get me
out for dinner and I would not answer I
was always so out of place and I need to
be in my own skin why did I stand up why
did I not feel a sense of belonging to
any community but it&#39;s not that my
master at King&#39;s again I decided with
some prodding from my best friend to pay
a visit to the disability service and I
did and much to my dismay at that time I
was diagnosed with ADHD wait and so I
had ADHD for 24 years and I didn&#39;t know
it he was going on here well that was
the cause of my lack of attendance in
classes you know then ability to write
fast invite long messages my hatred to
my daughter greed and my struggles
throughout University trying to pay
attention and be be present so this
diagnosis meant that I could see I could
not read long passages viral messages of
focus for more than 10 minutes how I got
again I feel like I&#39;ve always had to
work extra hard to achieve what others
could in half the effort I felt like a
whipping to the world right
I had another label now to my diversity
portfolio through it all there&#39;ll be a
random passerby on my journey would
appear and just show me meant an
unconditional support and faith in my
potential of me just some random person
who does
know who she is I found a mentor and a
random on TV who will help me find many
answers to big spiritual questions like
what is life why do we just no meeting
tonight I had a cousin brother give me
career advice I had a best friend who&#39;s
right here today who helped me learn how
to love myself a lecturer at the
University who stopped eventually he
recommended me for a job way beyond my
years
the feeling of empowerment and
confidence this gave me was newfound in
a career these people educated me they
changed my life these are the
individuals who helped me stay strong
and what I believed in having no sense
of belonging made it difficult to deal
with all the bits of microaggressions of
being the token diversity person I owned
it and lived through it I fought for it
and I keep fighting every day but not
with others with myself when I was
informed that I would not have any
financial support was SPM
I thought I applied for scholarships and
college competitions that offered
scholarships and what my first
scholarship at the age of 15 the dream
is pure results came out I was not
outside of reading with my friends but I
was at home in front of the desktop that
was really slow using the TM that three
weeks connection applying for all 150
scholarships that were available I just
needed one come on in a box physics exam
never actually said I would fail I
received 100% score experiencing
depression in my first day in university
I dealt with it by taking small steps
each day just a post piece for today
even when I could not believe in that
thought for the death of me I signed up
for therapy and many years later I&#39;m
proud to tell you that I don&#39;t know the
combination law student in the UK for a
year
two years later when I was diagnosed
with ADHD took me a while to come to
terms with this new label you know and
it personally so it frustrated me so
much after all diversity exists because
of the labels and categorizations that
we give each other we human beings have
created these systems and these
categorizations aware from who you are
where you belong to me after some
current research on ADHD in a corner
that Michael Phelps American swimmer was
diagnosed with severe ADHD as a child
and what his parents do they put in for
swimming and he became the best swimmer
in the US during his time I mean he
could do it
look what he made out of it I had to
conceive I&#39;m sure I could do it some
renewed hope somebody and I played for a
fund to purchase the software they
converted textbooks and weakened text to
an audio voice format it costs some
money about 700 pounds but how was I
going to read 10,000 pages of legal
journals
a week having ADHD when I knew I
struggled the past four years
well I&#39;m so glad as it turned out I got
the fund I got the software me really
well and three I&#39;m so proud to share
with you that I was topping my course
full of international finance he must
guys I still don&#39;t know how I did it
buddy it somehow
yeah just to let you know attendance was
only 10% in university so got your back
hey could you I got your back nice there
are service jacks out there who those
who embrace diversity encourage each
other to flourish
these are those riding the wave of 21st
century and doing it with heart feel
compelled by those who helped me
throughout my journey my biggest passion
it&#39;s an empowering others access to
education because that&#39;s what I got and
that&#39;s why I&#39;m here today when I was 16
I started tutoring at a local orphanage
for young children academic challenges
and before I left to pursue my degree
abroad I posted a status on Facebook
asking if anyone could mentor them and
some continuity in that method she would
have been good I got 150 responses this
was my chance I said over rocha because
I everyone&#39;s availabilities match time
to children in the home and suddenly a
teetering project was born this project
continued a few years and Wallace in
London
I met her local children with character
development change challenges in my free
time I still needed something more of
life I decided to save up and hid in a
pal per month you know chill out it&#39;s pH
life work on a volunteer project I had
enough not knowing what to expect and
the next three months taught me a lot
about life each other late today being
Punjabi and he knew who grown up in Asia
listen to English and Hindi songs and
had some basic knowledge of mentoring I
should write it through this place my
ability to embrace diversity from a
young age helped me to connect with all
these people far away I start a social
enterprise project there that in Surrey
drug users educate and feed homeless
children now fast forward a year later
one fine day I received an email
United Nations in Geneva offered me an
opportunity to be part of a new team now
thank what rubbish spam but it wasn&#39;t
actually spam folder and I got another
email the next day we turns out do not
cut the next day the next week it turns
out the United Nations finally realized
that there in each organisation and
either develop into the young people so
they intended to create a youth win for
policymaking and there was somebody else
running I remember that lecture I told
you who helped me out he recommended me
for this role in spite filming in my
second year it&#39;s very full time who was
a full time role ladies and gentlemen
that was the first time I learned to
consciously value my origins and stand
up for who I am despite being always
food I was wrong I stood it from the UN
Human Rights Council and defended the
rights the education of young children
it might not have had any impact but it
made me feel better about myself cause I
knew who I was and that it was worth of
jihad changemakers which I engage young
people from around the globe to draft
policies which means rich from democracy
youth leadership corruption technology
education my words who graduated and I
had an impact I was respected but why
because I respected myself and
experiencing life as a token diversity
person helped me learn self-respect
which means I could help myself be
myself and be confident about myself
well being able to treat all others the
same that I would treat myself despite
us being so very fundamentally different
I believe did my passion I worked for it
even women agree here nothing to do this
business I received another surprise
I was headhunted by the royal family in
England it was the Queen&#39;s Diamond
Jubilee meaning she was 60s be Queen and
she had allocated sum of money to
empower young and Canada the previous
people in Commonwealth countries and
they were looking for a young person to
be in here
and based on my story they offered me a
full time role it&#39;s usually
fire altar I was a bit nervous but this
was definitely not because of my law
degree or my results not because of my
university this was not because of some
random context and you owe me a job
somewhere no this is because he knew me
for who I was
he saw me for me the work I do the
passion I carry in the luck that I share
needless to say I forgot this role in a
few years ago now here I&#39;m standing here
today and excerpts an advisor to a
Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second the
royal family I don&#39;t consider when I&#39;m
success I&#39;m on a journey with so much
more to learn and explore and I&#39;m loving
it so far I think so many ups and downs
on a daily basis and this journey has
made it easier for me to embrace
diversity and embrace the people and
experiences around me I hope that
sharing my humble adventures as cultural
Nomad has given you something take back
with you as children of today&#39;s world
and bracing average is both inevitable
and very beneficial
the more you allow it is your life the
more you will get out of it you know I
was drawn into the depths of it and I
did not have a choice you have a choice
and embracing diversity yes they are
buckwheat challenges and downsides to
diversity as there is for everything
it&#39;s about taking the good and leaving
the bed I owned it and it made me who I
am today and it gives me so much hope so
many dreams and hopes to work on you
have a choice whether to embrace
diversity diversity of everything ideas
races sexuality gender people ought to
reject it those who fail to ride this
wave will bring more inconvenience to
their personal and professional lives
and like to get a society I believe
you&#39;re all fighting our battles and we
can do it better when we have embracing
differences
around us so we can focus our energy on
bettering ourselves rather than focusing
our energies on being different and
drawing boundaries whether that&#39;s
individually in schools in universities
in countries across the globe in the
water can&#39;t dare to be wise on that note
thank you for everyone thank you for
listening to me everyone for spending
your time please feel free to get in
touch on Facebook Duque Kumar morning
[Applause]
