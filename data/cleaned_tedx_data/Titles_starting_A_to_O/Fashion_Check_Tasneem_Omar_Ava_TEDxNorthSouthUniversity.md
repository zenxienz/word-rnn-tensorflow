ethics to take pride in our selves and
our values or maybe sometimes to make
sure that our actions do not end up
hurting someone else
some of us follow ethics even in food
when we categorize ourselves into vegan
vegetarian and the lights and we follow
ethics in our everyday lives in our jobs
education relationships commitments
because all those activities somehow
have an impact has an effect on someone
else&#39;s life but have we ever considered
about following ethics in fashion do we
even need to follow ethics while buying
a simple dress well if the impact of
following an ethical practice in fashion
has an impact as dramatically tragic as
losing or taking away thousands of lives
maybe we have to reconsider this
question a very relevant that a very
unpleasant example of that would be the
Rana Plaza incident the fury call Rana
Plaza used to be one of the five
thousand different ready-made garment
factories in Bangladesh and over 3600
employees used to work for 16 hours
every day for as low as $2 a day of
income so the major European and
American fashion brands but what&#39;s my
daunting is the fact that for best
fashion brands these people were not
human beings they were simply cheap
labor who make the trendiest codes
available in stores within four days of
place in the order
inside we disastrously broken
infrastructure of Rana Plaza they used
to work for countless hours were
criminally little wage because they were
threatened by their employers that they
would be fired and let me tell you
should this people who earn barely a
dollar or two against almost a day of
work losing their jobs is more fearful
than losing their lives we may all
remember that on 24th April 2013 Rana
Plaza collapsed along with eleven
hundred and thirty-eight cheap labor
losing their lives and their dignity
this incident leads me to think about
modern-day slavery and the job practice
of private sector that practice
modern-day slavery like Rana Plaza and
the cripples the last at 1.2 billions of
people around the world who work in
factories don&#39;t like Rana Plaza and this
place a critical question to myself what
is my consumption pattern as a consumer
what is my ethics in fashion so I did
some further research and I tried to
find out and I was surprised as town to
find out that this cheap labor who
contribute majority to be precise eighty
percent to the expert industry of
Bangladesh they are despite contributing
this majority of majority in the expert
industry Obama - you&#39;re still trapped
and invisible in the informal economy
and the economic and social exclusion
limit still income to two to four
dollars back to coming from a favorable
and indecent working conditions and this
trend of modern-day slavery continues to
persist for years
because when I as a consumer use a quote
or use a new bag a new bunch of code I
never think of the outcome of this
unethical practice rather I keep
exploiting the benefits received
unimaginably trendy clothes available in
stores within one week but whether I
have been missing out on is the fact
that through my actions I have been
incentivizing the fast fashion brands to
indulge more into the profit making
business at the expense of compromising
on the freedom the dignity and basic
human rights of those hard-working
people ever since I could no longer take
pride on the fact that barovik
so that was the last time I thought
about Bangladesh and I realized that no
we better not take pride on the fact
that we supply the cheapest labor in the
world and that was the time I realized
that labor is never cheap the value that
we and the fast fashion grabs have been
paying to our labor is very cheap when I
recall the Rana Plaza incident again I
felt that I have been equally
responsible for that incident because
when I as a consumer threw away the
cheap price tags from a branded clothes
labelled as made in Bangladesh I never
asked myself who made this clothes so
cheap and I think a small global
citizens we all should ask those
questions
who made this clothes so cheap and to
what expense in return whether the
firm&#39;s who are starving half a day or
wizard someone&#39;s life this realizations
suddenly made me feel very powerful and
thus motivated me to be a social
entrepreneur and come up with my social
starter that would make this invisible
people visible and give them a global
identity by connecting them to ethical
fashion designers around the world it
made me realize that my epics and
fashion has the power to bring
hard-working people out of indifferent
working conditions and give them the
authority to make choices choices about
their working hours their wages their
contributions so I finally decided to
make a choice I made a choice that I
would stand up against the other
practice of fast fashion brands that
magnitudes the impact the effect of
modern-day slavery I made a choice to
stand up and uphold the rights of this
hard-working people while I clothed I
made a choice to follow epochs in
fashion because those of us who have the
power to make choices have to make
choices for those who do not have that
power and there were 1.2 billions of
people like that so I made my choice and
I&#39;ll end up with a question to all of
you will you follow ethics and fashion
the choice is yours
thank you
