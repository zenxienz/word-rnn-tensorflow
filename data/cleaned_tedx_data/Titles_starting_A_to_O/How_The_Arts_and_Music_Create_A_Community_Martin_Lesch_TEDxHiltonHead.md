what is the role of music in our
community when I was four years old a
piano showed up at my house and my
father had got his first Christmas bonus
my mother had convinced him to spend it
on buying a piano even though they were
broke and I begged for lessons but they
said you have to wait to your five so
when I was five and my fifth birthday
they gave me piano lessons I know it
doesn&#39;t sound like a great present but
that&#39;s what I wanted and I was just
hooked on the piano so for most of my
life I was concerned with what music
meant to me and how to hone my craft and
be in you know be the best musician I
could be I&#39;ve had some really you know
amazing moments on stage connecting with
my band members and with on audience and
I&#39;ve been very fortunate as my career
progressed I was fortunate to meet a lot
of great artistic minds in this business
and in relatable fields one of these
people was Bob masse teller who was the
founder of the Jazz corner down here in
Hilton Head when I met Bob we hit it off
immediately because we both loved jazz
music we both loved jazz history and we
liked to talk business and conceptional
ideas about business I got to know how
Bob how his mind worked he had an
amazing mind he&#39;s he was a true
visionary he usually began all his
endeavors with a dream and I call that a
dream because it was something that
seemed impossible to most of us then he
would utilize the talent he had
assembled to creatively figure out how
to accomplish each step necessary he was
never afraid to fail or adjust midstream
and he always maintained focus on the
goal which importantly was usually
something that benefited many and was
philanthropic in nature it was because
of this he few passion and those that
worked with him he always had a higher
purpose it was from Bob I started to see
the effect music and directly have on a
community did you know the economic
impact of music on Hilton Head runs into
the area of ten million dollars on our
little economy there are roughly 70
full-time musicians working in this area
that&#39;s more than Savannah or Charleston
a recent town study estimated that 220
full-time jobs are created as offshoots
of musical impact
here we can see the economic impact of
just the six largest arts organizations
on our local economy
and it runs into the tens of millions of
dollars did you know there are music
there are numerous musical outreach
programs in just our area that are
changing lives young and old through
education and entertaining so how does
the music of our island reflect our
community well first of all we have
everything from gull inspired choirs
like the Hallelujah singers with Marlena
smalls singing for presidents to Greg
Russell going 40 years strong down at
the Liberty oak to Van Slyke Cranford
Hollow touring the country representing
their own vision of the Low Country
sound we have consummate entertainers
like Reggie Dee&#39;s whom I work with
traveling the country as an
institutional act we&#39;ve cultivated
artists that have sold millions of
Records like Edwin McCain and Grammy
winners like Angie Aparo we have one of
the most renowned jazz venues in the
entire world in the jazz corner that&#39;s
an amazing feat you need a band to play
New Orleans music we have that a
world-class R&amp;B band we have it a big
band we have that to a reggae band a rap
producer we got it a Symphony Orchestra
we have an amazing symphony we should
all cherish and be proud of that
all these entities add up to our
collective song as a community this is
our melody and I promise you people are
listening
I hear from visitors all the time that
one of the reasons they come to Hilton
Head time and time again is to go to the
Jazz corner go to the Foskey and see
Cranford and in his band out there or
watch the International Piano
Competition which we&#39;re so fortunate to
have here I hear it all the time we need
to honor and embrace our artistic
identity and the potential it offers us
we&#39;re not just a gulf Beach in tennis
destination anymore we have much more to
offer and our vision must be much larger
it&#39;s time for us to focus and grow into
a cultural destination as well I&#39;m
convinced our prosperity depends upon it
and just like the vision boss Bob Nash
teller had of making a world-class jazz
jazz man you hear on Hilton Head and
when I first met him he told me about it
and I thought he was crazy but the
commitment necessary it will seem
controversial and will be risky in this
political climate but done successfully
the pay
economically socially and culturally
would be dramatic for example an
ancillary byproduct of something like
the jazz corners the junior jazz
foundation of which I&#39;m a board member
as a nonprofit with no paid staff within
the past year we provided over $25,000
in grants and scholarships to local
schools not even including our subsidy
of one of the island&#39;s finest arts
programs the Hilton Head jazz camp where
we have students from all over the
country come and study our national
community&#39;s first musical voice
jazz music we started the camp eight
years ago with nine students in this
past year we had over a hundred kids
from 11 different states here in the
island studying jazz with some of the
best educators and some of the best jazz
musicians in the world nearly half the
attendees were provided scholarships
from the junior jazz foundation the kids
love it and this year because of the
incredible support of our community we
were able to add college scholarships to
the grant to the camp attendees the
junior jazz all-stars are a group of
camp kids that live here locally and
perform here representing the program
and now the pride of Hilton Head on the
low country they&#39;re a group of phenoms
that have been given the resources to
rise to new heights they&#39;re an example
of the program working the standards are
being raised and the schools are
learning they can count on us to help
improve their musical their music
programs this is an example of the value
of music we are working to make sure our
community song continues and standards
remain high the fruition of this vision
for me personally in addition to the
educational aspect of the Hilton Head
jazz is the Hilton Head jazz for all
ages Jazz Festival by partnering with
the Sonesta Resort our sponsors have
been able to provide a venue for
performers in a place to stay while the
festivals held ultimately we&#39;re trying
to add another yearly attraction to the
island this year we celebrated the music
of New Orleans the first night with the
living legends of New Orleans
accompanied by the islands own Chris
Bukowski on piano one of the finest
traditional jazz pianists in the world
today who started out as a young kid
right here on Hilton Head sitting in at
the Jazz corner the second night of the
festival was postponed to due to a
hurricane Irma and will be held November
3rd
featuring Joe grandson and multi-grammy
winter Carmen Bradford I urge you all to
make the effort to go out and find music
we have this amazing resource that is
still largely underutilized as part of
our islands identity insist on the
rebranding this insist that the
rebranding of the island privately
include the arts cultural tourism
represents a huge untapped source of
revenue for the future of our area these
resources are already in place we simply
need to foster them and promote them it
won&#39;t just lead to more expenditures for
the average visitor but cultural tourism
has been showed to attract a broad
demographic of young and old
international and national and study
after study additionally through
expanding our arts culture and history
we will continue to attract year-round
residents well into the future
Golf Beach and tennis are wonderful but
it just won&#39;t be enough we must grow and
expand our offerings to keep attracting
people in all kind of investments to the
island now many of you might never have
been to the symphony shows or the jazz
corner or even the tiki hut or the
community concerts held for free right
across the street here go you&#39;ll realize
what an amazing arts and historical
community we have we&#39;re an exception in
a special place in these regards we need
to develop these resources further and
there&#39;s plenty of area for growth in
these areas now earlier I was naming
many of the types of music you can find
on the island I left out a couple of
things which our bluegrass kid shows an
80s rock any of you many of you out
there might know Jeb and Daley and Gary
Pratt from
Low Country boil bluegrass fan and also
their alter egos silicone sister sure
some of you you don&#39;t want to admit to
it but you&#39;ve seen them and this is Joe
Vickers from unicorn meat and formerly
of trophy wife and about a million bands
and Joe plays about ten different
instruments and it&#39;s rare that you can
go to someplace like the tiki hut in
another town and watch somebody sit
there in place sitar and which is
something you can see with Joe I didn&#39;t
have him bring that today so so I&#39;m
gonna finish things off by asking them
to perform a song that Jevon and Gary
wrote and they play with Low Country
boil and this is a song that they wrote
about the low country it&#39;s called pollen
thank you for listening and remember to
go out and catch the music
