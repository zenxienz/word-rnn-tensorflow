once upon a time we were all children we
had hiding places and crooked little
corners that became our castles are
caves fortresses and caverns we used to
love jumping into mud puddles which
became our oceans and seas rivers and
streams once upon a time we were all
children and anything was possible a
rope could be a snake a stick a want the
floor cushion a bus Bob Bob and a
bathroom sink could be a pond like I
said anything was possible for a child
today was yesterday yesterday was so
many days ago because their sense of
time isn&#39;t accurate and thus infinite
numbers do not exist in their world play
is limitless and possibility ever
available that too for free until one
day these lands of wonder are invaded by
treacherous villains us you and I all of
us and suddenly we fill these wonderful
worlds with expectations of all sorts
big and small all sorts we bombard their
lands with numbers and figures facts
answers questions additions subtractions
multiples divisible x&#39; and it goes on
and on and on we expect them to sit
straight in classrooms listen to the
teacher form straight lines and to my
horror in a lot of places at the tender
age of 3 4 &amp; 5 appear in examination
halls and produce results if they do not
measure up to our expectations we do
something not right
we often ridicule them we shame them
we demean them we criticize them and in
this process somewhere we keep telling
them that they&#39;re not good enough
without realizing that this is killing
their sense of self that this is
damaging them and their belief in
themselves we forget that these children
are something there are somebody today
but we are so focused on making them
something tomorrow that we do not let
them be who they are today
this damage stays with us often forever
I think we all have at some point and
the audit and I believe that it can be
prevented but in order for us to do that
we first need to fix the damage and
that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to talk about today
how we can fix these damages that we&#39;ve
endured as children and that children
these days do endure themselves as well
but before I get to that I will share
with you a small story about a girl who
was rather undiscovered till the age of
17 or 18 she was uh she was she could
sing and dance and act he was rather
talented um but numbers didn&#39;t quite
make sense to her chemical equations
weren&#39;t really her best friends and so
she was often discouraged in in
classrooms by her teachers whenever she
would raise her hand twice or thrice to
ask the dirt the science or math teacher
or something and they would say why are
you not understanding this are you
trying to play with me and she would be
like what no I&#39;m just asking you this
and so this just kept going on and until
she started believing that maybe
something really was wrong with her that
maybe she was lacking at something and
so throughout academic year she started
shutting herself little by little
as results became this shy and unsure
child she started believing that she
could not do much she forgot about her
talents because they were never really
honed in school and she became rather
lonely until one day she found something
that cured her something that I would
say was art in all its color and
vibrancy that was sport in the exercise
that was there was math in its
measurement of time and space that was
science and the understanding of beings
that was geography and places felt and
experienced that was history in
characters note and delivered that was
language I would say very human centric
because it was so communicative and
adaptive it was an inter disciplinary
it was theatre and that girl was I and
this happened on a very regular evening
somewhere in 2005 when by chance I was
attending a theatre workshop and this
the workshop conductor says to me oh yes
please your name out loud what is he
saying what does he mean out loud how
can I say my name out loud and I looked
at him like that and he said it&#39;s okay
woman we&#39;re not going to eat you and I
okay yeah you&#39;re right and I try to fix
my shirt and I was all fidgety and
nervous and unsure and I said Sara Zarr
here well he looked at me like really um
a bit louder I&#39;m pretty sure you can do
this come on just give it a try okay
[Music]
Salizar head I said Wow and in that
moment I felt so liberated I had just
said my name out loud that was it
but I felt like I had unlocked myself
like like my voice and myself that I had
been hiding for years and years and
years just opened up in that one little
second when I spoke my name in front of
a bunch of people and then just like
that I was asked to jump and walk around
and I was asked what a pen could be and
I thought hmm it could be a cotton bud
or a telescope or it could be a stick
that bricks it could be anything which
meant that anything was possible which
meant that I had just in that moment
gotten back my world of possibility that
world that I lost somewhere
when I was a child I had just been given
back my castles and caves my fortresses
my pools and rivers and streams and it
was wonderful the world had just opened
itself to me and I to it so right after
graduating I decided that it was
something on the same lines that I
wanted to do and I decided to teach
because I thought that I need to engage
with students I need to engage with
children and tell them that whoever they
are is enough because if they believe in
themselves they can be anything anything
at all and I started teaching and I
started delivering my lectures and souls
all sorts of interactive ways because I
thought that children sleeping at the
back in a lecture not right so it should
be animating it and it should be vibrant
and it should be something that they
enjoy and I guess during all the years
that I taught this subject that I was
teaching I was some somewhat are able to
achieve that but the real moment of
happiness came when in 2010 I was asked
to teach at a junior and middle school
for girls as a teacher for theater and I
thought this is it and since then
it&#39;s gonna be seven years now I have
been walking into classrooms and I&#39;ve
been looking at these girls who look so
much like me back in the day with with
with them not so sure about themselves
with them thinking they&#39;re not good
enough with them little afraid and a
little shy and a little introverted and
I tell them yes your name please
out loud and they give me the same kind
of expressions I gave my instructor back
then and ice worse than the situation
when I say could you jump for me and
they look at me like oh my god this
woman is crazy she&#39;s asking us to jump
what is wrong with her and they roll
their eyes at me and exchange glances
and I just Alex Jim you see it&#39;s that
simple I just did this I am turning 30
to next week I have two children and I&#39;m
a little fat if I just did this you will
if I can do this you will and they&#39;re
somewhere over there they smile and they
giggle and laugh and they jump and that
right there is there a gateway to a new
world a world that asks them to be
anything they want to be a world where
they&#39;re not so afraid they&#39;re not so shy
where they can just be without being
judged without having to produce a
result and have a star shining on them
they can just be themselves and have fun
and engage in talks with each other and
exchange stories and connect with each
other and so I thought this needs to be
further taken down somewhere which is
why I sat back two years ago and I
thought I need to come up with a theater
company of my own and I did myself and
my husband we founded a small little
theatre company that&#39;s called chota
motor theater
[Applause]
and so de moda theater is basically a
platform with this incredible team of
enthusiastic people that we have working
with us it&#39;s a platform that wants to
encourage people to join it that is it
people of all ages ethnicities color
background profession no matter who you
are all you need to do is come and do
some theater because really we could all
catch a break really we all need to
engage with ourselves and with each
other and realize that we&#39;ve stopped
wandering that we have stopped thinking
beyond our boxes that we&#39;ve stopped
engaging with all of our senses that we
have stopped living moments like they
should be lived and this is why I would
say that if I so many years ago I would
have given up on myself if theatre had
not found me but I&#39;m so glad it did
because otherwise I would have been so
lost therefore I urge you all all of you
to do theater because life is it should
be about living not just existing and
theater that&#39;s what it does it reminds
you then life should be lived not by
some of us but all of us you and I all
of us thank you
you
