courage it&#39;s not the absence of fear
it&#39;s choosing to lean into it
fear is an amazing emotion on one hand
it&#39;s the thing that keeps us safe and
alive on the other hand when we do
choose to lean into it that&#39;s when we
actually feel alive I&#39;ve been fortunate
to spend the last 15 or 20 years of my
personal and professional life being
surrounded by some of the world&#39;s best
athletes coaches sports scientists
leaders in education and business and
there&#39;s four key elements that continue
to emerge from what I learn from them
and it&#39;s all backed by the research of
Albert bandura deechi and Ryan Carol
Dweck and many others I look forward to
sharing these four ideas with you in
hopes that we can carry them together
one of the greatest leaders of all time
in my opinion dr. Martin Luther King jr.
says at best the ultimate measure of a
man is not where he stands in moments of
comfort and convenience but where he
stands at times of challenge and
controversy talk about a man who must
have lived much of his adult life in
fear this guy gets it and I think we do
to our best moments in life aren&#39;t spent
sitting comfortably on the couch by
ourselves watching the television it&#39;s
choosing to lean into challenges and
this is where I&#39;m going to begin
challenge is actually your friend when
we think about it from a physical sense
it&#39;s the only way we get stronger if I&#39;m
to stand here and I&#39;m gonna lift one
pound dumbbells five times
it&#39;s cannot not going to do a lot for me
and also look at me right if I try to
lift 350 over my head it&#39;s going to hurt
me but it&#39;s not going
give me great gains so in a physical
sense we can appreciate it&#39;s about
finding that weight that gives us a
little shake a little sweat and gets
this thing going and our mental and
emotional I it&#39;s the same exact thing so
what I&#39;m encouraging all of us to do is
find those challenges find those things
that get you going a little bit and lean
into them
what&#39;s also kind of important in these
moments is what we&#39;re saying to
ourselves so on the surface this idea oh
this will be easy I got it
sounds like a good idea until and it&#39;s
not so easy is it we&#39;re left feeling
unprepared overwhelmed and we fold this
might be tough don&#39;t mess it up we&#39;re
getting there we&#39;ve got the first half
of the sentence right we&#39;re appreciating
the challenge of the moment yet this
part about don&#39;t messing it up that&#39;s
what holds us back most of the time in
order to truly live a courageous life
you have to be willing to fail and this
is what I tell my athletes all the time
I respect that they&#39;re out there and
they&#39;re doing their thing in front of
everybody and they&#39;re willing to fail
they have to be the final mindset that I
do encourage this will be tough go for
it
this is us leaning into that fear this
is us embracing the challenge and we
when we appreciate that something&#39;s hard
we do kind of accept that I might mess
this up and that&#39;s okay but also when we
do admit that it&#39;s going to be difficult
our focus goes up and we&#39;re brought to
the present moment and we&#39;re ready to
take on the challenge that&#39;s in front of
us
courage it&#39;s not the absence of fear
it&#39;s choosing to lean into it the second
idea I&#39;d like to share with you this
evening is the perception how we think
about our feelings so in my heart starts
beating shaking a little bit
sweating a little bit if I&#39;m on my heels
that&#39;s anxiety but what does excitement
feel like isn&#39;t it actually exactly the
same so we actually choose believe it or
not you get to choose what to do with
your emotions courage it&#39;s not the
absence of fear it&#39;s choosing to lean
into it the third idea is purpose
Mark Twain says it best the two most
important days of your life or the day
you were born and the day you find out
why purpose is our anchor and it really
helps us in two ways so if we wake up in
the morning and we&#39;re feeling uninspired
and we&#39;re not really ready to take
action reminding ourselves of our
purpose why am I here what am I here for
what am i built to do that helps us take
the first step it gets us ready and also
to the other side of it when we are
caught in the storms of life and things
feel difficult and we are overwhelmed
that sense of purpose reminds us right
here is actually where I&#39;m supposed to
be I&#39;m doing this for a reason bigger
than myself
purpose is a powerful thing
courage it&#39;s not the absence of fear
it&#39;s choosing to lean into it and the
fourth idea might be the most important
of them all connect we need each other
the worst punishment that our government
can put on us aside from the death
penalty solitary confinement to be alone
secluded and to feel lonely that&#39;s
painful it hurts not physically but
emotionally having those around us is so
integral to our success and to our
courage and while Facebook it&#39;s a
brilliant idea
multimillion-dollar business but it&#39;s
also about the depth of our connections
is what really makes the biggest
difference it&#39;s not about the amount of
people in our lives it&#39;s more about the
quality and depth of the relationships
that we have because what I&#39;m
encouraging you to lean into these
challenges and lean into your fears we
need each other I use the example of a
safety net now our social network is
just that confidence is not walking into
the room thinking you&#39;re the best one
their confidence is more about knowing
that when things get ugly when things
get tough I&#39;m going to be okay and it&#39;s
our connections it&#39;s our network it&#39;s
our community our tribe is what creates
that for us so what I&#39;m do as
individuals and as a community
choose challenge be excited seek purpose
and stay connected
courage it&#39;s not the absence of fear
it&#39;s choosing to lean into it thank you
