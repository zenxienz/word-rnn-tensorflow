I believe in hi sensitive power I think
that the natural-born skills of the high
sensitive people are perfect for
building our future and why I think so
that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to explain to you
in next minutes by taking you with me
through some memories of mine and some
discoveries I made up till now I would
start with my first memory I was about 1
sitting on the floor in the living room
on the carpet the carpet was blue curly
carpet with green lines in it and it was
a black sky couch
there was a rosewood cupboard and it was
something with the light the light was a
little vibrating like on a summer&#39;s day
and all felt at ease nice a few years
later I was about four I was observing
everything actually I am a curious one I
was it in birth and I was observing
people and people who talked and I
sensed all kinds of things so when I saw
something someone coming I heard they&#39;re
talking and I sensed a headache or
stomach ache or so if someone was joyful
or angry or very sad or too busy and
what I saw was that people only reacted
to each other on the spoken words and
for example some day that came a friend
of my mother&#39;s in and the moment she
came in I felt oh she&#39;s in grief and my
mother went to to where and she said and
how are you today and suddenly she
smiles and she says oh I&#39;m so joyful and
then the talk went on and on about
joyful being which was not
and if puzzled me and I tried to ask my
mother how come why do you only react on
the spoken words but I was so little I
didn&#39;t have the words to ask her and my
mother didn&#39;t understand me and there I
was I didn&#39;t understand the world and
the world didn&#39;t understand me luckily I
had the brains and they saved me so I
observed and I observed and I I found
out that things of the head were
accepted its things of the senses were
difficult not handy there were no words
for for my senses over or all the
perceptions I had so I tried to fit in
like every little kid and I chose the
way of the head and part of me the
sensing part of me became very little
hidden inside of me in my armor like
Paul Simon wrote a song about in the
brain part I succeeded to fit in I did
my education and I became a lawyer
I married like a children and at the age
of 35 I divorced and then I thought ha
now I can feel again and then help came
down upon me because I felt everything I
couldn&#39;t read the newspapers I couldn&#39;t
look at photographs I couldn&#39;t look at a
television and the worst thing was I
couldn&#39;t be no longer than two hours in
the room when there were more than six
people but I had to take care of myself
and my four children
so that wasn&#39;t handy and realizing that
I couldn&#39;t be most of the day completely
overwhelmed by all those perceptions
realizing that I was the only one who
was responsible for my life and of my
children in the little years I started a
quest because I had to handle this and
the first thing I found was high
sensitivity and I thought I sensitivity
I know
but yes I filled in the list yes yes yes
yes yes I thought oh yes what am I going
to do with it and realizing I had those
two parts those two worlds I tried to to
handle it
by approaching it by the two worlds so
in the world of my brain I wanted to
know everything I collected all the
scientific studies there were and there
were a lot and so I found out it was not
an disorder it was a trait like having
my blonde hair or my blue eyes and it&#39;s
just about having a more sensitive
central nervous system and his central
nervous system receives more and
processes deeper so it&#39;s sooner it&#39;s
full and sooner in stress but the deep
processing takes care of an empathic
skills of thinking out of the box of
being very fast to the core of the
problem being creative in doing or in
thinking and it was found with fifty to
twenty percent of the human beings and
not only the
beings because they have found they have
studied more than a hundred species up
till now and we have exactly the same
person percentage 15 to 20 percent of a
population has a highly sensitive nerve
system and it has a function it has the
function to bring the group as a whole
to the future because this part of the
group senses more and senses deeper
senses sooner so in the early days they
knew whether water was when the winter
was coming where the food was if the
food was ripe and now we can use these
skills like creativity hanging out of
the box in our society now so we can
bring our group data to the future in
the part of my sensing play my sensing
part that was difficult because I
haven&#39;t lived there I send so kind of
things but how did I handle them
properly I hadn&#39;t learned it so I
thought Who am I and what do I do with
all these perceptions and I learned this
way but maybe there&#39;s another way a
better way and so I went on searching
exploring myself and I in fact I wrote a
complete new manual how to live with
Jacqueline and in all it took me 10
years to fully integrate those two
worlds in the meantime in my
professional life I was one day standing
in court defending a party and
I looked at the other part and they were
lying to the judge not a little bit but
tremendously lying and I was astonished
I saw and I looked at a judge and the
judge believed it and then I realized I
couldn&#39;t be a lawyer anymore
so I went on to mediation and gone to
coaching and in the coaching I saw
people falling out of their jobs with
stress complaints the physical
complaints psychic complaints burnout
pour outs and a lot of them were high
sensitive I could see it I could feel it
and when I asked them have you ever
thought of the idea maybe being high
sensitive they said I know but after a
week they said oh yes I think I&#39;m high
sensitive and what do I do now and then
I I told him two clues and I could
really fast return to their jobs or find
another job
that suited better and they wrote our
own manual because it&#39;s very necessary
but it went all right in a short time
and I saw school dropout and school
dropouts verse 16 sometimes younger I
want to tell you a story about that and
an example of a seven-year-old girl she
told me a few months ago she said we had
this the teacher showed us a big
photograph of a butterfly she says it
was beautiful she said it&#39;s large
butterfly and you saw all those hairs
and the the list of the pores and all
the shades of the brown in the hairs
going to the green all kinds of shades
of green go
into blue and down a little black and
white and and the teacher asked how many
colors does this butterfly have and she
said and I said thousands and the
teacher said wrong it&#39;s only five and I
asked her what did you say and she said
I didn&#39;t say anything because the
teacher only sees five but it happens
every day to these children and by the
time they&#39;re 16 they&#39;ve had it with the
school they can&#39;t learn anymore there so
what to do something else so the
coaching I did a short time and then I
was complaining about all the high
sensitive people who didn&#39;t see
themselves and the world that didn&#39;t see
them and that it costs a lot of money
and that people are so unhappy what
wasn&#39;t necessary but a complaining
doesn&#39;t solve the problem so I start at
our Institute where we now Adid nowadays
teach professionals like therapists or
teachers people who work with people how
to work with the high sensitive and
gifted people because it&#39;s not yet in
education and it&#39;s necessary to
recognize die sensitivity what a
giftedness because then this group can
develop the skills and then they can
develop themselves so they can use the
skills in the job advertisements
nowadays there is asked for loyal
trustworthy honest people who can think
out of the box who are creative and
who are empathic because they need to
glue into organizations those are
exactly the skills of the high sensitive
people so the shortest way to to use
these skills is to to use the high
sensitive people to see them to let them
develop their skills and develop their
sense of self so what I want to ask you
is when you go home recognize the high
sensitive people recognize your family
your neighbor your colleague your friend
or yourself and acknowledge it
acknowledge them and so they can develop
they can let our gifts grow and we can
use them as a whole to build a perfect
happy future thank you
