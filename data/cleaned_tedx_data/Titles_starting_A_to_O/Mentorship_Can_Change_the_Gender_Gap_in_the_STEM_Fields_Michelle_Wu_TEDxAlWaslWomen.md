you
in 2003 just two years into my career
the first job I ever had I was in a
technical field I was confused I was
insecure I wasn&#39;t really sure being a
technical field was a right for me in
2005 I want to prove my own sound words
I went a nap I went out and purchased my
first house which is four times more
than what I was making I was crazy in
2007 I moved to New York City because I
wanted to feel I was in control of my
own life
I major in finance and marketing 180
degrees completely different from what I
was doing technical fields in 2012 I
moved to the Middle East who said I
wanted to feel unbeatable this four
major events was really pivotal points
in my own career I had almost how to
exit the technical fields many people
asked me why what kept me there I mentor
my mentor Eric has never criticized me
even though he knew I was crazy he never
really told me I was doing anything
incredibly wrong but he always gave me
constructive feedback when I was age of
23 I went through my first major
corporation restructuring I felt at a
bottom of my career Eric told me
Michelle I will always have you on my
team
without a heartbeat his simple worst
boosted my confidence to the highest
level I could never imagine I felt a
sense of belonging in the male-dominated
area in 2005 he didn&#39;t say I was crazy
he set me down and mapped through my
entire finance make sure I understood
how to pay monthly mortgage he mentioned
how much passive income I must have
every money in order to make living I
had a boat I&#39;m job
I still have to have someone set me
through to do it in 2007
Eric me I want to feel in control in my
life he connected with an opportunity
near New York City so I could go to work
during the day go to school during the
night in 2012
Eric gave me an advice took a leap of
faith I left the job and the company I
have worked for 10 years I moved to
Middle East without an opportunity three
months later I returned to the same
company returned to this back to the
Stanfield&#39;s Eric has always been there
to support me till today I am still
doing my own serve so searching is the
tonic also right feel from me every year
this morning almost 50% of a woman
entering the workforce but a time they
reach director level the percentage drop
another 14% but a time the roots VP and
above it drop additional 4% the chance
force women in stamp is even smaller
there&#39;s only 34 percent of a woman
entering the Stanfill every year stem
stands for science technology
engineering and mathematics by the time
women reach VPN and above the percentage
is already left to 22 percent that means
above VP all the Corporations
regardless of what you are at across the
world are men when women&#39;s are in the
tech intensive fields especially they
have a business roles they have a higher
chance of leaving for other industry
than men women are leaving at 53 percent
versus a men at 31 percent and then when
women reached a tenure in their career
they start to lead the industry why is
this so hard to get women into the stand
field and is even harder for them to
retain in the industry we asked many
women dimension sense of the isolation
sense of belonging lack of a feedback
from senior executive leaders or lack of
sponsorship all the points from the
women are very very crucial and very
important well
can we do to change the gender gap
because it&#39;s not a new news it&#39;s
actually being happening the ratio
hasn&#39;t changed for decades my Bui mentor
sure can help mentorship is something
that we can control especially with
women pipeline one in 17 women choose to
entering university choose majoring in
STEM fields only one in five men would
choose the stem field as well
the women ratio is much slimmer compared
to men and women have higher tendency to
read to leave the stem field by the time
they graduate PNAS is a nonprofit
organizations for science and
engineering that publishes a study over
150 engineering women they&#39;re partnered
with the mentors female or male or no
Mentors they observe and throughout the
four years throughout the college the
women who have female mentors tend to
graduate with the STEM fields they have
more confidence they have less anxiety
and they&#39;ve gained self-efficacy the
women who have no mentors throughout the
four years here in the college time they
meet they switch mentor
so that&#39;s one of the main reason I&#39;m so
passionate about having mentorship with
University students so a we&#39;re men
working at I set up up two mentorship
program in UAE and Saudi Arabia
I stood up with two amazing women&#39;s that
have a same passion for a university
pipeline so far we have mentor over 45
students from UAE and Saudi our own
objective and our goal is to make sure
this woman graduated with the
Stanfield&#39;s seal the sense of a belong
and where they can be in the stem the
male-dominated area and also graduate
with this technical degree mentors that
can only help the pipeline mentorship
can also help develop women in the early
and me career
McKenzie and Lincoln recently published
a study women are less likely to
interact with senior leaders yet those
who do are more likely to be promoted
women are also less likely to interact
with senior leaders yet those who do
more more likely to be aspired to be
executive leaders I was lucky enough to
have Eric in my life when I was 23 when
I went for my first organisation
restructuring I didn&#39;t know what to do
he gave me the exposure the knowledge
and advice for me to continue that to
the thrive if mentorship is so important
to me so important to so many women why
only one in eight women has a mentor you
asked women why some women said because
the family obligation had intensified
especially the women the 30s in the 40s
or they were tell you they have never
been asked it is so important to so many
of us why are we waiting to be asked
mentorship can also help change the
gender gaps when we turn mentors into
sponsors sponsor is somebody who is high
level in love in the organization we&#39;re
anywhere with exposure is ready to
advocate for your promotions a mentor is
somebody who has an industry knowledge a
few expertise can guide you through
along the the career in 2015 I face
obstacle because I was looking for to
move up in the organization I reached
out to a senior leader in my
organization and I asked him to be my
mentor I told him exactly what I wanted
it but I also asked him to give me
feedback he guided me through give me
constructive feedback the relationship I
had with this particular mentor is very
formal and very corporate light we may
not have a lot of chemistry but the 15
minutes Bunco I had with him every
is the most beneficial phone call I ever
had my career
he helped me connected to different
channels allows me to gain an exposure
I couldn&#39;t have before which led to
where I am today as a CIO for business
unfortunately this ratio for
corporations that more than 78% of the
men on the top the minimis syndrome tend
to stay strong a man in a top tend to
groom another men on a bottom to become
a meeting me well we can change that if
a mentor can turn to a sponsor hold a
woman up or ports a different type of a
diversity of we can start singing the
change so what can you do today if
you&#39;re a women in your career you don&#39;t
have a mentor go out today and ask for a
mentor if you are in your mid career
already have a mentor then give someone
else a chance pay it forward mentor a
young lady in university make sure they
have enough self sustained and then of
of confidence to finish their field in
the STEM fields if you already make it
to the top regards to her men or women
offer your time and mentor the next
generation pull them out the ladders
give them the time and advice they need
and given the exposure in that where
they couldn&#39;t have on their own I always
believe we all have a power to change
everything around us collectively would
just start mentoring one young woman
today you can start so many ripple
effect we can change the gender racial
we can change their attrition and we can
change the woman pipeline I always say
true to myself because that&#39;s really
important to me my mentee has changed me
how I see mentorship my mentee was going
through a career challenges but I was
able to tell her you know this is what
you can do differently what do you want
to see change of where you are at
she made a career change and still stay
in the stem field for me that is
empowering because I could see how my
mentee has changed empower me to be a
better mentee when I interacting my
mentor so today that&#39;s a walk away
mentor someone else collectively we can
become a really strong force thank you
very much
[Applause]
