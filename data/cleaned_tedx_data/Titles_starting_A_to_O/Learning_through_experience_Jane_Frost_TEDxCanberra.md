thank you
hello everybody well there&#39;s a lot of
you today isn&#39;t there well my name&#39;s
Marjorie and Marjorie Templeton and I go
into the university and I talk to the
students there I used to be a nurse you
know and I go in and I talk about my
experiences because I have some health
problems well at at 81 who hasn&#39;t and my
my husband Jacques has the Parkinson&#39;s
and I&#39;ve cared for him for a long time
but he&#39;s had to go into a nursing home
now so that&#39;s a bit sad but I&#39;ve got
something to show you today
let me see if I can find it I don&#39;t know
if you&#39;ve seen one of these before and
it&#39;s got a bit of a funny name so this
is called a fidget mouth and it&#39;s it&#39;s
supposed to be for people with with the
Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia it it&#39;s quite
soothing so I I bought it for my husband
jock because he has the tremor in the
Parkinson&#39;s and yes I thought it might
help but I ordered it on the Google and
it came it was pink I thought I&#39;d
ordered brown so I might just have to
keep it myself and hope that it stops me
getting the Alzheimers what do you think
yes well I thought I&#39;d tell you a story
I tell my students
and that&#39;s about going to the when I see
the diabetic doctor because I have the
diabetes and I went a few weeks ago with
my grandson Louie so he&#39;s only small and
before we went in I I went I took him to
the cafe and he got one of those big
sticky doughnuts yes you know the ones
full of sugar well I&#39;m a grandma I&#39;m
allowed to give him it anyway I went I
went to the clinic and the woman that
was taking my blood sugar said have you
had one of those
I said no I said I&#39;m coming to the
diabetic clinic anyway she took my blood
glucose and she went oh it&#39;s normal and
I said yes
well I didn&#39;t have one you didn&#39;t
believe me did you and she said no and I
thought well you know I might be old but
I&#39;m not silly I&#39;d left mine in my
handbag for when I left yes
anyway I I think I have to go now
there&#39;s a clock down here that&#39;s telling
me to leave so I better get off there&#39;s
someone that I work with it&#39;s coming on
next I believe so
just just a moment
[Applause]
so I&#39;m not Margery Templeton my name&#39;s
Jane frost and I&#39;m going to come and
talk to you about why I use mascara in a
moment I&#39;m just going to slip into
something more comfortable
our dish is a completely realized person
like she is a real patient sitting there
with you which is such a cool
opportunity because in the other labs
they&#39;re high fidelity dummies but
they&#39;re not alive but Marjorie&#39;s like
this real live breathing person they get
to me you never fit get any questions to
ask her because she comes back and back
and you can cover so much stuff things I
really enjoyed about Marjorie coming
into the class was the fact that it is a
person you can engage with and it
connects you more with the content that
we&#39;re being taught each week
Marjorie goes along with the subject
matter we&#39;re trying to learn that week
and for me being someone who enjoys
learning that way it made it a lot
easier to take in the content and make
it stick a little bit better you thought
she was real I think she was real oh
people in the class she&#39;s completely
real
it&#39;s scary well it&#39;s not often that you
get to a teacher that&#39;s go on full Meryl
Streep into character and it&#39;s going to
the effort it&#39;s got just so much effort
to just try and teach you something in a
fun way that everybody
I&#39;d like you to think about kindness
compassion and communication and how
important that is for healthcare
professionals I&#39;d like you to think at
the last time you had an interaction
with the healthcare professional and
think about whether it was good or
whether it was bad and I hasten to guess
that the reason that it was either good
or bad was because of the communication
and the connection you felt with that
healthcare professional Maya Angelou
famously said that people don&#39;t remember
what you say and they often don&#39;t
remember what you do they remember how
you make them feel and this is really
important
I teach nursing students and nurses are
the health care professional that spends
the most time with patients research in
the United States has shown that
kindness and compassion improve health
outcomes they reduce blood pressure it
reduces wound healing times reduces
anxiety it the shorter stays in hospital
and even it affects the severity and the
duration of the common cold my research
has linked communication with
empowerment and enablement and I found
that a mutual respect trust and a good
communication style linked with patients
being able to cope or understand and
manage their illness better but how do
we teach it or how do you learn how to
communicate if you think back to when
you were growing up you learned through
experience you learned through practice
and you learnt from that through the
feedback that you were given remember
when you learn to say something and you
practice it with your mom or your
parents with your peers and the reaction
that you got made you realize whether
you actually got your message across
being able to practice and that learning
through experience is why I bring
Marjorie into my classroom Marjorie is a
character that I&#39;ve created through a
technique called mask ed mask edge was
developed by Professor Carrie Reed sue
at the central Queensland University and
I learned how to do this technique in
2013 and I can honestly say that
transformed the way that I teach I was
able to see an engagement with my
students and you can see from the video
that they really get involved with
Marjorie they like learning this way and
how much more do you learn when you&#39;re
having fun
Marjorie it&#39;s a mixture of people that I
know and people that I&#39;ve missed
Marjorie is a mixture of all these
people and that means that I can make
her real I&#39;ve been a nurse for over 20
years and I&#39;ve had a chronic illness for
over 30 years and that experience allows
me to portray a patient experience that
students can then engage with mosket is
safe it&#39;s effective and it allows you to
coach students as they are learning they
can practice communication in lots of
ways but Marjorie isn&#39;t my only
character I have some other characters
as you can see on the slide these are
all me so we have Elsie who comes into
our workshop and teaches the students
about correct ID correctly identifying a
patient and that&#39;s really important when
we&#39;re giving medication you need to
correctly identify the patient and
that&#39;s hard to learn on a mannequin that
doesn&#39;t interact with you
Hildur on here was in an
interprofessional learning experience
that we ran and Hilda had had a hip
replacement
now during that experience she needed to
have her hip dressed now I&#39;ll just
mention there that mask edge involves
the use of silicon props and masks so
you wear a mask but you can also wear
different parts of the body - so Hilda
had a hip wound she was in bed in her
nightie one of the nursing students was
doing a wound dress dressing on that hip
wound so she had her backside exposed
and some other students came over and
asked Hilda if they could take a health
history and poor Hilda went oh yeah
suppose so because she was vulnerable
and she was in that bed and she thought
as most patients do I should really
answer all these questions they&#39;re
helping me but when I was when I took
the mask off I was then able to debrief
with the students and say hey did he
think about dignity there did he think
about how vulnerable she was feeling and
when they said she said it was okay yeah
but you need to think about that more
you need to reflect on what you&#39;re doing
and that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re teaching
through experience is about reflecting
and getting it right the next time on
the premise of learning through
experience I asked my students to do
some other things so one of the things I
asked them to do is to wear a colostomy
bag I asked them to wear a colostomy bag
for 24 to 48 hours and I fill it with
fake feces makes it a bit more realistic
and the idea is that they wear this bag
and they go out and they just go about
their normal lives when they come back
the following week they say things like
I had to take it off I went to the gym
it won&#39;t fit under my gym clothes I had
to take it off because I didn&#39;t want it
to leak in the bed and they have
interesting
stories of how partners didn&#39;t want to
come with them when they have this bag
on that was fake and then I get them to
reflect on the fact that patients who
need colostomy bags don&#39;t have the
choice to take it off and I&#39;ve asked
them to walk in their shoes for a small
amount of time another thing that I
asked my students to do is to wear a
bariatric suit now a bariatric suit is a
suit that almost doubles the size of the
body and bulks the body out and allows
people to experience what it would be
like to be in the obese category or to
be categorized as being obese and this
has been really powerful for some of our
students because they realize that they
had thought about obesity differently
and they had all the answers they were
going to get people to go for a run they
put on the suit they can&#39;t reach their
toes or they find it difficult to put
their shoes on and there&#39;s a moment
there that they realize that they needed
to step in someone else&#39;s shoes and
think about the person when I first
started nursing I was ridiculed by some
of my colleagues because I was looking
after someone who had who was in a coma
and as I was looking after them I was
talking to them I was chatting away
about the weather I held their hands as
I did their observation and my
colleagues at the time said you know why
are you bothering to do that and I
thought if there is just the slightest
chance that this person can hear me
talking or feel my touch then that is
what I would want someone to do for me
and why does this all matter to you
everybody in this audience is going to
be touched by a nurse at some point
whether it&#39;s for a flu jab whether it&#39;s
for a longer stay in hospital and one
thing&#39;s for sure as we all get older
we&#39;re going to be needing health care
more and more frequently don&#39;t you want
that nurse to recognize you as a person
and not just your illness
and I&#39;m going to leave you with a quote
from JK Rowling and a famous wizard
words are our most inexhaustible source
of magic capable of inflicting great
harm but also of remedying it thank you
[Applause]
