it&#39;s really cold I was trying to warm up
back there didn&#39;t really work very well
so let me take you back to 2012 an
accident happen really and I want to
emphasize this was an accident
I was randomly put into choir and I
remember that day great detail I
remember being so so disappointed and no
idea being put into choir totally
changed my life because I mean I&#39;m sure
like especially with that intro like you
know like what choir I why would you
love that yeah I love it now singing
with people it&#39;s an amazing feeling
it really is because that&#39;s a core part
of who I am I love talking to people I
love being around people I love engaging
with people see but I was I was a really
different person in sixth grade yeah
that&#39;s just sixth grade and that was the
class that changed me and it changed the
direction of my life was it inspired me
inspired me to do music thanks to miss
Campbell was shout out to her yeah that
that class that class inspired me how is
that possible how can a teacher make
somebody who took every chance every
single chance say no I don&#39;t want to do
it no I don&#39;t want to do this how did
she get me to love music how did she get
me to walk to dedicate my life
honestly to this day I don&#39;t know let&#39;s
see there&#39;s only so much the inspiration
can do if you don&#39;t have the tools if
you don&#39;t have the tools to pursue what
inspiration is asking you to do
sometimes inspiration asks you to do a
lot can I have the tools in a way of
game now for the tools music theory yeah
anytime I mention music theory to any
student here they they just grow and you
know I stopped them said music theory is
a tool that&#39;s all it is it&#39;s just a tool
it&#39;s a tool to help you pursue music
some just don&#39;t want forcing music it&#39;s
not the same way that I do music theory
it made me think about the world in a
different way music theory help me help
me listen songs differently because in
that same time my brother my oldest
brother is getting me into production
it&#39;s basically making all music
everything that you hear a song in a
computer it&#39;s me that&#39;s just crazy how
can you make something that seems so
human inside a machine seems a little
bit contradictory I was getting into
protection around the age of 13 14 and
that&#39;s all I did I kind of put put down
my guitar for a little while and I
started producing I started making music
inside a computer and during that time I
started I started learning odd because I
think that&#39;s the most important thing
you can do if you like just a lark
that&#39;s all I say just learn and so I
started I started gaining the tools that
I needed to start producing my own work
I started getting the tools that I
needed to make full songs that can be
not only entertainment not only
beautiful but they conveys useful ideas
know a little a little bit more time
passed by and I started feeling a lot
because that&#39;s what I mean being a
teenager there&#39;s so much there&#39;s so many
for so many and dealing with those
firsts well everybody has their own way
about I I chose music because I know I
know that there there are other people
that are few
the same things that I&#39;m feeling there&#39;s
world teenagers will go through similar
things not exactly the same
yeah I&#39;ve been definitely about on that
but we&#39;re going through similar things
and being that I love people I always
want to help people in any way that I
can of course they don&#39;t want to
overstep but I want to help people and
music is one way of today because music
music is medicine music can bring people
together there&#39;s not feeling of being a
concert with all these people everybody
is there everybody is is in the moment
everybody&#39;s feeling every word every
sound it heals it brings together this
that&#39;s one of that&#39;s that&#39;s another
feeling that it&#39;s just out of this world
we experience every day sometimes we
choose to reject that guilt but you see
music to me music is emotion main will
agree with that music music music as a
tool
and how we choose to use these tools
they&#39;re all around us like music theory
like math that&#39;s what really counts and
inspiration inspiration pushes us to use
these tools it&#39;s important to think
about how we use these tools
now I encourage everybody in this room
to think about any time that you&#39;ve been
inspired they encourage you to chase
those inspirations because I chased an
inspiration and it changed my life it
pointed me in the right direction they
told me where to go it told me that you
have that you have this tool you&#39;re
given these tools and last you tell you
you&#39;re taught these things do something
the great words Picasso don&#39;t don&#39;t just
borrow I&#39;ll just borrow from other
artists steal it that&#39;s what great
artists do that&#39;s what I do kind of know
as I listen to all this music and I try
to take it in and then I try and create
something amazing but see you can&#39;t just
make something that&#39;s beautiful because
that&#39;s ephemeral emotions of ephemeral
if it inspires and ephemeral emotions
it&#39;s not gonna last very long they want
their work to span the ages it&#39;s the
fantasy and see the seed of permanence
is the idea when when you make an idea
beautiful and when you make it however
when you make it something that people
want to listen to something that people
can&#39;t get enough up that&#39;s when you
really make when art inspires change
when it inspires people when it changes
people that&#39;s real art to me that&#39;s
music
it&#39;s not only emotion it&#39;s change so
just change people change the world
thank you
