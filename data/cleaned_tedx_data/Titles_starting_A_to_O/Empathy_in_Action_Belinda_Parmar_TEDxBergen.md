most of us can expect 50 years of our
lives at work that&#39;s more time we spend
with our families yet the irony is only
one in 10 of us are engaged at work work
is failing for many to provide a sense
of belonging it&#39;s become a transaction a
paycheck a place devoid of empathy why
should we accept this I want to show you
another way I want to show you today how
more imperfect companies and more
possible how you can start to measure
empathy in your own organizations and
increased empathy through what I call
empathy nudges these small things that
will make a big difference to your
company and when you&#39;re talking about
empathy you&#39;ve really gotta focus on
that detail because no detail is too
small we need to look at every process
every image every word every algorithm
and when you walk out of here I would
love you to see your own workplace
through the world event through the lens
of everything but first I want to show
you how not to do it this image this guy
is a Twitter employee the way people
found out he&#39;d made reduc he was made of
Douglas he walked in one day and all of
a sudden he couldn&#39;t log on to his
Twitter account it&#39;s kind of like a
corporate equivalent of being done by
text this image this image was used by
one of the biggest American companies
and it was used to celebrate those staff
who had devoted 25 years of their lives
to be
but they couldn&#39;t be bothered by
kitchens of everyone books and just
imagine that you are a young aspiring
career woman and you&#39;re searching for
images on Google of CEOs you suppose to
a picture of a man and another man and
another man and the first female you see
is CEO Barbie so they&#39;d use it appears
to smash the glass ceiling we need it
waste of 18 inches and a ridiculous
wardrobe okay now I will be really clear
with my definition of empathy there&#39;s
individual empathy and this
organizational empathy and I want to
talk to you today about organizational
empathy that&#39;s hard to do with body of
the screen and in my experience in
business most business leaders are not
psychopaths you do meet the one or two
business leaders are empathic it&#39;s not
the people it&#39;s the sister the culture
the environment the policies even the
style of meetings that cause in plastic
people to behave in unimpacted ways my
definition of empathy is the emotional
impact that a company has on people so
customers and staff and society I am NOT
talking about emotion intelligent
they took have incredibly high awareness
of the issues but in Catholic
organizations they are accountable of
the issues and what I call empathy in
action I&#39;ve studied the most empathic
organizations in the world I&#39;ve asked
the question what makes them empathic
there are seven key drivers to empathy
and Powerman when you walk through your
office really walk into your building do
you really feel that you can make a
difference authenticity how different is
your home self from your work self or
can you bring the whole of yourself to
work and belonging the longing is at the
heart of a really an applic organization
belonging is do you feel part of
something does you always get hurt do
you actually feel that you matter and
the problem with the examples that I&#39;ve
shared with you is what they&#39;re
screaming is you don&#39;t belong here it&#39;s
not just the emotional benefits of more
empathic companies it&#39;s a financial
benefit more empathic companies make
more money they&#39;re more profitable in my
Adept the Federico mentioned the top ten
companies with one I&#39;m running index be
doing it for a few years but we measure
empathy in companies and we top 10
companies they outperform the bottom 10
by 50% more empathic companies they
deliver more value whatever way you cut
the numbers by growth by earnings by
productivity there is value there
technology for all its grand promises of
democratization it is actually few
lately heavy
dad said with the rise of machine
learning we are seeing empathy becomes
Gesser
and that&#39;s because the people who are
counting the technology they&#39;ve got
their own biases like I&#39;ve got my own
biases before they do is they just put
those biases into the datasets they
create what day to say that we were
program and more associated with work
man and guess what the word that was
most associated with women was homemaker
which you depart first introduced their
facial recognition software it didn&#39;t
recognize black faces because the people
who were testing it were reflected at
the Silicon Valley bias which is white
and Asian when Microsoft went Microsoft

first introduced today they&#39;re AI 2:18
chat bar
who was supposed to improve customer
service what happened with Terri was the
users starting to say with misogynistic
and racist remarks to take who they
started with going to taking them back
that was in 48 hours and the problem the
problem with this is that when the
technology industry has an empathy
bypass a single of biased individual in
have finite damage although Trump is
doing a good work for money but a biased
outlet that can reach videos I want
technology companies to become more
accountable for their algorithms and I
want them to stop putting empathy at the
heart of their organizations
so if technology is viewing the empathy
deficit who&#39;s driving the demand it&#39;s
you guys
it&#39;s Millennials it&#39;s the next
generation
I&#39;m currently interviewing residents at
company at the moment where the average
age is 25 and you guys are so different
at work
you will sacrifice money from email you
want emotional recognition you want the
text message that says you know what you
rocked it in that presentation you did
so our data shows that Millennials are
three times more like more comfortable
talking about their emotions at work
with their bosses I mean that&#39;s just
some things that I wasn&#39;t you know I
didn&#39;t feel comfortable enough doing
that when I was their age but it&#39;s so
needed in the workplace and if you think
about how many look how many jobs that a
millennial or digital native well have
over their working life its 22 holds 20
jobs you know compared to my generation
which you had only four so you guys are
much more flexible much less tethered
and you guys are saying we want empathy
my journey into this into FSA was I used
to be a campaigner I used to be a
campaign is getting more moving into
technology and a lot of the work we were
doing in internal culture was actually
benefiting there - because men want more
empathic our cultures
why wouldn&#39;t they and the problem the
problem when you talk about gender is
that a lot of men don&#39;t say anything
simply say the work thing and a little
bit women we were working with they
didn&#39;t want to be part of the female
early program diversity is weakness is
that it emphasizes the other so I say
this as a feminist that actually gender
can divide us but empathy unites us the
evidence is clear that diversity
that is not effective what if the
biggest technology companies in this
world spent 265 million dollars on its
diversity program it is not increased
number of African Americans in two years
it&#39;s increased the number of women in
technical positions for junk by just 1%
so my message to you today is digital
diversity programs and focus on empathy
but how do you do that and before you
can manage them thick you&#39;ve really got
to measure it and you&#39;ve got to measure
it with the right things so companies
who deceive themselves all the time
about their metrics now I know this
business because before I have myself so
gear I would like to myself that I drank
less coffee than I should have
I would lie to myself that but water
when trunk and understand how many steps
I&#39;ve taken in companies they would do
this all the time with their metrics
they will sit there and they&#39;ll sort out
their employment engagements cause there
any PS their customer satisfaction
scores and they would tell me how proud
the people in their organization are to
work for the company they ask the same
more questions in the same way and they
get the same old answers and staff tell
them what they want to hear do you feel
proud to work this company what I want
to talk about is the hidden metrics of
empathy because these are things that
you guys could start to measure its
things like blowing out these on email
BCC if your company has a high
proportion of line company enough it has
a culture of disempowerment
company politics we all know those
people who weave themselves a new
organisation to get the talk if you come
company has a hype map of people
spending a lot of time on come
politics they are pursuing their own
agenda not growing the company which is
what they should be doing another metric
is the percentage of time that senior
people in a company versus junior people
are speaking if you don&#39;t want your
senior people to be speaking all the
time you want your ideas from your
junior people because those are the
people you don&#39;t want to create a
culture of death roots which is counter
to a culture of innovation in everything
and it&#39;s these metrics that will really
give you a good understanding of what&#39;s
going on in your organization or
institution but where do you start
how do you actually start embedding
empathy this should not be a tick box
exercise how do you reach sustain it I&#39;m
going to talk to you about the power of
the nudge and I love nudges is taken
from behavioral science but there are
really small things that in aggregate
makes such a difference to your
organization doesn&#39;t matter how big or
how small and I&#39;ve been lucky enough to
be involved in the notice I&#39;m going to
share with you okay a bank a bank does
financial industry is not known for
itself and is it what they did is they
look to empathy and language and
language is one of the most important
tools that we have because it&#39;s how we
relate to each other and they change the
were they like that those are the 50
deficit between the head office and the
front lines of the branches and they
identified that this was fueling a sense
of inequality the word head is mean
superior so they changed the name of the
head office to support hub that
reinforced that the fact that their head
office was there to serve the people in
the branches front line third line is
infinity term it means first my defense
to who&#39;s the enemy they changed that to
front of house this is just a
example there was 42 different nudges
they&#39;ve created an empty subunit in the
heart of the bag and they have 3,000
empathy ambassadors they are really
trying to put they are trying to put
empathy as part of the soul of the
organization I think meeting people
spent time in boring meetings while a
food company what they did was they
correlated there are no empathy levels
to the meeting culture and you can
really tell a lot from a meeting in a
company is to have as their empathy
levels and what they did was they found
out of their time a lot of people with
the organization was spending all their
time in meetings death by PowerPoint
misogyny goes and in learning company
politics was going on there so what they
did was a really simple nudge is they
put in at our meetings 15 minutes down
that meetings with a structure to gather
chairs it really made a difference to
the way that meetings will align people
have more time to prepare and ultimately
there was a lot less time as masajid
goes which has to be a good thing hey
this is an example for a advertising
agency and they had really no I empathy
levels but actually what they were doing
is they were giving you a lot of perks
to their people and they want
contextualizes those perks what they
really needs to do was they needed to
reinforce the empathy that the company
was sharing to the people in the
organization another example in a school
it doesn&#39;t just have to be business
where these empathy nudges can be
incredibly powerful this is where school
and this was just before accounting a
robotics lesson and girls we know can be
apprehensive about technology because
it&#39;s still very month still very
gendered well they did it its thing for
an inspirational quote from inspiration
the woman that gave girls permission to
succeed just as they were about to do a
technology letter another thing they did
is they rearranged the chairs so they
went from this grid like structure
we ask that back to the wall to this
much more collaborative learning space
and that encourage peer-to-peer Lee
Utley learning and pair programming and
they saw an increase of GCSE computer
science my last example is riddle to
motive company and what they did is they
identified that the embassy deficit
wasn&#39;t in the sales approach but it was
in the environment right down to the
signage to the way we were greeted when
you walked into the car dealership
through to the tie this is Paul the
Tiger thought was wearing and this high
actually symbolized that the pushy sales
approach so they changed the time it
changed the uniform they changed the
environment and with all these nuts
bases all sales go up by 23% now these
things are not difficult they&#39;re really
not I want us to create more work places
like this where empathy is at the heart
of the organizations where technology
giving horses of humanity where empathy
is measured and managed and when we
start to care about these really really
tiny things because they dictate who
belongs in a space empathy has the power
to transform a workplace and never have
we needed it more than we need it today
thank you very much
