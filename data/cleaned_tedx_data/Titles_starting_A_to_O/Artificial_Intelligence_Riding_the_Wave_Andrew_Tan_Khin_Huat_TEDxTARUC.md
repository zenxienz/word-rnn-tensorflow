good morning to clarify I want to say
that I wouldn&#39;t be speaking under one
dose of artificial intelligence but
before we go there let&#39;s just start by
Framing my thoughts where do I come from
now just a couple of weeks ago I was
depending that pop in this campus like
that some people over and in the closing
of the top this guest because say this
thing that really blew my mind he
addressed the young crowd of students
wish to be back see you see Millennials
people say if Turnbull would ethics and
you guys are spoiled and you don&#39;t know
what it means to be in the workforce and
Millennials be the change you are you&#39;re
not right for society and in hell this
young people forget about what they say
or care about what they say because
whether we like it or not you are the
future and society will have to conform
you not you to us and I really blew my
mind because as an educator I spend most
of my time trying to teach my students
how to be ready for me don&#39;t like and
all the what I&#39;ve been trying to conform
my students to today&#39;s society but I&#39;ve
never thought that my students will be
the Society and I shouldn&#39;t get them to
conform rather we should be thinking how
we can leverage on the transformation of
society brought about by the coming
generations so today that will be the
focus of my talk I will be talking about
artificial intelligence riding the wave
that&#39;s my title artificial intelligence
riding the wave and in this particular
talk I will not be discussing too much
of technical issues but I will be
speaking on how artificial intelligence
will bring about transformation to
society and if you want to capitalize on
this track
there are three very simple thought
processes about presenting number one
you need to know your target audience
which is not you it&#39;s not your parents
it is the coming generation
what will the coming generation one
number two you need to understand
technology because technology will be
the driving force in changing society in
the next decade or so
and number three you want to be
successful you then need to make some
predictions and some bets treaty but
look at what are the possible
transformations that will arise so we
start by looking at our because I don&#39;t
know what the future generation would be
like my first point of reference would
be to look at the Millennial Generation
people born between the 1980s - mm I
fought this particular category and
research - research common sex they say
that the Millennials and people who are
very digital digital natives Millennials
are people who are very well connected
socially technologically I think these
are very mechanistic media of course we
all know that Millennials and people who
have less spending power than the
previous generation of this may be a bit
strange
come millenials are people who are
encumbered by death recession student
loans and the letters are people with
very very different priorities from the
previous generation when you look at the
combination of the first effectors this
drives the different priorities I no
longer seek for example I would be for
myself but if I were a meal and feminist
generalize I am no longer sick material
security but rather I prefer to see
experiences why because the connected
world has opened up my mind to see that
the world is so much bigger
then my backyard there is so much more I
can do the the connected world has
showed me that life is not just about
building up my little Empire but life is
for contributing to society
and that&#39;s why elegance the way with
anything little bit different right and
we then ask ourselves if Millennials
think like this what about the next
generation what characteristics of the
Millennials will carry on to the next
generation
which we call the generation sea will
they be just as connected as us or even
more connected will they be just as
socializes willing to share caring about
society or will there be a dramatic
shift perhaps an outbreak of World War
II completely transforming society now
there&#39;s a lot we do not know but if you
were to think positively we can assume
some things technology will continue to
grow people will continue to be more and
more connected they marry part of their
lives and this will change the future
generation to be people who are even
more than to share even more willing to
be contribution to society
it also changed their demands their
priorities I know not good me to possess
vast amounts of material rather I can
learn to collaborate with people and
there will be the future generation the
question is can you produce a product or
a service that enables the next
generation generations the one so the
first point your target audience do you
know your target audience my second
point is technology do you understand
the technology that will transform
society in the next decade and that is
artificial intelligence
companies like Google Microsoft have
boldly proclaimed today that there are
companies focused
ái first which means all the resources
that I make they will allocate as much
as they can to artificial intelligence
before they do anything else and this is
coming from a company like Microsoft
whose moneymakers has always been an
operating system or Microsoft Office
they&#39;ve decided these things are no
longer our priority artificial
intelligence first number one of why to
help you to understand on the bring the
power of AI down to the münster we
compare artificial intelligence to us
humans and the first thing we recognize
is a eyes had vastly superior perception
capabilities what I can see is limited
to the human spectrum when an AI can see
is beyond what I can hear it is limited
to sonic frequencies I kept at it 10,000
but it&#39;s for example an artificially
intelligent program that this is the
subsonic ultrasonic frequency the sonic
frequencies and identify happiness that
we cannot see more than them and
efficient intelligence today has access
to practically unlimited processing
power and unlimited memory now this
comes for two reasons number one
technology processes either in faster
memory is getting cheaper but the
transformative technology is second one
broadband mobile internet today you
don&#39;t need to create a super powerful
machine that you can carry around
because every little device you keep in
your pocket as excess the supercomputer
cloud performance through the internet
when you use a program like Stevie and
you ask it to you dictate something they
ask you to put something that works
this program is then sending telemetry
over to the service processing on your
speaking converting a little text
understanding what you&#39;re saying and
putting down your next calendar entry
for you and this is only done because of
the power of the Internet
this will continue to grow we also know
that artificial intelligence today
besides being completely connected by
the internet business being unlimited in
processing power memory then AI today is
relentless
- it can go on and on it does not need
to rest it does not need to eat you can
take an hour to read a book and a I can
win the million books at the same time
he has got no problem is that and that&#39;s
why I will be the better transformative
technology and if you understand the
technology you will then begin to
understand the changes you can bring to
society and when you understand the
changes you&#39;ve a bring to society that&#39;s
where we can explore some of the
transformations and today&#39;s theme is the
multiverse it is impossible for me to
predict everything and anything the
artificial intelligence will bring but I
will explore only three possibilities
and I hope with these three
possibilities we will open up your mind
to anything how will society change and
be transformed by artificial
intelligence the first thing I will
explore is this concept of universal
basic income how many of you have heard
of this concept one to a handful right
the concept of universal basic income is
really simple everyone in the country
whether you deserve it or you don&#39;t
deserve it
everyone whether you&#39;re a resident or a
citizen will receive an unconditional
fixed amount of salary unconditional are
you working okay are you not working you
get it are you sick you still get it
they help me in your ability you still
get this unconditional salary it&#39;s not a
new idea but today the idea of universal
basic income is suddenly
very relevant people I much like about
from Facebook people like Elon Musk from
Tesla are championing this idea
countries like Switzerland have actually
brought in a referendum to vote whether
we should have universal basic income
the why is this so important because
artificial intelligence is poised to
take the jobs of the people you may not
realize it but up to 80% of blue-collar
jobs will be replaced by a knight and
you may think the white collar fellas
are we are saying no why would I get an
accountant or an auditor if I can get AI
program to do it all for me why would I
need an optician with an artificial
intelligence program on my phone can
scan my eyes and tell me exactly what
diopter on you why would I need them and
if you really think about it many many
industries will be affected by
artificial intelligence and these people
who are discussing you behind on
universal basic income say that this
will bring about a huge wide gap of
wealth that needs to be a way to solve
this problem now money question use this
if this does become a solution universal
basic income so you imagine now everyone
in the coming generation gets a fixed
salary whether they like it or not
whether they want be me everybody gets a
fixer the question is what will the next
generation do with this money so I did
the products but when I asked some of my
friends what would you do if you got a
fixed income
four thousand ringgit not too high too
low four thousand a month you don&#39;t have
to move anything you get this oh you do
some people tell me I would be a water
sports enthusiasts some people tell me I
will be a soup kitchen operator
some people tell me I will continue the
work because I drop my event I want to
the stop process and Amina has these
questions the thing that I really wonder
is what will the next generation do with
this money because many people say when
you give a free salary to everybody
people will be lazy
you wouldn&#39;t want to save on watch TV
but that may not be true giving you that
fixed salary gives you the Liberty to go
into business to be an entrepreneur you
don&#39;t have to worry because there&#39;s
always that fallback and what new
businesses will arise I think that&#39;s a
very important question
furthermore people will be willing to
share we look at the future generation
just of the private audience they may be
more willing to share they may be more
willing to contribute to society what
will they do with the money that is
something for you think about and if you
can think identify a particular niche a
particular market that you can meet you
would have a really thought of a
business that you can run in the 23rd
century sorry the next transformation I
will bring about or I will discuss an
artificial intelligence may bring about
is the idea of the green imagination of
space now to break this down to
something that&#39;s very easy to understand
we look at the hottest view of ära
autonomous vehicles self-driving cars
now self-driving cars sound like a
really nice convenience my car can&#39;t
drive on its own is great but I wonder
if you really really consider the RAM
vacations of self-driving cars number
one if your car can&#39;t drive by itself
why do you need a parking lot number two
if your car can&#39;t drive by itself why do
you need a car you don&#39;t need a car
anymore why we change the material
object when you can just use it as a
service today the closest service we
have is you believe you need a car
continue for exactly when it tells you
the color right take it the destination
drop you off but it still requires the
human driver therefore the cost is still
high but when the car is fully
autonomous traffic problems are solved
your car can arrive faster leave faster
go to the next passenger faster you
don&#39;t need drivers it will be cheaper it
totally doesn&#39;t make sense to own a car
now how will this transform space powers
of offices today and floors and floors
of parking lots what would they be
useful all the proper parking laws we
have in KL chalk in available
what will it be useful and not only that
the road stem cell will we still need on
a multi-lane highways when people are
sharing the vehicles and not only
sharing but because the vehicles are
controlled by AI there is no congestion
which means the roads were clear faster
what we use are we doing on the space
and we go further today we drive above
the soil on the surface of the road
because as a driver we need light we
want to see the artificial intelligence
it may make even more sense to just go
underground and that&#39;s what a lot mass
is doing today why do you need cars on
the ball pop them somewhere safe
contain very has no chance to hit any
pedestrians then the question becomes
what happens to all the ruins
when I first own this space and in the
beginning I mentioned that we want to
talk about AI today and riding the wave
so if you can think of something that
you can do with that space and today I&#39;m
just talking about cars and I will
transform a lot more space I&#39;m just
talking about cars roads and parking
lots there will be a transformation of
space I look at the condo I stay four
floors of parking
I can&#39;t build houses there I kind of
convert into a factory
what will that condos parking lot be and
20 years in the future when they are no
cars dead what will happen and if you
can think of an application you will
have a business for the 21st century we
mix now the last point or two minutes
left the last point I wanna touch on is
the paradigm shift in the idea of
consumerism and material possessions
right today the sharing economy is
growing sharing of cars sharing of rooms
and houses Airbnb you will but in the
future we foresee that the sharing
economy will share even more things
let&#39;s imagine companies like Amazon now
are working on delivery drones drones
they can get you a product from a
central hive in the city to your house
in 15 minutes on this now my question is
this if a product can imagine my
doorstep in 15 minutes or less why do I
need to own that product let&#39;s take for
example last week I drilled two holes in
the wall to mount a clothes hanger I&#39;ve
never used my drill before
for two years I have a drill my house
I&#39;ve never used it and then last week I
use it for 15 minutes
it&#39;s completely silly for us to possess
own a device like a power drill in the
house it&#39;s completely silly to own your
own giant barbeque grill if you only use
it once or twice a year and what other
products today that people regularly buy
it on next a pros I&#39;m taught the most
fancy beautiful and bang you&#39;re seen for
the girls how often do you use it now I
can create a service that allows you to
rent out the products that you have you
put up your hand back and say oh this is
my handbag you can rent it for fifteen
dollars an hour if someone is interested
they punch it in
I won this headband this day this time a
drone goes price to yoga picks it up
flies it about in a person&#39;s place they
take it or didn&#39;t bring it back to send
it back to your house how is this going
to transform ecommerce when people no
longer placed a premium on ownership I
don&#39;t mean to only I just want to
experience it I just want to use it and
then mentioned us now in the coming
generation we foresee a change in
priorities no longer when I want to open
my own car it doesn&#39;t make sense anymore
now this may be fighting this idea no no
I need my own car I want to go where I
wanna go whenever we&#39;ll go forget about
it because society will change because
of occupations now man hands up I hope
today I open up your mind to really
think imagine I wonder what are the
possibilities in the multiverse for the
power a traditionalist thank you
[Applause]
