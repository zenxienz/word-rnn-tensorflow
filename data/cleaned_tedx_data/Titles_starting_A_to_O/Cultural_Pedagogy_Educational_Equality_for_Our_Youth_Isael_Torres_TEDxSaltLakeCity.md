it&#39;s not always easy for me to describe
to my peers how the world of my home and
the world of my school often felt
galaxies apart but the way that my mom
would demand I not forget about no siree
Hollis and how my teacher would assign
my homework were two very different
experiences or how my dad expected me to
individually greet each and every one of
my dias and D s with a handshake a hug
and a kiss something that I would not do
when I would step into my classrooms I
share this to try and center the purpose
and importance of an idea known as
culturally relevant pedagogy or
culturally relevant teaching an idea
that it might start but goes well beyond
our schools and classrooms it&#39;s an
attempt to create effective and
sustainable social political and
economical spaces and practices to serve
our communities equitably all in the
hope of evolving our school systems to
better meet the needs of our students
rather than expecting our students to
continuously be meeting the needs and
standards of our traditional school
systems Gloria ladson-billings
identified and defined culturally
relevant pedagogy as a praxis that uses
student culture to transcend the
negative effects of the dominant culture
the negative effects are brought about
for example by not seeing one&#39;s history
culture or background represented in the
textbooks or curriculum entonces cuando
trata yoda records our explicar looking
for a me experiencia and that of many
other students that I feel I can relate
with I can tell you that there were few
if any moments in any given school year
where I was ever addressed in Spanish or
any other language for that matter now
aside from the fact that maybe my
instructors were unable to speak other
languages or were somewhat too fully
familiar with other cultures and customs
for me the point is that they were not
going to try and do so in a sense I fell
into a conditioned expectation that my
education depended on me conforming to a
traditional system of schooling
rather than expecting that my education
conformed or evolved to meet my needs or
the needs of other students who may not
fit the traditional definition of a
successful student what have we been
taught to understand embodies or
increases the chances of a successful
student a child that leaves and comes
home to a two-parent household who
leaves and comes home to an actual home
in a neighborhood who eats breakfast and
dinner every day who isn&#39;t tasked with
having to translate for their parents at
parent-teacher conferences who doesn&#39;t
hide in their shame of not understanding
by either withdrawing or acting out in
their classrooms what about us then who
may not fit into each and every one of
these categories should our potential
differences demas any less worthy of
success culturally relevant teaching
seeks to not simply recognize but to
acknowledge these differences to better
improve a student&#39;s academic experience
and ambitions for those of us who are
students teachers parents school
administrators a person with some basic
sense of awareness we&#39;re fully aware
that this is simply not always the case
and yet we teach as if it were we have
fine tuned a machine to mass-produce
education currently in Utah our K
through 12 student population sits at
about six hundred and fifty-four
thousand students of the 50 million that
exist across our entire us country we
compared this to a dwindling population
of educated licensed and trained
instructors and it makes sense our
system gets down to a desperate task of
meeting our limited supply with an
overwhelming demand but at what cost and
who pays what I would offer is that
right now just as we&#39;ve been seeing for
decades the cost of these ill maintained
systems of education our missed
opportunities for our overlooked and
underserved students and communities
that in some cases are paid with a
person&#39;s life specifically the life of
someone who is not white male and/or of
a privileged background
how does this happen how do we end up in
devastating situations of having seven
shots fired at someone as they sit in
their vehicle along with their partner
and child watching as this all happens
as we were all forced to witness in the
case of falando Casteel and countless
other senseless tragedies that have been
occurring recently and have been
occurring over the history of our
country what does this have to do with
our schools let&#39;s look at how our
schools classrooms and textbooks are set
up we expect our students to begin
building a world made of history science
math literature our technology concepts
we&#39;re all familiar with all in the hope
of helping and helping them make sense
of what it all means
year after year if your student like me
you start to put together a pattern
where you notice that most if not all
power and knowledge has been created and
distributed by white male heroes the
writing on the wall then might spell out
that my life my ambitions they may not
mean as much Christopher Columbus
credited with discovering or conquering
the Americas European pilgrims in search
of religious freedom settled Jamestown
shortly after William Bradford hosts our
first Thanksgiving George Washington the
first of 43 consecutively white male
presidents and our founding fathers
bring about America the great the
original great to avoid any confusion
going in our current times Eli Whitney
Andrew Jackson Abraham Lincoln John F
Kennedy Neil Armstrong Martin Luther
King Harvey Milk
Brigham Young President Obama President
Trump the simple list of figures that
I&#39;m confident most of us have been made
fully aware of gets recycled and
packaged as a one size fits all set of
facts by omission minimizing or
silencing the voices of many who
contributed or in many cases led this
list of figures to be credited for
defining the milestones of our American
Society
where is the story of our women of our
communities of color of our LGBTQ
community what does this narrative build
or divide if students like myself are
not reflected in this country&#39;s history
in our classrooms and consequently in
our general mainstream culture then how
does society expect us to be present and
contribute to our future representation

adido
let me repeat this concept of cultural
relevancy requires us to explore causes
as opposed to simply analyzing outcomes
so before we begin to challenge the
dominant deficit system that surrounds
our current educational practices our
society must first acknowledge and be
upfront about how oppressed communities
were not even welcomed into our schools
until 100 years after this country was
founded and even when our history
classes try and convince us that
concepts of slavery and racism ended
upon emancipation we fail to fully
explain the extent to which our
communities were forced to assimilate or
face consequences of death were worse at
times we were blatantly asked to forgo
our history and culture as I would argue
is highly evidenced in my home state of
Utah when we speak of our Native
American communities if you&#39;re willing
to look into the hallways of our school
administration our government
institutions you&#39;ll see that a dominant
race and culture are overwhelmingly
present to make sense of a potential and
almost certain bias and it&#39;s in this
bias where we see the origins of systems
such as the school to Prison Pipeline
where it&#39;s possible for a collective of
17 percent of Native American black and
latin x student populations to be held
accountable for over 33% of all school
disciplinary actions it&#39;s this mentality
that leads us to justify the fact that
we invest more in our prisons than we do
in our schools just take a look around
this audience the venue they were in and
know that spaces like these do not look
or work the way they do by some miracle
incidents we as a society are all
victims of our social and educational
constructs
which I challenge includes the dominant
mainstream culture upon which many of
these practices are founded on I was not
taught who said Chavez or Dolores Huerta
were among other great historic icons or
what their place in history is until I
was a senior in college and even then I
learned through a great friend of mine
not in a classroom I was infuriated
feeling like it had been hidden from me
to think how much of an impact it could
have had on me to know that Latin ex
figures did so much to influence civil
in worker rights a field of work and
legacy that I am honored to be a part of
now myself with the students communities
and schools that I serve every day while
I and other students are asking for is
not hard it simply requires
acknowledgement a dedication to justice
accountability and a willingness to
endure discomfort because for someone
like myself to stand and say and speak
to concepts of racial and cultural
disparity puts me at risk of being
critiqued of losing friends partners
even losing a job but the cost of not
speaking the cost of silence in our
education and in other spaces is higher
because as we keep seeing we run the
risk of someone potentially being harmed
or potentially losing their life I will
end by sharing some words that my
parents would say to me time and time
again as I would leave the house that I
grew up in to go and try and accomplish
something bigger than myself
