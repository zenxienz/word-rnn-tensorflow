I&#39;m guessing most of your wandering out
too tall I must be well you are not
alone not a single day in my life goes
without was being asked how tall are you
well these are not very Heights where I
come from I was born in Sudan
I grew up hiding my father&#39;s cows along
the plain of ribbon island berg√ºzar
until my academic journey began it was
my only life and my only wall how lucky
I feel my personal experiences all right
transition from looking for paths and
water for my father&#39;s cows to being a
Harvard student and I&#39;m so passionate
about our collective effort to make
education available for sausage and his
kids for 21 years
civil war went on in Sudan as citizen
exp and the consequences directly or
indirectly directly for those who lost
their homes and families in some regions
only kids survived recount the losses
for those of us who were lucky there was
no access to basic education health care
and many other services that the
government should provide but I was too
young then to comprehend this mess
around me so how did I get out of Sudan
and why in general 2005 a cousin of mine
arrived from Kappa refugee calm yet when
asked by my brothers to bring me to the
calm so that could also go to school
just like them I remember that afternoon
I was away from home playing with my
friends when I came home that evening I
had no clothes no shoes I was so shy to
meet the visitor but that was normal in
my wall my parent was so delighted the
broken news to me that I would be
leaving home to meet my brothers we&#39;d
left home in 1999 and 2003 for camera
Finnick on the Left home so that you
could also go to school it became my
immediate motivation
I was happy to leave one step closer
meet my brothers we have been away for
some time the last night before my epic
journey begun relatives and neighbors
came to wish me well speeches were made
my father said the last prayer he
touched my shoulder and speed in a jug
of water and pour it on my feet as a
sign of blessing then he said go out
there and decide your destiny those who
I didn&#39;t mean much to me then by today
that the driving force behind my
academic journey we left the following
morning passing through other villages
to pick up more kids my cousin was half
to bring the camera Vinnie come you must
be wondering why were being picked up to
be delivered the stable of refugees well
leaving Sudan was our only or the best
option of us ever going to school so I
left home and we arrived in Kakuma in
dream after 3 months and I went to
school for the first time I was 9 years
old
training 10 what were you doing when you
were 9 years old I was so disappointed
when I landed my brothers were not in
the come to another item with me that
means it&#39;s a turn was failure by the
UNHCR hi there for dinner preciate that
the life in the cup Madhavi come at all
it was too hard too dusty too dirty and
overcrowded at the same time often
wondered why there was so many people
around me until my cousin explained to
me that we were refugees and what it
meant being a refugee people can often
to feel sorry for me once I landed I was
wanted FEG
because I know what it meant being a
refugee especially in the current wall
order being a refugee tend to rob you of
your dignity as others see you a lot
read one of my school met once asked me
if my father had a gun and how many
people I had personally killed I didn&#39;t
know what to tell him I had just become
another victim of 0 times the crewel
narrative that refugees are fighters and
potential
often with escape this misconception by
interacting with my fellow students and
letting them know barrier me meanwhile
incident five the leaders of the rebel
movement and the central government
based in Khartoum settled their
differences and we experienced relative
peace for the first time in a long time
in Sudan
therefore Sudanese refugees in the calm
while voluntary moving back to their
villages or being encouraged to do so by
the UNHCR this generated a concern in
the camp that the UN might close down
schools for children and my brothers
knew if I were to go back to my village
I would no longer go to school but
fortunately a few of my cousin my cousin
live in Nairobi in aerobic the capital
city of Kenya and therefore moved on or
some of the other and 5007 and I was
enrolled in a boarding school where
again I faced a new set of challenges
but nonetheless I get in that schooling
in 2011 with the 4th highest grade in
the whole country and the Kenya
certificate of primary education exams
it was an amazing news it change the
trajectory of my academic journey it on
me a place in the top school for boys
ladies and gentlemen there&#39;s no word for
the opposite of loneliness
if the Wow I would say that&#39;s exactly
what I missed after being away from
family for 11 years I left the comfort
of family love 12 years ago inside of
knowledge I faced all odds an obstacle
on the way but that life has had a way
of growing me up testing my dedication
and resilience to reach my goal more
often than not I rise and embrace
challenges often tell myself no matter
what goes wrong they did not affect
school if there are kids out there our
day I would don&#39;t believe in themselves
let them know potential is inborn and
universal only opportunities our
resources are limited
we can turn our disadvantages into
advantages indeed it&#39;s been a long young
as young people in this world there are
a lot of things around our necks
what impaired our Herefords in achieving
our goal
it could be poverty or senseless civil
wars in the case of South Sudan the need
of education for young people in this
world is real for example in South Sudan
the other literacy rate is a mere 27
percent and 70% of children aged 6 to 17
years I&#39;ve never set foot in a classroom
and the completion rate from primary
school level to high school is less than
10% and only 13% of all the school in
the Republic can afford to provide a
full cycle of primary school from grade
1 to grade age gender equality is
another concern only 33 percent of girls
are in school with the transition rate
being less than 10% does mean 3 only 3.3
percent of God a past high school level
or Primus flavor for that much did the
math my generation is in in South Sudan
in my language the word for perception
is near we loosely translates to being
aware of this is what education does to
our people give her the new perception
on a wider scale what Harvard and my
instruction of the rest of the wall has
given me the ability to see things in
different lights education is important
for oneself for family for community and
the country therefore we need to make it
available for children to make it to
make it possible for children to go to
school my parent wanted me in school and
they conspired by sending me to a
refugee camp my brothers wanted me to
continue with education under conspired
by sending me to
boarding school I wanted to go to the
top school for boys in the country I
work hard and many people conspire to
make it possible as I continue with my
education I realized there are bigger
goals out there I wanted to go to
Harvard University and many people
conspired to make it possible indeed
there are a lot of things that we have
to assemble to succeed and not everyone
is able to do so I went back to my
village after being away for 11 years I
was so happy to meet my parents
but it disappointed at the same time my
eight mates are not going to school the
younger people are not going to school
we need we can change the narrative of
south sudan by educating its young
people making education available
especially in the villages to give an
incentive to parents and everyone else
to work hard and send children to school
my mother used to tell me how she always
wanted to go to school but her dreams
and aspirations were arrested by the
consequences of civil wars he therefore
made sure my brother and I wouldn&#39;t
follow the same path created by the past
about a lot generation in Sudan I am
currently working on a project with a
couple of friends planning to go back to
my village this summer to build a few
classes for the local school so that
kids wouldn&#39;t have to go to refugee
camps for basic education it&#39;s an
ambitious goal in which I seek our
collective effort that&#39;s my personal
legend an ambitious goal would I believe
when you purchase passionately want
something the universe conspires to have
you achieve it my successful academic
life thus far is as a result of
collective consideration conspiracies
let&#39;s conspire and make education
available for kids in South Sudan thank
you so much and I am only sick for
[Applause]
