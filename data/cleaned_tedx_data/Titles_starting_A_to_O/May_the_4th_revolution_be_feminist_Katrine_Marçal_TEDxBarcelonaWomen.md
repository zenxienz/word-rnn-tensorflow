you
the future is female that is a slogan we
hear a lot nowadays you supermodels wear
it on t-shirts Hillary Clinton used it
in her campaign the one she lost to
Donald Trump Trump Trump Trump haha you
can buy mugs saying the future is female
phone cases keyrings
the internet is basically full of this
kind of stuff but what does it mean the
future is female is it a promise and
aspiration or maybe a threat what I&#39;m
going to talk to you about today is what
if it&#39;s not a slogan the future is
female what if it&#39;s the truth a simple
statement of fact and what if this truth
is brought to you not by feminists or
activists or even by Beyonce but by
robots in the late 1990s the German car
manufacturer BMW was flooded with calls
it was flooded with angry calls angry
calls from angry German men and it was
all regarding the new voice navigation
system in the BMW 5-series
because BMW had given the voice
navigation system a female voice at the
roundabout take the third exit turn left
on the high street she said and this
infuriated some German men because they
would not take directions from a woman
and this is what they said and in some
instances shouted on the phone to BMW so
things have certainly
change sins and not just our view of
women and women giving directions but
our whole approach to these type of
intelligent machines of which the voice
navigation system was an example today
we don&#39;t pick up the phone
to customer service and complain about
them we are too busy being a scared of
these machines taking our jobs will you
be replaced by a robot we can read
newspaper articles about this almost
every week and they go on listing all
the professions that are under threat
taxi drivers surgeons bankers lawyers
etc etc anything you can do we read soon
there will be a robot that can do it
better and that robot is after your job
now I&#39;m a journalist and I am well aware
that they&#39;re already robots writing
newspaper articles and last year as a
matter of fact Japanese artificial
intelligence system co-authored a short
form novel and that novel was actually
passed the first screening for a
national literary award so yes the
robots are coming and it&#39;s not well it&#39;s
new in some sense but we have been
through this all before we call this
process that we&#39;re going through with
sort of robotics and artificial
intelligence developing and changing the
economy which is happening right now we
call it the fourth Industrial Revolution
which kind of implies that there&#39;s been
a first a second and a third Industrial
Revolution before and there has and
maybe they were not on the same scale
maybe not they were not of the exact
same kind but they were industrial
revolutions so in the 17 and 1800&#39;s we
developed machines that were physically
superior to humans in the sense that
they could lift more work faster and hit
harder in the factories and they entered
the factories and they destroyed lots of
jobs and they created lots of social
tension and what they really did with
the labor market is that they made human
physical strength less important on the
labor market and this eventually after
all this social tension freed many
humans up from the physical labor to
instead focus on the work of the mind
and we got what we call the knowledge
economy what human beings contribute
with in this knowledge economy is our
knowledge not our physical strength I
think therefore I am employed right so
what happens if artificial intelligence
gets better at thinking than us and this
is of course what we are very very
afraid of at the moment if the machines
get better with knowledge if they can
store more knowledge which they can and
process more knowledge which they can
and they will just improve what will be
left for us to do what will be to speak
economics for a while our competitive
advantage so I would suggest a few
things care relationships and empathy
all of this is tremendously important
for any economy and all of this requires
at least on some level humaneness there
is a form of consensus emerging that the
sectors of the economy that will be
relatively protected from automations
and the robots coming our sectors and
jobs and professions that require what
we would call a human touch so we&#39;re
talking about things like jobs in
nursing in elderly care early childhood
education Social Work and psychiatry and
the skills that where human beings will
have a competitive advantage against the
robots are the skills needed to do these
professions well so relationship
building empathy relationship
maintaining
etc etc now it&#39;s interesting from a
feminist point of view is of course that
these sectors of the economy that are
said to be relatively safe to automation
our sectors of the economy very much
dominated by women and the skills
required to do these type of jobs well
are the same skills that we have been
taught to view as female skills that
have probably not been thought about
that much as sort of central to the
economy things that we have largely
taken for granted and if you look at the
care sector in almost any economy in the
world you will find women working there
in many cases women of ethnic minorities
for very little pay often below minimum
wage so what happens if this very very
undervalued sector of the economy and
these very very undervalued skills
suddenly become so the part of the
economy kind of protected from the
robots will it make us value it more
will the care sector move from the
margins of the economy to the center of
the economy
well the skills required to do these
type of jobs well move from the margin
to the center in the same way and will
the future in this sense be female well
some people would say well you know the
machines will learn to do care work as
well and maybe they will there are
certain aspects of care work that lends
itself very well to automation and in
Japan they have already developed
machines that can lift a patient from
the wheelchair and put them on their bed
and Toyota are developing robots that
can help with housework or follow
nursing assistants around helping with
different things but I think most of us
would agree that there is something
about these professions that at least if
you are going to do them well requires
human empathy and human connection and
there&#39;s also this paradox in within
robotics that basically says that
whatever we as human beings find
difficult or hard to learn
it&#39;s like advanced chess or advanced
mathematics that is quite easy for
computers to learn and Excel it but
stuff that comes natural to us like
walking or catching a ball or hopscotch
you know they&#39;re even harder in these
type of shoes machines find really hard
but is really really hard to program
and in some sense maybe it doesn&#39;t
matter that computers can quite easily
nowadays beat the world champion in
chess because there&#39;s not a single robot
out there that is able to come into
another person&#39;s home and make that
person a cup of tea that is too hard and
there&#39;s not a single robot that&#39;s able
to follow your average toddler around a
playground and keeping this toddlers
safe on swings and climbing frames and
and etc that&#39;s too hard to program to
because all of that knowledge that type
of knowledge is stuff we humans learn
through our bodies interacting with our
environment which of course is difficult
for machines and so what will change
with this there is another thing that I
find quite interesting about all of this
about the body and that&#39;s of course that
women we&#39;ve been expected to do the work
that men don&#39;t want to do and a lot of
this work in the economy is work around
the body you know the bearing and racing
of children of course but also looking
after bodies the old the sick the young
looking after men&#39;s bodies so men are
freed up to do the work of the mind and
the better women in the economy have
been
doing this type of work the more
invisible it has become will the robots
change this well there is a chance
because most of the skills that women
have been expected to excel at or at
least do without complaining in the
economy are the exact same things that
artificial intelligence really struggles
with so imagine a future where robots
and artificial intelligence comes into
sector of the sector of the economy and
destroys jobs and men who have lost
their jobs to artificial intelligence
will have to move into jobs in nursing
childcare and elderly care because
that&#39;s where the demand for humans in
the economy will be now that type of
transition will be in many ways harder
than in previous in industrial
revolutions where we had to move people
from the countryside when jobs were lost
in agriculture into the factories in the
cities because to move unemployed men
into those type of sectors actually
requires not sure sort of you know it&#39;s
not just a question of economics and
public policy but also about sort of
changing what masculinity is and how we
value care work in the economy but
there&#39;s a big discussion at the moment
about you know the need for more
economic redistribution because of the
robots so taxing the robots and maybe
creating something like a universal
basic income for people who&#39;ve lost the
jobs but I think just as important as
sort of this discussion about taxing the
very board saw the openness of the robot
or whoever we&#39;re gonna tax it&#39;s a
discussion what do we do with the money
that we raise in this way and to spend
this money into creating good jobs in
the care sector whether human beings
will actually keep on probably at least
for the foreseeable future to have a
competitive advantage over the robots
and where there will be big demand
because of our aging societies that
would make a lot of sense also it would
and be a bad Society we would be
creating it would kind of be like
changing the knowledge economy for the
empathy economy or maybe the
relationship economy and in this sense
the machines could actually help us
become more humans that is if we let
them now there are lot of people lots of
very intelligent people that say that no
this won&#39;t happen artificial
intelligence is nothing that will help
us it&#39;s an art it&#39;s an fundamental
threat to humanity and soon there won&#39;t
be anything left that the robot that we
can do better than the robots so let&#39;s
just assume that these people aren&#39;t
wrong I&#39;m not saying there are I don&#39;t
know I can&#39;t look into the future but
let&#39;s for a moment assume that they are
wrong are they wrong because they are
overestimating the robots or are they
wrong because they are under estimating
their own humanity and to be more
specific that they are under estimating
the parts of their own humanity that we
have for centuries branded as female and
therefore deemed as unimportant shoved
to one side and said this is not
relevant not to the economy not to the
society this is something we are just
going to take for granted but maybe it
is relevant maybe it&#39;s the key to this
whole fourth Industrial Revolution thank
you
