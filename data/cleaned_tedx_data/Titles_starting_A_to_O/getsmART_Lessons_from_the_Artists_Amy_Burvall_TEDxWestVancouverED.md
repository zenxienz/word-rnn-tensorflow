exactly a hundred years ago 1917 and
Marcel Duchamp pays six bucks for the
submission fee for a special art exhibit
that&#39;s gonna happen in New York and this
unconventional piece of Arts a common
personal urinal signed our mutt and she
coolly titled fountain well no one knows
if you shouldn&#39;t actually made it or he
kind of hinted that he had a friend with
a pseudonym who produced it but
expectedly it was rejected and stuck in
the back for safe hiding but Duchamp
hired a photographer to take a now
iconic photo of the work and when this
photo appeared in a magazine called the
blind man shortly thereafter an
anonymous editor commented he
highlighted its significance he chose it
he gave this mundane thing new meaning
he questioned arts what it was he
actually created new thought I nobody
knows if it was like an a test of
freedom of expression or a practical
joke but we do know it was a pivotal
moment in art history and it paved the
way for art movements to come and it it
actually makes us question the way
things are and maybe even makes its
reframe tradition now artists dip into
our humanity and a stir us from our
apathy and molest artists make us think
in ways we&#39;d never imagined and they
paved the way for innovation with their
poetic verses and their canvases in
their films artists are dangerous
that&#39;s why totalitarian governments seek
to stamp out free thinking artists and
replace them with state condoned art
thinking like an artist is dangerous
it&#39;s a threat to the status quo and
that&#39;s exactly why we should do it no I
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cuz like I dress a
little bit funky but and I&#39;m always
sketching usually on my phone actually
these sketches were on my phone but
people always come up to me and say are
you an artist and my go-to response is
no I&#39;m just a teacher I&#39;m just a teacher
until I realized that being a teacher is
precisely like being an artist right and
that perhaps we should rethink our
labels like different it and and really
honor the artistry of being an educator
and also in fact a learner now I think
we can learn a lot we can get a lot of
insight from studying the lives of
famous artists and not their iconic
works and their successes but actually
their foibles and their jagged edges and
the ways in which they worked so to
think like an artist we&#39;re gonna
remember three conveniently alliterated
for your memories pleasure points be
porous push past and play now if you
think of it being porous you might think
sponge and that&#39;s exactly you&#39;re right
on target with that I think creativity
is about connecting dots connecting dots
remixes that exist making new
connections but in order to connect dots
you gotta have dots so how do we grow
our dot forests so that we have rich
source material to draw upon and that&#39;s
something you can do by cultivating a
sense of what I call wonder lest now
everyone knows what wanderlust is but
one or less is sort of taking it all in
really looking rather than just seeing
it&#39;s finding the WoW and the now and I
love this quote by Van Gogh we are
surrounded by poetry on all sides and
very few people admire enough for venko
his world was his muse and he found
paintings in the poorest cottages and in
the dirtiest corners also pop artist
Andy Warhol was awed by the ordinary
he gave new context to stuff we have in
our pantries like soup cans and brillo
pads really giving them new meaning he
said you have to be you have to take the
things that would ordinarily bore you
and make them suddenly thrill you but
sometimes what&#39;s around us is not so
pretty and we had to find the beauty and
the broken and no artist really does
this better than I think Frida Kahlo who
suffered so much so much pain from
childhood polio but also a terrible
trolley accident and her paintings and
sketchings were brutal
self-portraits of her suffering of her
perceived mental and physical flaws also
impede a toulouse-lautrec
was similarly afflicted in fact when he
was a kid he was bedridden and that&#39;s
why he learned how to draw I love how
he&#39;s attracted to the broken of society
the people of the Parisian night and
through his sketching
he tells their stories and empowers them
rather than exploiting them
now I love this aesthetic as the
Japanese has said it called wabi-sabi
it&#39;s the beauty of the impermanence and
the imperfect and one of the practices
is something called kinsuka ROI it&#39;s
filling the cracks of broken pottery
with gold to accentuate their scars
their history rather than trying to
disguise it if we can like Michelangelo
see the angel in the marble and carved
to set it free we can realize our own
potential but also the potential and
others who might seem a bit broken or
need the most love being an artist
thinking like an artist really means
having the confidence specially to live
your own truth and I had the privilege
of actually going to Mexico City this
year and I got to visit Freitas actual
house it&#39;s called the blue house and
they had a special exhibit about her
wardrobe and was what struck me was how
she really owned where she was from and
who she was now she&#39;s famous for these
flower crowns and flowy skirts and big
jewelry and people actually said she was
a walking circus but what really was
interesting was how she used her body
casts and her corsets to display her
passion for her political views
communism in this case Pablo Picasso too
knew the power of using the platform
you&#39;re given to really stand for
something in 1937 he was supposed to be
working on this piece for the World&#39;s
Fair something to extol new technology
and then he heard about the bombing by
General Franco of a northern Basque town
and he completely bent his whole work
and started something new and this
magnificent masterpiece of a mural
talked about technology in a different
way talked about the horrors of modern
war Guernica
you said at this time that paintings are
not decorate apartments they&#39;re actually
an instrument of war he knew that art is
supposed to spark questions rather than
provide answers and he lived in the why
not he said other people see what is and
asked why I see what could be and asked
why not
living the why not is a little bit scary
living in the question is a little bit
uncomfortable
the poet Keats called this negative
capability it&#39;s being okay with the
uncertain and in questions we get the
truth
so I don&#39;t know if anybody teaches like
little kids but they have wonder walls
and kindergarten classrooms I always
wonder why do we have wonder walls in
high school classrooms and why don&#39;t we
all pin down our queries and some
massive notebooks like Leonardo da Vinci
really live in the question because
cultivating a sense of curiosity
necessitates embracing ambiguity but we
also need to be curious outside of
ourselves we need to procure a posse and
the impressionist artists were really
good at that they they dad they drank
together ate together made art together
even slapped on each other&#39;s floors you
know I was going there but they knew
that the best creativity is
combinatorial it comes from the
intermingling of ideas and people and
through Picasso as well he surrounded
himself with creative folk and each one
was like a little muse to him and he
kind of gathered what he wanted out of
each person and refashioned it into
something else and it&#39;s important as it
is to grow a network of minds that you
can trust
I call them creative soulmates I think
it&#39;s also very worthwhile to break your
bubble in 1853 Japan broke out of its
isolation after many many years and the
Impressionists in Europe we&#39;re so
excited by this unfamiliar aesthetic and
they started remixes from Japanese art I
think it&#39;s a lot it&#39;s very much akin to
what we can do today with global
connection with global connection not
just being connected but really pursuing
connections outside our little bubble of
like-minded friends really looking for
new
effective and respecting them we need to
push past thinking like an artist means
pushing past sometimes physical and
mental ailments sometimes what the world
throws at us and of course the
proverbial status quo the best artists
never ask permission they make movements
I love this quote from Warhol yeah it&#39;s
you have to do stuff that ordinary
people don&#39;t understand because those
are the only good things this is a one
of it most interesting paintings I found
in San Francisco this is a Monet believe
it or not it&#39;s very dark but it&#39;s his
first big fail that&#39;s why I took the
picture it&#39;s his first reject and you
know in the 1800s the Academy taboos are
dominated the French art scene and
people like Monet and Degas Pizarro had
to form a co-op in order to show their
progressive artwork and it was a snarky
critic who gave them their name he said
oh you know embryonic wallpaper is like
more finished than Monet&#39;s impression
sunrise but he didn&#39;t talk like a valley
girl anything but uh that was my being
snarky um but the Impressionists
owned it they actually loved this
derogatory title and it maybe even
inspired them because you see you have
to be you above all else right and I
love this quote by it Franco that
normality is a paved road it&#39;s really
comfy to walk on right but no flowers
grow on it sometimes you have to channel
the bad to the rad da Vinci Leonardo da
Vinci was a bastard but actually he was
really nice and quite refined but what I
mean was his dad didn&#39;t marry his mom
and this was really bad in Renaissance
Italy because she couldn&#39;t go to formal
school but this is exactly what worked
for him because he got turned on by
experiential inquiry based learning he
rose above his roots he moved on and up
in fact I think he died in the palace of
the French King as with the title
resident genius which is something I
think is a great job title um but he was
able to see that curiosity Trump&#39;s the
Canon you know that his experience and
his experience
was actually more important than any
academic tradition and I think this
rebellious attitude should be kind of
nurtured by us and also the young people
in our charts because that&#39;s how he came
up with all his innovations Harvard
researchers did a study on something
called the creative stereotype and they
found that people who identified or who
imagined themselves I guess as eccentric
poets performed more creatively thought
more divergently than those who
identified themselves as rigid
librarians but please if your librarian
don&#39;t take it friends because every
librarian I&#39;ve ever met is not rigid and
they&#39;re fab but that was a study and I
think we have to stop the pout sometimes
and psych ourselves out no one really
did this better I think is a good
example as Michelangelo Michelangelo
always thought of himself more of as
sculptor rather than a painter and I
didn&#39;t help that rival da Vinci said
that his bodies looked like there was
stuff with walnuts that&#39;s not a bit nice
but when the Pope gave him the Sistine
Chapel Commission it was like ah I
thought it was gonna like get to carve
your tomb for the next 20 years till I&#39;m
dead and now I&#39;m gonna hit hit with this
logistical nightmare and doing a fresco
that I&#39;m not even good at and he really
did think it was a conspiracy against
him but he decided to fail flamboyantly
as Punk Godfather Malcolm McLaren would
say and he said you know I might be an
amateur but no one is going to question
my ambition so he worked beyond his will
he made that scaffolding and the court
asked a folding system and of course he
ended up producing one of the most
breathtaking pieces of art that humanity
has ever come across sometimes we have
to work beyond our will he knew that
creativity works in constraints that&#39;s
when it&#39;s best and sometimes the way out
of the box is via the rules sometimes we
don&#39;t have enough time or resources so I
think of toulouse-lautrec sketching on
cardboard scraps sometimes we are under
the weather physically or mentally I
think of Matisse who couldn&#39;t paint
anymore he was bedridden so he invented
a new type of art which was paper
cutting drawing with scissors and then I
think of creativity as catharsis
I think if Edouard Munk trying to
capture the angst of the age and his own
personal suffering through expressionist
works such as The Scream so how can we
squeeze out potential from pain perhaps
in finding strength in a smile then she
said I love people that can smile in
trouble and gather strength from
distress we should marvel at the
mistakes we&#39;re all said you know if you
do something exactly wrong it always
comes up something it&#39;s true right this
brings us to the last big concept the
practice of play the play can be
frivolous but I believe it&#39;s how we
learn and sometimes we have to unlearn
sometimes we need to rethink and have
kind of a beginner&#39;s mind one of my this
is a great quote at last I don&#39;t know
how to draw Toulouse Lautrec said at the
end of his life one of my favorite
examples of unlearning is Picasso&#39;s
now-famous bull abstraction he tried to
get to the boldness of the bull by
tearing away at it and famously this is
supposedly used rumour has it by Apple
designers to influence their thinking
and simplicity for Picasso subtraction
was sublime
he said you know I&#39;ll paint a wild horse
and you might not see the horse but
you&#39;ll see the wildness so how could we
rethink things rethink Convention and
get to the essence of something we might
have to dance on the edge of the
unexpected they didn&#39;t call Michelangelo
the divine one for nothing I mean no one
would touch that 14-foot marble block
for 20 years
and no one would think to depict the
biblical David as a full-grown man
rather than an adolescent as it had
always been done but mastery comes with
muscle he played with a purpose and he
worked so hard he said you know if
people knew how hard I worked my talent
wouldn&#39;t seem so great and his famous
attributed motto
Angora Amparo in every city on Quora
Amparo
now summertime Angora in Barra it means
I&#39;m still learning or yet I&#39;m learning
and this is such a lesson to us all as
lifelong learners and I encourage you to
be transparent
about that so that students can see that
learning does not stop after University
right do not quench your inspiration and
your imagination don&#39;t be a slave to
your model I think I would say I like to
think of rethinking my craft all the
time making like Madonna you know
changing it up and we need to reflect on
our craft Picasso did this in his
different periods like the blue and rose
and cubist really thinking and
incorporating new strategies according
to the changing times one way to do this
of course is leveraging the tech of the
day I work a lot with teachers
incorporating digital technology in
their pedagogy I&#39;m fascinated by this
little multimedia studio in our pockets
it&#39;s a little bit like that handheld
device right and even more so like this
majorly revolutionary technological
innovation which is the metal paint -
believe it or not because the metal
paint tubes actually free the artists
from the studio so that they could go
outside on plein air and capture the
fleeting moments and the changing light
it completely changed with that
profession what art was that little
paint tube and also photography which
happened around the same time these are
digga digga as actual photographs see
the Impressionists didn&#39;t shy away from
these novelties photography could have
putted them out of a job but instead
they concurred with them and pushed the
boundaries of these technologies and so
how they could be incorporated into
their work they reimagined what their
profession could be so I think in this
day of AR and VR and AI and the Internet
of Things that thinking like an artist
is never so important where play is
there&#39;s power and playing with these
technologies that can that can help us
create much like our predecessors did
with the printing press or the plume or
film or photography now I take van
Gogh&#39;s advice I try to make something
good every day even if it&#39;s little and
then by all means encourage you to share
your creations this is my mom and when I
was a kid she used to make cookies and
then too much to my chagrin she&#39;d give
them all away
the neighbors and when I got upset about
that she say you know what&#39;s the point
of making something if you&#39;re not going
to share it
little did I know she was schooling me
and Picasso because the meaning of life
is to find your gift and the purpose is
to give it away so whether you work in a
classroom or corporate boardroom whether
you work with a computer or a camera
remember the world is your studio I&#39;d
like you to think like an artist to be
porous to push past and definitely
definitely most definitely importantly
play and imagine see today what others
won&#39;t understand until tomorrow
