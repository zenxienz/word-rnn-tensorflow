if you think that this thing is a GPS
please raise up your hands
pretty much everyone but you&#39;re not
completely right this is a car
navigation system and GPS is the name of
the American satellite navigation system
that contributes to make it work but I
don&#39;t blame you we all got used to call
it GPS thanks to I believe very good
marketing from our American colleagues
now whew
how many of you know the name of the
European counterpart you see the
American are much better at marketing
could you give the name Galileo
correct you made me happy GPS and other
large scale space programs are normally
reserved to the most powerful nations as
a tool for supremacy today I would like
to to share a personal opinion on why I
believe that the European Union can also
develop such programs but with a
different goal in mind which is to
ensure peace and dry prosperity so let&#39;s
start to look at the GNSS landscape so
we have GPS which delivers both military
and civilian service NATO member states
and a few others they have access to the
military part of it we have as well
grown us which is built by Russia for
more less the same reasons and so is
doing China with its beta system so if
we have GPS full access to it but the
access to GLONASS and and Baidu and all
of this for free why do we need galileo
why do we need this civilian
GNSS it&#39;s a good question and I have
both a defensive and a progressive
argument for you to explain why we need
such a system so our society and even
our military they are addicted to
satellite navigation we all got used to
the fact that we know exactly where we
are all the time
and even the economy is heavily
dependent on navigation we talk about
more than 6% of the GDP can we in Europe
consider that our access to foreign
Genesis is good enough do you trust this
gentleman to be tomorrow as generous as
they are today it reminds me of an old
friend of Mines we was so happy to use
his neighbor&#39;s Wi-Fi for free until they
put a password to it it&#39;s like that you
know you need it so you get your own
call it autonomy if you like I call it
common sense I have also a strong
progressive argument while we are
developing our own system why not
striving at delivering better services
and this is what we are doing Galileo is
the reality since last year it delivered
its first services to the people so if
you have a smartphone with Gallio inside
on top of GPS you will get a better
position location accuracy in the city
specialist and in between the AI
buildings this is because GPS and Gallio
they can work seamlessly so the
combination of the two lead to a higher
number of satellites in view now if
you&#39;re a sailor kite surfer like me your
bag lighter a mountain biker adding a
personal location beacon will help save
your life much faster indeed galio
complement other satellites to locate
you in less than 10 minutes wherever you
are in the world and this is instead of
up to four hours as it was like
the past and by the end by the end of
2018 all new vehicle in the EU will be
equipped with the ecole emergency
services system and ends by Dario and
Ecole will save lives in case of an
accident wherever you are in Europe the
closest emergency rescue team will be
automatically called now on top of this
defensive and progressive rationals I
have also a third argument which is
maybe the most powerful one and
certainly the most emotional one and one
that I don&#39;t share very often because
it&#39;s not easy to convey so I will give
it a try the real beauty of Galileo is
about cooperation to achieve a goal
which is higher than what the individual
partners can do alone I&#39;ve been working
for 18 years on the Gallio program it&#39;s
the largest european space project at
the beginning many people believed we
could never make such a complex system
in a non-military like organization and
yes we had the serious difficulties but
yet I believe the complexity comes more
from the fact that we in Europe need to
take into account the different views of
the 28 member states rather than the
civilian nature of the system and
sometimes during the long and complex
consultation process between Europe
something unexpected occurs I was the
chairman of a working group who was in
charge of finding ways how to make
Galileo signals compatible with GPS so
the challenge was to maintain the
ambition to deliver first-class Genesis
for the civilian while complying with
the military requirements mainly driven
by GPS but based on existing technology
there was no solution to this problem
you either get the high performance for
the civilian
all the military requirement not both so
the member states they started to split
apart around this dilemma and then the
political pressure from the Americans
but you Nell from Belgium winter from
Germany Luhan from France
Julian Hal from Spain and Johnny from
Falls and a few others they add the
technical skills to solve this
diplomatic Channel it took them several
months of joint work to develop the
necessary technology and they found this
signal here in blue which even exceeded
the initial expectation and the beauty
and challenge to define and defend a
common European progressive position led
to an innovation a truly European
innovation and there are many more such
stories like that in the gay program and
be sure you cannot find them in the
books
so yes developing a European GNSS will
mean going through many obstacles like
this ones but in all these situations
the Member States the program
organization the woman and the man
behind sitting around the same table are
discovering their shared responsibility
and the spirit of compromise in the good
sense of it the empathy and from time to
time even innovation magically apply
ladies and gentlemen do you see these
two euro coins this is a maje the system
cost every citizen in the you each year
and in return you do not only get the
autonomy and independence the better
location a new smartphone more lives
saved in the oceans in the mountains or
in the road
you also get jobs and prosperity in
Europe that can be valued three to five
times the initial investment but most of
all we have demonstrated the
value-added of being Europeans 28 member
states can work together to achieve
things way bigger than what the kudu
rune and the additional afford to build
consensus translate into a more solid a
more sustainable final result thank you
very much
use Galileo you deserve it
