my mom always used to tell me when
there&#39;s a room there&#39;s always a way
there&#39;s nothing you can&#39;t do
I didn&#39;t really understand what she
meant at the age of five years old but
as I grew up I started to understand the
effect of being positive and having a
strong royal power no matter what
obstacles you faced during the course of
your life I am sure you&#39;ve heard this
frequently but I have lived and survived
because of these words I have stroke at
the age of five most of you in the
audience know I had an injury when I was
younger well this is the story behind
that injury I can&#39;t really answer the
question of how it happened because I
truly don&#39;t remember I don&#39;t remember
the feeling I don&#39;t remember what I was
doing the one thing I can tell you is
what my family told me happened it was
December of 2005 and we were sitting in
my grandparents house and I was in my
grandma&#39;s lap and all of a sudden I
became unresponsive
they tried talking to me but still no
response they realized something was
wrong with me when I wouldn&#39;t respond to
a bar chocolate they took me to the
emergency immediately let me go through
several MRIs to figure out what was
wrong and mean--you I had hemiplegia on
the left hemisphere meaning that my
right side was spastic and partially
paralyzed because my right leg was so
weak and the bones were so weak I
developed a new way of walking which is
quite common among children with
hemiplegia accounts started to develop
on the side of my foot by the time I was
seven it became noticeable to the public
since that point I needed to constantly
be in a leg brace up until my first
surgery on June 23rd 2010 their first
leg breaks I woke him up to my knee and
had rotating hinges at the ankle and
when my anchor was able to form the
right movement I then shifted to a brace
from my ankle to the tip of my toes and
this was all going to prevent me from
walking on the edge of my foot my first
surgery was a tendon transfer and tendon
elongation I didn&#39;t really know what
that meant but that wasn&#39;t the important
part the looks I got for sitting in a
wheelchair for six weeks were important
they range from ingots of pity to looks
of sympathy and anywhere in between it&#39;s
when you&#39;re in those situations that you
really begin to notice the facial
expressions and what they all mean
it made me feel useless and hopeless
I&#39;ll care about the cast removed and
rehabilitation begun you&#39;re not to paint
I have to go through was realize you to
be insurmountable during recovery I had
to wear leg length brace just to keep my
knee from bending and allow my foot time
to recover
then leg brace unfortunately was
uncomfortable it made me sweat quite a
bit and I hated it from the minute I
wore it but there was no way out of it
so I stuck with it not only was I
supposed to have physical strength to
keep up with the pain but I also needed
the mental strength which at certain
points I doubted I even had to begin
with for children one of the most common
questions asked is why me why don&#39;t I
have to be the one to go through so it
could have been anyone else in the world
the amount of years I spent thinking
about these questions I&#39;ve only just hit
my revelatory moment and this revelation
is something worth sharing as anyone
with a stroke can definitely relate the
reason is no more than that the world
wants to show you what you can do nice
to emphasize you the incredible amount
of strength that you have strokes in my
perspective are tests for two things
perseverance and endurance how much pain
can you injure
how much can you push before letting
life drown you the more you fight the
better you&#39;ll feel about yourself and
for those that have gone through a
stroke or something similar to it you
know that feeling of victory that
feeling in your heart that you did
something today that you couldn&#39;t do the
day before is astounding and definitely
a sponsor to me each time it may be
something so small such as moving one
toe up and down if I could make the
entire audience feel the way I did after
I took my first step after my first
surgery I would without hesitation it&#39;s
mesmerizing that&#39;s the only word I can
use to describe it you feel flooded with
joy and your heart couldn&#39;t beat any
faster you&#39;re at the same time you&#39;re
relieved all those exercises that you
viewed as useless and weren&#39;t doing you
any good but you did them anyway well
they finally paid off you&#39;ve done it
what you you doesn&#39;t possible day before
and that feeling is the most rewarding
feeling in the world
those moment
are crucial children the thing is
children won&#39;t see themselves improving
they don&#39;t want to stay stuck in that
same mindset with the same future the
one they have now a stroke is something
that has such a large impact at such a
young age it does rarely talks about or
discussed I want to break the barrier
that&#39;s preventing us from talking about
her being proud about it the way I see
it is that by talking about my stroke
I&#39;m making myself the victim and putting
myself at center of attention I hate
that feeling so much because my story
just like all other children who have
suffered like I have is not a pity story
it&#39;s a story of strength and success I
don&#39;t live this view I don&#39;t have this
feeling it&#39;s similar among children with
had strokes I feel like I tell people
about my stroke will be what defines me
whenever people look at me they&#39;ll
immediately associate me with strokes
and that&#39;s what I want to avoid because
when you call someone a bird you&#39;re
subconsciously making him or her
inferior to you and I don&#39;t want that
because strokes truly show what a person
can do with determination and willpower
belief in myself was one of the main
things that got me through it all I used
to think I was the only one to go
through it and I&#39;m sure other children
used to or to this day think the same
thing it was only till the end of 2015
that I realized it I feel like I owe
this realization to all the children who
are suffering you are not alone it may
feel like you&#39;re isolated and have no
one around you who relates to what
you&#39;re going through but you have people
who support you and that&#39;s worth so much
more and you&#39;ll begin to realize that
when people are positive around you
their positivity will be reflected in
everything you do it&#39;s not the physical
movement that hurts it&#39;s the loneliness
that accompanies it
12 the children who have faced what I
faced and worse
you can survive it and when you do
things the world doesn&#39;t expect from you
you will thrive and empower the people
around you
since my fourth surgery in 2014 I worked
hard to gain the muscle that wasn&#39;t
missing when I was younger it started
out with bodyweight exercises I used to
do in physiotherapy it involved a lot
stretching and was made especially for
children with lack of mobility after one
year physiotherapy my therapist told me
I was too strong to come back and that&#39;s
when I started personal training
personal training was rigorous and
that&#39;s what most people don&#39;t enjoy
about it I loved it it made me get that
feeling of achieving the impossible but
I guess you could say I&#39;m addicted to so
I continued with it I then began
weightlifting which mean we feel like I
could do anything because I had the
strength to weightless it started out
with bicep curls I used to do with two
kgs in each hand another did the more my
work for weight lifting increased I
ended up being able to do seven pull-ups
after four years of personal training
which I couldn&#39;t be happier about I can
also not do twelve bicep curls 15 kg
weights which may not seem like a lot to
you
but it is to me and that&#39;s all that
matters in the end to keep myself from
becoming weak again I played basketball
all the time especially in between
training sessions every year I go to
school basketball tryouts for the past
six years and every year they make their
list of names accepted and my name is
never one of those names nevertheless I
continue to go because I believe in the
fact that you miss every shot you don&#39;t
take the slightest chance that I might
make it it&#39;s still a chance no matter
how small it is this year I&#39;ve made it
and I couldn&#39;t be happier to be a part
of it
I&#39;m the manager of the 2016-2017 varsity
girls basketball team and was also lucky
enough to get the chance to play with
them at one of our away games which I
couldn&#39;t be more honored to be a part of
if I didn&#39;t have the stroke I wouldn&#39;t
be able to do what I do today so I&#39;m not
ashamed of it instead I&#39;m proud of it
and proud to say I had a stroke giving
quotes from people who had an impact on
me may change the way you look at your
life as it definitely changed the way I
look at mine the one quote I&#39;ve held on
since this experience began was it&#39;s not
the mode that breaks you down it&#39;s the
way you carry it there are people in
this world will tell you you&#39;re not good
enough when you&#39;re feeling unstoppable
well they can doubt yourself when you&#39;ve
never felt more grounded or more certain
how you react is what creates you what
people are seeing you what defines you
for this reason be positive and show the
world what you&#39;re made of because I know
that every single one of you has
strengths just like I did and every
single person in this room has the
potential to live an outstanding life
all it takes is one step thank you
