when I was 17 years old I thought I had
everything figured out I was on my way
to college about to play a college sport
I knew what job I wanted after college
until one day everything changed I was
in a horrible car accident say the least
it was like any other day mean a couple
buddies were hanging out it was really
hot we were like man we got to go for a
swim so we drove over normal day I was
sitting in the front seat when suddenly
we were struck by a vehicle going 70
miles per hour upon impact my seat belt
failed my head went through the
passenger side window my left arm
followed as our car flipped I was thrown
55 feet through the air when I hit the
ground everything went black when I
regained consciousness I was pinned to
underneath the car with the tire resting
on my face I couldn&#39;t help the fight to
breathe
I continued to spit out blood and glass
and I couldn&#39;t feel my legs
after what felt like a lifetime the EMTs
arrived and rushed me to the emergency
room when I arrived there it was like a
scene out of a TV show or a movie it was
chaotic I was rushed right into a CT
scan to diagnose what was wrong with me
I was diagnosed as having 16 breaks in
my pelvis 2 in my sacrum an internal
bleeding that was slowly killing me I
remember laying on a table with
countless doctors and nurses all working
on different parts of me when the head
surgeon came up to me and said son
we&#39;re gonna have to perform surgery to
save your life it was in this moment
that I realized that everything I
thought was in store for my future was a
pigment of my imagination I went into
surgery and hours later I was considered
stable I had won the battle with man&#39;s
greatest fear death but there was gonna
be a long road to recovery I was going
to have to spend four to six months in a
wheelchair and over twelve months of
physical therapy being 18 and lying on
the table when a surgeon tells you that
you&#39;re fighting for your life can you
imagine what that must feel like it was
terrifying I was a helpless child as I
was lying there in the hospital
reminiscing over what just happened in
contemplating my future I got a call my
brother was coming in to visit me he
knew that this transition of me being an
athlete and an outdoorsman was going to
be tough for me in a wheelchair so he
brought a gift the gift was a GoPro he
thought it would be great if I channeled
my energy into creative energy this
changed my life not only because I just
won affray with death but because I just
undiscovered a hidden passion a passion
for storytelling before I knew it I was
telling stories of everything my friends
my families my Christmas parties and
even the baseball team in fact my
college found my baseball video ended up
hiring me and buying the video when I
realized I could make some money I was
like yes let&#39;s go amen
but I knew I needed to get a lot better
so I turned to the Internet this
beautiful thing we have at our
fingertips we can learn almost anything
from it before I knew it I spent
countless hours watching tutorials out
of color how to cut how to edit but my
favorite thing to do was to watch
national videos one day I came across
the video it looks similar to this and I
could not figure out for the life of me
how it was filmed at first you thought
you know it was low to the water maybe
it was somebody on a boat and suddenly
it starts to rise and before I knew what
it was in the clouds
well after some research I found out
that it was a drone looks similar to
like this however at this point in time
drones were not a household name this
was a quadcopter I found one online and
I was like yes let&#39;s get this I have no
money but I&#39;m gonna eat McDonald&#39;s for
the rest of my life it seems like I was
excited about the perspective I was
gonna be able to share and show but
really I think what I loved about it was
rooted deeply inside me the fact that I
was stationary and bedridden for the
previous four months and this device
allowed me to be free and fly and see
whatever I wanted I had so many big
plans on what I was gonna film but I
knew that this wasn&#39;t only going to
benefit me I thought that this could
benefit other people and other
businesses at first I thought about what
used a helicopter and what other
businesses had benefitted from this
angle as you can see here this is a golf
course filmed with a helicopter and this
angle helps golfers play the course
right I&#39;m not a great golfer so I need
all the help I can get but you can see
the positioning of the sand and the
fairway there were only two problems
with this technology the first one being
that it was tremendously expensive in
the upwards of 25,000 dollars to film a
course and secondly it was dangerous
you&#39;re putting someone&#39;s life in harm&#39;s
way so they were obviously not going to
fly too low to the ground my thought was
to replace the helicopter with a
low-cost alternative in a drone well
being 18 extremely naive I may have made
up a fake email Scott
five tours 2014 not sure why I added the
year there but I did I emailed every
course in Maine and I called every
course until I finally got a meeting the
day of the meeting
I skipped Western Civ sorry mom I put
some gel in my hair and I put on the
same suit I wore to prom and I showed up
to the meeting and I&#39;m looking this guy
dead in the eye and he&#39;s just looking at
me like what are you doing man you&#39;re 18
like why are you trying to be so serious
and I look at him dead serious and I say
I can revolutionize the way we film golf
courses
he just started Chubby&#39;s like yeah okay
so he&#39;s like okay how and I told him my
story and my idea at this point in time
he didn&#39;t know that I hadn&#39;t even
received my drone yet and I had never
flown one long story short we walked out
that meeting with the papers signed we
had her first client a couple days later
I finally got my drone in the mail and
I&#39;ll tell you the learning curve was
steep I crash it more times than I had
successful flights but eventually we
successfully filmed a golf course look
at me back then skinny man and I was so
excited about the product and the final
videos that I went straight to the golf
course I always loved showing people my
videos in person so I could see their
reaction well the owner of this course
was a 75 year old man and he had worked
on the course previously before
inheriting it for almost 50 years
so you can tell like the amount of blood
and work and sweat that he put into this
and you&#39;re probably not gonna believe me
but when I actually showed him the video
it brought tears to his eyes that&#39;s how
passionate he was about his craft and
his course and all the work he put in I
cried a little bit too but leave that
out I knew that this was the moment when
I really really really felt passionate
about something I knew that I loved
helping people
I loved working with people that were
also so passionate about what they were
doing since then my company has filmed
resorts golf courses weddings
promotional videos all over the world
and my passion has allowed me to do this
but I want to leave you guys with a
lesson I learned along the way
it took me lying in bed fighting for my
life
faced with man&#39;s worst fear to realize
that there&#39;s fundamental blocks that
stop us from pursuing our passion these
blocks are the fear of risk rejection
and failure but they&#39;re within their
minor invisible barriers that stop you
from doing what you should and want you
don&#39;t have to be in a serious accident
fighting for your life to realize this
you just have to remember that beyond
these fears lie tremendous opportunity
thank you
