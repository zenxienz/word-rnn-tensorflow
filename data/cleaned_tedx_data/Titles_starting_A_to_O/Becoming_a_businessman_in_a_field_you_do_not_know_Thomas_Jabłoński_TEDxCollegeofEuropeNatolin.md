entrepreneurship is an art of being
unreasonable what does it mean it means
that it&#39;s sensible when you go to work
which will teach your profession
you&#39;ve got tournament salary limited
working hours benefits sometimes
business car it makes sense
what does not make sense it&#39;s choosing a
way of entrepreneurship in which you
haven&#39;t got time or money for vacation
hobbies sometimes even the social life
on the beginning of your journey you are
not earning money you even have to add
some to make your vision come true
furthermore you have to show your face
and take the responsibility for an idea
in which nine of ten cases will gonna
fail so for me it&#39;s like acting
unreasonable especially when you are
doing this in area you don&#39;t really know
I was growing up in small town in
Greater Poland me and my colleagues
groans in equal conditions our parents
were working hard during the week and on
Saturdays we went to the local market on
sand if you went to church you can call
it sweet home alabama&#39; and then every
kid want to be a businessman a lawyer a
doctor even a president and everything
was simple and and full of hope for
future and all of this things change
when we have to make our first adult
decision which high school should we
choose and we had once very nice high
school back in my hometown but we also
have got a plenty of better rank forty
kilometres from Poznan they will from my
town in Poznan and I knew that if I want
to expand my horizon&#39;s&#39; and make my
dreams come true
I cannot stuck in the place and I have
to go ahead
and it wasn&#39;t so obvious for my friends
because for them it was unnecessary
unreasonable and sometimes even
impossible especially when you have to

wake up every day and 5:30 go to train
and write to the town which you don&#39;t
know anybody but I made the decision and
I made a new friends with the same
hunger Hunger of knowledge which I have
and when we we were preparing to the
major exams one of them told me Tom
let&#39;s go to the United States right
after exams so for me it was truly
impossible because I&#39;ve got a lot of
reasons like you know we have to stay in
Poland because we want to apply it to
the college and United say it&#39;s it&#39;s
really far away and we have to collect
money for a ticket and thirdly nobody
can give us a visa okay so we are not
going that&#39;s sure but as you know who
want to do something is looking for
solutions and who don&#39;t want to is
looking for reasons and we really want
to go to the United States
so we sit down and analyze all the
objections and we were focusing on the
finding a solution so firstly
application we knew that if we pass all
the exams well we just have to prepare
all the documents put the envelope and
ask our parents to send it in the right
time okay second the money problem I
thought maybe I can ask my older brother
to lend me some money and I give him
back after my return he agreed so check
it was easy and the third obstacle was
actually interesting because I haven&#39;t
got any personal input of the decision
of giving me visa and I heard a lot of
stories like that is impossible to get a
visa especially whether you are having a
tournament job you are not a student yet
you haven&#39;t got dependent family so
you&#39;re a great candidate for emigrant
but for your information wasn&#39;t true you
we went to embassy and we told what is
our purpose of journey and that we have
to come back on September because we
start our college and they gave us a
visa for 10 years so check check check
and for me it was a signal that you know
every time when I got a problem I have
to find a solution so we went to United
States and United States impressed me by
the courage Ness and optimistic outlook
of life optimistic a lot of life and I
wanted to besides the the precious
memories I want it back into Poland some
bit of this optimistic approach and when
we were sitting with my friend and
eating a breakfast some older men came
to us and gave us a 20% coupon and from
this moment every time where we go every
when we were using coupons no couple of
doors save in our pocket and that was it
I thought ok if we are using the tutor
so early in the United States so
probably our peers in Poland will gonna
enjoy it too
and in this moment it wasn&#39;t a business
idea it was just a willingness of
sharing a good idea for savings so I
took the suitcase full of coupons and
came back to Poland and I thought ok if
it&#39;s so popular way of commercial in
United States it will be easy to
transform it in a Polish market we just
have to arrange some meetings sign some
contract until the end of the week we&#39;ll
be done
but it wasn&#39;t so easy after sending
thousands of emails made hundreds of
calls and arranged the dozens of
meetings after one month of work
we&#39;ve got round zero contracts signed so
I was I was terrified I was terrified
because I couldn&#39;t understand why such a
good idea in my opinion is not accepted
by the market and
such a good idea it&#39;s not accepted by
the market sorry
so I thought okay I have to knock to
every door know and talk to every
customer and ask him honestly why they
don&#39;t want to be a part of my idea and
they gave me a feedback I heard this
feedback and I decided to change change
change a little bit my offer and work
even twice harder so after one week we
signed the first contract and after one
month we issue a catalogue with over 50
companies inside so the concept was
ready but the problem was how to expand
this idea okay because I was I drove
from city to city and I was opening new
products but we knew that the with paper
catalogues it will be a problem to get
to the all the people who who need the
discounts and it will be problem with at
the new ones and the change the existing
ones so how we gonna do it we sit down
again and we only try to analyze all the
obstacles and we wanted to make it in
real time everywhere and for everybody
who wants to buy cheaper like to appear
in your pocket and that was it
that was the solution and the mobile
ruled the world because everything was
here however entering to the mobile
market in 2012 was really unreasonable
you know because almost nobody had got a
phone then and even if somebody has got
the internet connection was really bad
so the enter ending on the mobile market
on the in 2012 was the same like start
to selling in Internet in early 90s in
Poland when nobody has got a computer
yet
okay but we calculate this risk and we
were watching the we were observing the
social behavior and we following global
trends and we decide that we gonna take
this risk and we have to develop the
first polish application with coupons
and we are not regretting it because now
60% of poles are using smartphone and
this percentage is increasing every year
the question is how to enter to the
mobile market and deal with new
technology when you haven&#39;t got that
technological background as me right so
I&#39;ve got an information for for existing
in the future and the preneur the
message is it&#39;s not your job okay you
don&#39;t have to know how the electricity
is running to turn on the lamp and you
don&#39;t have to be a builder to build a
house and you don&#39;t have to know how car
works to move from one place to need out
to the other and you don&#39;t need to have
the technological background to enter to
the market of new technologies all you
need to do is to find the right person
and later a group of people which you
trust who you trust and they&#39;re gonna
help you to build a bridge between your
idea to the people who&#39;s gonna use it so
based on my experience what I recommend
you to do is always calculate the risk
always find the solution for your
problems
top with people and try to hear them
okay and if you will be working hard and
consequently you might gonna do it but
remember that on the top of it
those are always people who will help
you
all you need to do is you have to find
those people and trust them so I follow
my intuition and I build a team of great
people who helped me to the journey of
the top of the mobile market and thanks
to them I can probably say that we are a
leader of smart shopping application in
Poland providing over 100 million
coupons every month but still I don&#39;t
understand technology which is hidden
behind it thank you
