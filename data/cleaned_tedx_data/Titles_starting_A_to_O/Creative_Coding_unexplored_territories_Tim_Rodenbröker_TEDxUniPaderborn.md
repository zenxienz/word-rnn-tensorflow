I&#39;m going to talk about something that&#39;s
called creative coding and I&#39;m studying
the little story so this is a minstrel
school of design where I studied and
there was 2012 and we had a huge library
with treasures of books all about art
divine architecture and one of these
books is called generative design the
narrative design right so it contains
how it works like this one or this one
or this one so and as you can see
there&#39;s a huge complexity these words
right there&#39;s something really that
makes these words very complex and it
was I was sure that it&#39;s impossible to
create such things and such upwards with
the tools I was recently working with so
I asked myself what is the secret
ingredients of these artworks
and it is the fact that they are all
built with code right they are all built
with computer program in this case they
are all built with a programming
language called processing beautiful
word right and this is a programming
language for artists and designers so
2013 one year later I was graduating
from the demoscene er this went back to
my hometown paderborn because my parents
have an agency here where I worked and
since I&#39;m 15 I&#39;m a musician I may have a
chronic music and yeah one day I just
walked around and put up on and I met
someone called Patrick please raise your
hand once
and you know we were just chatting about
what could we do together you would like
to make a free project maybe something
uncommercial because he&#39;s a super
talented designer and says parties are
very important and also he has a huge
knowledge about computer programming so
we were just thinking about what people
we could do together that and we came up
with the idea that he could make visuals
of my music
I told him the boat you narrative design
and he was completely blown away right
absolutely
he still looks like this to the was to
the book to Josiah get to him he&#39;s just
world so cool okay you know he was just
studying the most stuff and just about I
think two or three months we were able
to do something like this
so as you can see there&#39;s me in front of
the stage and I mean there&#39;s a
projection and that&#39;s a very special
kind of projection because these are
audio reactive visuals that react to the
music in real time right
so Patrick wrote a software that takes
the music and transforms it into visuals
he wrote you use this processing program
to create a software that takes the
music and converts of individuals just a
few weeks later Stephan joined us and we
founded the in UV collective as a band
we were just well we had pretty cool
bookings from the first moment like the
juicing is Festival or the reception
sermons are beautiful one and for the
glass enforcement so the window up on
very beautiful places in just one year
that was because we had this unique
selling point we had these audio
reactive visuals that really were
responding to the music in real time
which is what&#39;s very special this is
kind of how it looks you know acceptance
just see one of these electronic drums
and something on the stage is just
happening in time after one year I can
completely board making music because I
was already making music since 15 years
and just felt like okay it&#39;s great to
have great gifts it&#39;s great to play big
locations but at the same time I became
super interested in what Patrick was
doing with this creative coding stuff so
I wanted to learn that and I wanted
really to quit that music or pause that
music thing from in my life and go on
with something completely new and this
was creative coding and one well I asked
Patrick if you could please teach me on
words and we rented a wooden cabin and
width of its ontology
no internet connection no cell phone
when actually two guys two laptops five
days just coding that would completely
weird right but we had a great time and
I really enjoyed it
and after that channel was able to do
something like this so as you can see
there&#39;s this huge incredible complexity
here and in the meantime anything&#39;s
happened because
yeah Patrick and me we both will adapt
our artistic identities and published
our works on exhibitions and in the
internet that was 2015 today many things
just evolved this is one of my works
I&#39;ve just made for the PSD medium
society which is a huge media wall in
Muenster tips 40 meters high and well
this is just something like a generic
music video I&#39;ve made and people can
stream the music by an iPhone that&#39;s
pretty cool and this is just a mock-up
that means this is not real but I&#39;m
thinking about how can I bring this kind
of art into the world without forcing
people to look onto the screens without
forcing people to look onto their phone
or whatever I want to bring this kind of
art into the world and yeah that for me
we just share an office now we have an
office here in parabot and dream of the
future and I&#39;m looking forward to
develop more interesting projects in the
future
so now let&#39;s focus on what creative
coding is exactly okay so creative
coding means programming with an
artistic purpose that means we use
programming languages in this case
processing which looks like this to
create art and design or architecture or
whatever and yeah it&#39;s just like you
know you have got something like a text
editor and you just write your code in
and the computer is going to do exactly
what you&#39;ve just typed in there and it&#39;s
pretty amazing but there&#39;s one more
thing that&#39;s much more amazing than this
it&#39;s the fact that every single project
and that&#39;s a discovery I&#39;ve made follows
a simple pattern that repeats from one
project to the other over and over again
right it&#39;s very simple it&#39;s no rocket
science just like this remember just a
few minutes ago I told you that Pat
report is software the taste in music
and convert it into something new right
so what if you take this as an Essen
creativity
to create new ideas for projects so
Patrick took the music and transform it
into visuals what if you just use these
parameters and change them to create new
ideas for projects right so to clarify
this a little bit I&#39;ve made a mind map
I&#39;m just not going to talk for five
minutes you can study it no just kidding
on the left side here you see input
possibilities on the right side you&#39;ll
see yellow possibilities that means
there are incredibly many things
possible and there&#39;s a really
interesting discovery that made I just
simplify this a little bit for you just
to clarify it on the left side just
imagine we couldn&#39;t take we could take
music or sound or our text or big data
sets they&#39;re huge big data sets
available on the infinite right of our
image archives right maybe the Museum of
Modern Art or something just it&#39;s
providing thousands of images online you
can use for your artworks for the webcam
style or user interaction or geo data I
can also look at this range perfect or
the newsfeed maybe the New York Times or
something right to convert it into
something different
riccardi right side we can make
interactive installations data
visualizations sculptures graphics and
he mentioned solid even furniture you
may imagine maybe it&#39;s kind of a chair
made of your favorite book well I don&#39;t
know how it looks but it&#39;s just possible
to connect these things to design new
ideas for design and well creative
coding projects
that&#39;s very excited so here are some
cases to clarify this a little bit this
is one of the works that has been
presented in this book generic design
very thanks many things to settle a
keeper from informative for allowing me
to use it for stuff of their
their portfolio this is a Wikipedia
visualization so every single bubble is
representing one Archy 1vd periodical
and if you click on one of these bubbles
it just reveals all the other the QPD
articles that are instinct inside this
article so this is a very experimental
way of exploring data maybe it is
useless but it&#39;s just beautiful right
okay you&#39;re not convinced okay next one
so no before I have to say I just want
to clarify this pattern the input is
Wikipedia the pattern is very simple
right
the input is the Camellia and the output
is an interactive infographic so let&#39;s
have a look on another project this is
also by the studio informative once
again things to informative to Berlin
it&#39;s called an in Sun sculpture and it
is it takes the motion capture data that
means it takes a video signer and
converts it into a 3d animation of
titles just flying around or space
anyway and yeah this is a very nice work
I think yes it has been exhibited in
different places and it&#39;s quite no in a
scene so it takes the motion data right
takes the motion of this dance and
converts it into the 3d animation so the
pattern again right one more work by my
friend Patrick deceive and follow me
this is a software creating infinite
generative collage that means he takes
huge image archives - yeah load into
processing and convert them into collage
like this
Justin - it&#39;s great this a little bit we
just made 100 collage for you all
following the same system and they just
look like this they are infinite
possibilities to combine these images
with each other right so this is a I
think this is very interesting tendency
for the future of design but that&#39;s
another topic okay so even put what is
the important yeah right what is the
upper kids it&#39;s written down there okay
that&#39;s so you can read it so the output
is G narrative collapsed right I&#39;m
coming to an end of my talking and I
just want to say two things two more
things you know I&#39;ve learned many things
in the last two years I&#39;ve learned how
to make create systems that draw things
on the screen and I was well I just
learned to make things that look nice
but I want to bring these projects these
are just workers didn&#39;t realize these
projects so don&#39;t this is really just a
Photoshop collage but I want to bring
this art in the world and I want to
bring these kind of works to make people
enable them to experience them so this
is one of the things I want to do the
second thing I want to do in the future
is to create this to use this input and
output pattern to create tools that
people can use to sketch their own
project ideas because I think this is
very powerful it can really change the
way people work with creative coding so
thank you very much
