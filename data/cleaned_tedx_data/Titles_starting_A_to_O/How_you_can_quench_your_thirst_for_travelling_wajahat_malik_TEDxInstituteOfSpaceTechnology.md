Oklahoma campuses na+ do it otherwise
it&#39;s a pleasure to be here
I got a call from one of your organizers
a while ago saying is he out now clear
TEDx talk gala and you have to deliver a
lecture or whatever another study cow
I come I like to speak not about myself
but about things that I do things that
are dear to my heart but for the life of
me I no idea what their exes and then
associating with one of your students
who is keeping me company and I said
yeah he had no idea what I&#39;m going to
say today so he said he motivates will
and not a motivational speaker you know
for me I say it is right so they stood
here I don&#39;t like talking about myself
you&#39;ve got fear production I will speak
a little about things that are closer to
my heart things that I would like to
share with you because I&#39;ll tell you let
me be very honest witness that let us
know ourselves that we are going to make
up times you know inside the dark ages
especially in our societies so for us as
well the owners are Diego artists ago
who say and so I think it&#39;s time that we
should do a bit of soul-searching and
get to know ourselves in our society now
place it was you with a really
interesting adventure story from my life
dig it so okay now I went to college in
the States and I was a young dreamer I
belong and once said you know I grew up
in the mountains when it was we called
Birdman
I was always sick of that place in a
wannabe runway because Mancera about the
piece a little belly up it was really
beautiful mountains but here it is to
get sick of them love mom like like them
so when I went to the states and I got
my degree in business management
I was not interested in business
management you know it&#39;s just that by
accident when I was like who would even
consider it a up whatever become movie
to manicotti I look like you become a
wise man no say that what will become
cause you have so many questions yet
Meccano very short of it&#39;s all right or
business management partner is right
agree completely
- Oh Chuck go to bar many charts are you
were maybe even a key whose payable
converter is so according to become a
wise man rocky already can be my
cameraman and then we can write the bus
and cross the border
nobody will know and we sat in the bus
and thought people would even know and
throw that bus started from the market
essentially
and other way shipped off script because
other we should support is 50 kilometers
so that is the sort of the last check
point so when we crossed Alaska
disability check for suspect they will
stop the bus so all the volunteers would
go if TR Saddam had a know you to scream
and you also so this is great because
you leave a like Java relations cross
that TV but I think four kilometers from
the main water it is disability check
post the bus stop and you will end up
ter Saddam and then these two guys down
because you guys are they like you too
you do and then they get out so so
teacher that is out easy like this be
done so they take us to whenever the
checkpost time so they take us to this
military training that you get with them
we have first a possible and they said
you be here before and now we try to
cross the border we need your passports
and sit down and they would really add
me so we sat down you know say and
they&#39;re like you look funny
this is anyway Kesava Bharati passport
they come on Amy
but snotty passport Kazakhstan blurb of
the precious pina colada this passport
is not valid for Israel right
oh you are these religions because you
treat to Israel and I&#39;m like do you
understand English
it does not say Israeli visa it says
it&#39;s not correct which way is no no no
but you are an Israeli agent 42 days ago
filming our air bases and now you here
again man I was on the road I didn&#39;t
know there was any way so I was just
doing my job
anyway he was very angry and he said we
know what you&#39;re doing and we know
trying to cross the border and all that
and we were detained for like almost
half a day and you were really scared
this time because these guys
business they said we&#39;ve got you up and
you don&#39;t make a move early anyway after
like a few hours they let us go and
they&#39;re like okay now you head back to a
month and we got our way this is
desperate give the word F is no can you
drop us back well we should live like no
so we were like literally witness can
you like with our bags standing in the
desert you know wondering what will
happen and then after a while talking to
the mom and it said I don&#39;t want to see
your face without this reason anymore
and I knew what he meant
so when I went back and what do I want I
had formed my office and say look this
is what&#39;s happening so the wall for me
is over so what should I do now when
they say well how much money do you have
I said I have enough people in fact I&#39;ve
never seen and so that&#39;s what I did I
went to Petra and hung out and they went
in there see - and you didn&#39;t drown it
was beautiful
that&#39;s how my story ended this is so
anyway I hope you got certain motivation
from my story
and all I can say is just be yourself do
not conform education the exam about
love you
so under and what you&#39;ve learned and
