today we&#39;re going to talk about
post-traumatic stress and how it&#39;s
affecting our veterans in the military
on 9/11 2001 America witnessed in horror
and shock of a heinous act of terror
brought upon our nation it was our big
city New York City at Washington DC but
it could have been Jacksonville because
affected all Americans
one thing we knew we were at war 16
years later were still at war 6,000
however all voluntary forced military
have been killed in action over 1
million of our kids and I call them kids
because I&#39;m older and I&#39;m a mom and I&#39;m
a grandma but our kids over 1 million
have been disabled and can no longer
function in the military half of that
number suffers from post-traumatic
stress what is post-traumatic stress
post-traumatic stress is trauma severe
trauma now any of you and maybe some of
you have suffered trauma severe trauma
maybe a car wreck a horrific car wreck
maybe a fire maybe a rape but generally
speaking that&#39;s a one-time event and
you&#39;ll never forget it but in the case
of the military and our multiple
deployments today because the 16 years
of war we&#39;re seeing trauma over and over
and over again so what they experienced
one day they go right back out and
experience it the next until the next
day becomes months and months become
years of deployments one of the symptoms
of post-traumatic stress anxiety
depression night terrors terrible night
terrors they call them the demons that
come to them in the night panic attacks
survivor&#39;s guilt
anger and in my opinion isolation is the
worst they can no longer go back to what
they did
they can no longer go back and be part
of their unit actually they can no
longer go back to war they can&#39;t even
get a job because of the repetitive
trauma it has basically broken them and
this disability is invisible you don&#39;t
see it so maybe somebody you in the
audience in fact I know of one that does
suffer from post-traumatic stress he
looks like everybody else you wouldn&#39;t
know it but believe me it&#39;s a deadly
disease we&#39;re losing unfortunately 20 to
22 veterans a day due to suicide I&#39;m
gonna repeat that 20 to 22 veterans a
day to suicide that&#39;s unacceptable what
are we doing to change it my own son did
two deployments in Iraq he was a k-9
police officer from Ohio a bomb dog
specialist at the time when the war
broke out in Iraq they needed bomb dog
handlers so he volunteered to go to Iraq
as a bomb dog specialist and he did two
tours there and as a police officer a
trained police officer I thought he was
prepared for almost anything I was I was
truly wrong he came home and I was so
thrilled to have him home but he was not
the same he was gone he was lost in the
abyss of war he was suffering from
post-traumatic stress in my day they
called it shell shock from the Vietnam
War today it&#39;s post-traumatic stress
post-traumatic stress is a disability
it&#39;s recognized under the ADEA it&#39;s
recognized under the Department of
Justice and most importantly it&#39;s
recognized in the VA so I did a lot of
research on how can I help my son how
can I help other veterans suffering from
this the
imitated deadly disability I came up
with one article a small article where
one company out in California was having
some success with service dogs to help
mitigate the symptoms of this disability
and of course that hit me because my son
was a dog trainer and a dog handler so I
approached him it really was the last
resort
what can I do to help him we had tried
therapy we had tried medication he began
drinking it was getting worse not better
he could no longer go back to work as a
police officer he couldn&#39;t function he
isolated from his family his child his
mom so I approached him on the idea why
don&#39;t we start a nonprofit that would
provide service dogs trained service
dogs to these veterans that are
suffering like you and as a trainer I
saw the light come on for the first time
I knew there was still a spark of hope
inside of him so seven years ago that&#39;s
when canines for warriors was born we
began a program we didn&#39;t know how to
start a non-profit we had no idea where
we were going to get the money a
facility the dogs but we worked hard as
a family and we got the dogs from the
shelter&#39;s because those dogs are
suffering an own post-traumatic stress
so we began our program and I knew that
giving a servicemen a dog was not the
only answer we had to change their
thinking we had to get them to leave the
war behind them and move forward in life
with dignity and independence so fast
forward seven years later we&#39;re now in a
beautiful 30,000 square foot facility in
knockety Florida we have kennels for a
hundred and twenty dogs that are being
trained 365 days a year we bring our
veterans in
they&#39;re all have suicidal thoughts all
are broken but we bring them in for a
three-week program where we honor them
we respect them and we give a purpose to
live again now their dog is a tremendous
part of that so you might ask what does
the service dog do well that dog is a
prescription on four legs that dog is
saving their lives we pull all of our
dogs from shelter but I&#39;m gonna say 95%
of them are pulled for shelter owners
surrender we have a puppy program I know
you all want to see my puppies so our
dogs are trained for months and months
and months service dogs have full public
access these are not emotional support
dogs they&#39;re not pets they&#39;re not lap
dogs in place they&#39;re not allowed as a
sterile environment say an operating
room that makes sense we rescue dogs
from all over the United States we have
actually rescued almost 800 dogs by the
end of the year 400 of them will become
fully certified as a service dog what
did we do with the other 400 they did
not go back to the shelter they&#39;ve all
found loving homes the dogs are trained
in specific skill sets stay down come
heal we&#39;d all be grateful if our dogs
did that right that&#39;s a major step right
there but we take the dogs further than
that for a veteran they do not like
anybody in their space particularly
someone who&#39;s been through so much
combat they don&#39;t know what to see or
what&#39;s coming up on them the flashbacks
come back they&#39;ll see things that we
don&#39;t see someone with a backpack
someone approaching them with something
in their side pocket it could be a bomb
so if someone were to come up fast on to
the veteran that dog gives a nice gentle
barrier between he and that
in person it&#39;s safety many of our
veterans have been shot they&#39;ve lost a
leg they&#39;ve been injured they all carry
90 to 120 pounds of equipment every day
out in the desert so the dogs are taught
brace so that they can get up and down
out of a seated position or up on the
floor this is my favorite
it&#39;s called cover none of the warriors
like anybody approaching them from the
rear and the military when they go out
on their maneuvers deployments they will
say he&#39;s my battle buddy no man left
behind and I&#39;ve got your six got your
six is exactly what cover is that dog
has the veteran six it&#39;s his eyes his
smell his ears he&#39;s watching out for his
veteran just because the war is over in
Iraq and Afghanistan and the veterans
mind that war is right here right now
now we do service dogs work by the end
of the year we&#39;ll have graduated almost
400 teams we&#39;ve had a 99% success rate
why do I say 99% tragically we lost one
female veteran to suicide but our
mission is to prevent suicide because
every warrior we&#39;ve seen as suicidal
tendencies we partnered with Purdue
University in the National Institute of
Health so that we could have medical
proof of why these dogs are working and
why they&#39;re saving lives the results
have been far more than we could have
dreamed up but the results are coming
out 85% reduction in panic attacks and
anxiety 77 production in night terrors
the big one that I&#39;d like to point out
is 82 percent decrease in suicidal
thoughts as I said anyone suffering from
war trauma post-traumatic stress has
suicidal thoughts
I would like to share with you briefly
three stories of veterans and I could
give you hundreds john mater MARSOC
Marine Special Forces one of the best
snipers in our military john was shot
nine times on three different occasions
three different appointments three
different times he was shot nine times
three purple hearts that&#39;s not what took
him out of the military post-traumatic
stress did he could no longer do his job
but he had to retire he came home he
felt like a failure as the last result
he came to k-9s for warriors and we
placed him with Sir Winston he doesn&#39;t
call him sir I do
today John owns three martial arts
studios they&#39;ve had two more children
and he&#39;s an advocate for service dogs
for veterans suffering like he did Alex
entered the army young kind of didn&#39;t
really know what he was getting into got
deployed on his third deployment he was
outside the Green Zone and Baghdad he
was in a vehicle called an MRAP this is
what an MRAP looks like sort of like a
Humvee his gunnery sergeant was training
him to go out in this MRAP and there was
an overpass and he said Alex when we get
to that overpass I want you to swerve
the MRAP back and forth because the
insurgents would drop bombs on him Alex
did what he was told the next thing he
knew his gunnery sergeants head was
severed at the neck there was a thin
wire unbeknownst to our military that
decapitated the gunnery sergeant that&#39;s
not something you can unsee that&#39;s not
something you can never forget we placed
Alex one of my favorite dogs skip it was
a rescued Labradoodle
today alex is married his two amazing
children and he and skipper going back
to school and he&#39;ll graduate next year
and finally Melissa when she came to US
Army she was so badly broken
she had isolated from her family she
couldn&#39;t engage with her children she
and her husband were ready to break up
she never left the house
but worst she stuttered so badly that
when she came to us I couldn&#39;t even
understand her she couldn&#39;t get her own
name out so he paired her with Chauncey
a beautiful rescue golden and in two
weeks
Melissa was speaking normally she was so
elated her children were elated she was
able to call them on the phone and say I
love you today they&#39;ve graduated college
Chauncey actually did a little better in
school than she did no surprise we have
excellent dog trainers but melissa has
graduated with honors at college so did
Chauncey they march down the aisle
together and she&#39;s now has an amazing
life thanks to her dog since the
military is an all voluntary force and
they&#39;re going through multiple
deployments 16 years and we&#39;re seeing 22
22 suicides a day and it&#39;s as I recap
post-traumatic stress as a result of
trauma
what is the VA doing about this
well intense therapy works for some but
it&#39;s not working well enough what&#39;s the
next thing they do they give them
prescriptions when that fails they give
them more prescriptions and when all
else fails let&#39;s give them a few more
prescriptions the average we see is 14 a
day
I had one warrior on 44 medications
today and he&#39;d never been shot so the
military teaches them how to go to war
but tragically because of the multiple
Wars these kids are not being taught how
to come home so our mission is to save
their life our mission is to get them
back into civilian life with dignity and
independence they deserve that but more
has to be done more agencies need to
follow our pact they need to follow our
lead and save more lives of our nation&#39;s
greatest asset our military but back to
my son who I so worried would be one of
those 22 he&#39;s now president of canines
for warriors he has helped trained over
400 dogs he has helped saved over 400
lives I&#39;d like you to meet Brett and his
service dog Reagan Brett
