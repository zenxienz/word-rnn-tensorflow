good evening my name is Pat Wallace and
I&#39;m the principal at Wright City West
elementary school on the right City
School District I&#39;m also a proud
Lindenwood alumni and I just want to
start by taking a second to thank you
I&#39;ve really enjoyed participating in
this great event and as I look out into
the audience and I see all the other
great speakers and presenters I just
think to myself wow look at all these
zeros oops
uh-huh you see this is my first TEDx
talk and the biggest piece of advice I
got as I was preparing was whatever you
do don&#39;t insult your audience so let me
try that again
what I meant to say was you all have the
potential to be zeros there that&#39;s a
little better okay let me explain you
see in our society today there&#39;s a
negative connotation around the
expression your zero currently it holds
the meaning that you&#39;re nothing a loser
worthless or worse even in the
merriam-webster dictionary the fourth
definition of zero is listed as an
insignificant person or a thing however
I&#39;m here to tell you today that that&#39;s
incorrect I am a zero and I&#39;m proud of
it and when I stated earlier you all had
the potential to be zeroes I meant it
and you should strive to be one so
here&#39;s how you can be being a zero is
simple there&#39;s only one question you
must pass on the test and remember I&#39;m
an educator we love our assessments that
question though is the one question you
must answer every single day when you
wake up in the morning and it is how
many people can I live with not helping
today let me repeat that how many people
can I live with not helping today all
you have to do is answer that question
with zero that&#39;s it
then you&#39;re a zero and I can guarantee
the dictionary has it wrong and you will
not be an insignificant person or thing
I have proof
you see I&#39;m standing here before you
today as the product of many zeroes
impact I grew up in a lower-income home
my father walked out on my family when I
was very
has not been around since my mother
worked a minimum of two jobs many times
three to help provide for my family
faced with much adversity I was blessed
to have so many zeroes enter my life
many of my male teachers and coaches who
became my role models were zeros and
they went above and beyond to provide
support and guidance to me they are the
reason I got into education in the first
place because I knew I was lucky that I
had these heroes in my life however not
every child or person is lucky enough to
have zeros in there&#39;s the negative
statistics we hear about children coming
from broken homes and poverty still
exist and I wanted to do something about
it I didn&#39;t want it to be left up to
luck if children had people in their
lives that would help them I knew I
wanted to dedicate my life to being
somebody else&#39;s zero now let&#39;s imagine
those same people we&#39;re number one
what if instead of answering the
question of how many people can I live
with not helping today with zero
they said one they could have thought to
themselves I can live with not helping
one person that&#39;s not so many
but what if I was that one how many ones
do you think comprise those terrible
statistics how many people missed out on
a chance to be something because they
didn&#39;t have a zero in their lives then
think what if people answer that
question with two three or four what is
that number for you how many people can
you really live with not helping in any
given day ask yourself in my view
there&#39;s only one acceptable answer to
that question zero so that&#39;s why I&#39;m
here it&#39;s simple I want to convince you
all to be zeros because it is my
contention that it isn&#39;t being a zero
that makes you an insignificant person
or thing it&#39;s not being one one final
note in addition to defining zero as an
insignificant person or thing the very
first definition the dictionary gives
zero is the absence of all magnitude or
quantity however is my belief that if
each of us becomes zeros we can make a
difference in this world whose magnitude
and quantity is not absent but is
instead
profoundly immeasurable so I challenge
you each of you be zeros and maybe just
maybe like this events great theme we
can truly rise up and change the world
thank you
[Applause]
