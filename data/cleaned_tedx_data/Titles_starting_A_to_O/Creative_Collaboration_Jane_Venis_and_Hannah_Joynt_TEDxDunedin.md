well that was different it was to be
always different
indeed it is it&#39;s different every time
yeah I I really actually this time I
really liked the part where you dropped
away the peel and went straight back to
just the guitar I felt there was a lot
of space in there and I could engage
with it and it gave me a space to draw
yeah they both understand I thought it
was being too busy and I thought that&#39;s
like having a conversation you think our
God and Saint Chalmers just shut up so
you know I decided to drop back and then
I kind of reengage with you it yeah it&#39;s
always different
indeed um it&#39;s like we are having a
conversation but we&#39;re using different
languages your language is music my
language is drawing and in my language
I&#39;ve got lines and dots and flex and
there&#39;s that that wiggly line love the
wiggly line I&#39;m right on that wiggly
line I know
and in this color as well and sometimes
sometimes I see a color when I&#39;m hearing
the sound and sometimes it just looks
really yellow I think in that one there
was definitely like these speckles of
orange I could hear them but other times
it it&#39;s it&#39;s multi-sensory and sometimes
I can kind of get a taste and I think oh
well that tastes a little bit leafy I&#39;m
just gonna I&#39;m gonna do that
so hurry it&#39;s a worry yeah I know I mean
it&#39;s um it&#39;s not like it&#39;s just one
language because for me there&#39;s a
language of architecture going on as
well really it could yeah well I penny
the layers are happening here you&#39;re
building things up with layers I am
building things up with layers and it
seems to me this kind of like
architectural space happening here with
us both is creating an atmosphere I know
what you mean about the atmosphere I
think I build an atmosphere by sometimes
really notating what you&#39;re playing I&#39;m
making my
max are in a rhythmical way and yeah
like I&#39;m writing your music but other
times I kind of stand back and I realize
I&#39;m drawing a picture and I&#39;m working in
a rectangle and there&#39;s a composition
going on and so there&#39;s a kind of like
several approaches to building that
atmosphere hmm
you&#39;re absolutely right and I think when
you&#39;re talking about a vocabulary before
you&#39;ve got your flicks and your
splatters and your wiggly line I&#39;ve got
a vocabulary too and for me it starts
with laying down picks a rhythm section
and then some bass over the top and it&#39;s
like having a field to play on so
there&#39;s this field and you just kind of
wander out and to it and have fun but in
that field there&#39;s also things you can
do and for me it&#39;s like you know funky
little bass lips or funky little kind of
guitar licks or just stepping back and
just coloring something just with a
couple of little notes
that&#39;s very faintly of you gentle very
yeah very um but you know every time we
do this and we do this I on a regular
basis we have we&#39;re having jams and
that&#39;s what we call it
it&#39;s improvisation and every time we do
it it comes out the front and I&#39;m making
marks and I&#39;m drawing in a way that I
wouldn&#39;t normally get to drawing like
that just on my own so that is the power
of of working with Jayne in this
collaboration it is it is a clever
process and both drawing in musica
improvisational you know you&#39;ve got a
home base to go to but then you can
range out from their base and in wood
together so that&#39;s how we make a
difference isn&#39;t that inner and making a
difference for us is making a difference
in a moment yeah in the moment thank you
thanks thank you hello Ricky Jay
