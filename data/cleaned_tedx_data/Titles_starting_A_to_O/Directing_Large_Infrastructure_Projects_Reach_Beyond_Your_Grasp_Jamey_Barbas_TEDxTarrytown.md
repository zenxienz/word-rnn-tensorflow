I&#39;ve been the bridge engineer for over
thirty years
designer and director of large
infrastructure projects currently I&#39;m
the project director for the governor
Mario Cuomo bridge which replayed this
thank you I gather you know it every
replaces the Tappan Zee Bridge over the
beautiful Hudson River in New York this
four billion dollar transportation
project is one of the largest in the
United States certainly the largest in
New York and in order to give a sense of
scale for those who have not seen it
firsthand I&#39;d like to show a quick video

well I&#39;m often asked how did you end up
becoming an engineer I guess I don&#39;t
look like a typical engineer and what
does it take to lead these mega projects
well for me it started here that&#39;s a
four year old my dad used to take me to
the park pretty much to get out of my
mom&#39;s hair with the baby brother and he
let me climb these tall pine trees as
high as I wanted and that actually
served a couple of good things he used
to tell me that I could be anything I
wanted as long as I you know worked hard
reach beyond your grasp and don&#39;t settle
for the easy path and as a four-year-old
that analogy was ok because I could
understand that with the tree branches
and it was important because in the mid
60s there were not a lot of female role
models in the workforce so having your
father say it meant it could be true I
would say that when I became a teenager
I started in a really great liberal arts
school in New York City and I knew like
my classmates that I really wanted to
pick a career that would be a positive
contribution to society at least most of
my classmates something that would have
really meaningful in the work and I
started as pre-med and a couple years
into my college I saw a course in the
curriculum called biomedical engineering
that was offered across the street at
the engineering school well actually way
across campus and I decided to take it I
had not even known an engineer never met
one had no clue what engineers did when
I started to take this class in the
engineering school I found out what
engineers really did do they actually
use math and science and apply it to
solve real-world problems how cool is
that so I applied to the engineering
school still finished up my liberal arts
degree and started
working and my first year of engineering
school I found it a little challenging
to be honest I didn&#39;t have the technical
background coming from the liberal arts
program that lot of the classmates did
they all came from technical high
schools so my first year in engineering
school I used to sit in my desk doing my
homework with stacks of textbooks around
me trying to catch up and you know learn
the solutions to my homework problems I
made it through it got better after the
first year but I graduated started a
structural engineer in a Highway
Transportation bridge and building
design company and during my first year
at work I still was in the habit of
having my textbooks on my desk and
looking up you know the solutions to the
problems and my immediate supervisor
took this as initiative and lucky for me
because he went to the firm&#39;s partners
and said look at that girl she worked so
hard
why don&#39;t we promote her to a project
manager of a small bridge let her do it
and the partners looked at him as if he
was crazy and they said no she&#39;s way too
young and we&#39;ve never had a woman
project manager before so what are you
thinking so a week later my supervisor
went back to the firm&#39;s partners and he
said how about this let her be the
project manager of this small bridge
would be really good for her to learn
everything about a bridge from the
beginning to the end even though it&#39;s
small and I&#39;ll check in with her from
time to time and this is all the money
you&#39;re gonna save because she&#39;s running
the job full-time and I&#39;m not and the
partner said yes so I really had that
first boss to thank for really trying to
give me an opportunity I went on to more
challenges bigger bridges more complex
structures this is the Bear Mountain
bridge actually I was the design manager
the project manager for some of the
reconstruction work and so I always
raised my hand for the more complex
projects again reaching beyond your
grasp
you know rising up to challenges so I
would say a couple of important things
if you want to manage big projects is to
first really know your subject matter be
an expert at something and the second is
to not be afraid of daunting assignments
of risks challenges you&#39;re only going to
excel if you really put your mind to it
so definitely the echo of reach beyond
your grasp was with me an even more
challenging project was adding a lower
level to this suspension bridge in
Lisbon Portugal now this bridge was the
longest bridge in the world when it was
built in the early 60s by a famous
bridge designer called David Steinman
thirty years later the Portuguese
transportation officials pick up the
telephone and luckily I was working for
the eponymous Steinman bridge design
company and they said can you add that
lower level that we want we&#39;re talking
about thirty years ago and of course we
said yes we will do that but it wasn&#39;t
so easy in fact there had not been
suspension bridge building for 30 years
the less was the Verrazano and there was
not a lot of transfer of knowledge in
that generation because nobody was
really building them so I was the design
I represented the designer for the
construction phase of this project and I
had to rely on one of the firm partners
who was very very elderly and in the
hospital and although he was you know
physically not doing well his mind was
still sharp and he was around for the
first suspension bridge building and he
would fax me from his hospital bed
sketches and details that I would then
take with this flimsy fax paper go on
the airplane and then go to Portugal and
explain to the builders how things
should be now spinning cables that were
added to the suspension bridge is
quite a difficult thing to do it&#39;s not
and cables by the way I&#39;m making made up
of thousands of wires probably the
diameter of a pencil so each one of
those big cables that you see that go
like this that actually has to get spun
from shore to shore almost like a bobbin
and a spool and a sewing machine each
wire is dragged pulled across the river
another one picked up and brought back
to the other side of the shore again and
again could imagine thousands of times
and then all that cable is compacted so
it looks like it looks like a pipe but
it&#39;s not it&#39;s really thousands of
strands of wire and it all gets pulled
down into bedrock and anchored also the
vertical ropes had to come down between
the existing vertical ropes and go catch
the lower level that we were adding for
railroad so they asked us to put a
railroad on because the bridge was so
congested it was basically a 24 hour day
rush hour and they said well you make
the lower level for railroad can you
also widen the bridge a little bit for
us why not so it and it&#39;s not just
putting extra cables to pick up the
heavyweight of the railroad we had to
actually lift the bridge up and then put
it back down so both cables were sharing
in the right proportion of load which
was very tricky I don&#39;t know if it was
ever done before but we successfully did
it thanks to the old guy who was helping
me
now I mentioned that there are a couple
of important things to learn to be or do
to manage these big projects one was
really knowing your subject matter
deeply to taking challenges and risks in
your work but the third one which is
actually just as important if not more
is the ability to take your team and get
them all aligned to the same goal and
that&#39;s often where a lot of peers kind
of fail because you&#39;re dealing with
humans you&#39;re dealing with hundreds of
people on projects like this and not
everybody has the same agenda and you
have to convince them that although
personally you may not be liking my
decision you have to cooperate in
collaborate because we&#39;re all reaching
for the same goal at the end so the the
most effective leaders are ones that can
convey that vision that motivation and
it&#39;s usually ones that have passion that
think they can change the world and do a
little bit better even if it&#39;s just
making a public works project because if
you believe it your team will too a lot
of my colleagues really have the passion
for what they&#39;re doing and they like to
cast a wide reach to help other people
because they do believe they&#39;re changing
the world for the better in little bits
I belong to a foundation a nonprofit
called bridges to prosperity and in this
organization we go to places in the
world that communities are suffering
from rural isolation basically these
rivers flood maybe for months or more
out of the year and what looks low-lying
here becomes a rage very dangerous River
that children can&#39;t go to school people
can&#39;t get health care across the other
side of the river without actually
risking their life and some do die or
even bringing their goods to market for
four months of the year so by building a
footbridge and I have colleagues who are
contractors engineers and a lot of
university students who volunteer for
these builds to help and actually when
everyone&#39;s pulling in the right
direction
the teamwork what you get can be amazing
so here the locals with contractors
engineers students are pulling to create
this bridge we go to areas in South
America Central America Africa India the
ones most cut off from the communities
on the other side of the river and they
use local materials obviously the cables
are donated by some contractors or some
ports that don&#39;t need to use so much
cable but all the other materials the
locals learn how to do it they help
build so the concrete or the wood planks
that come from the wooded area so that
they can they learn actually some trades
and they also learn how to fix their own
bridges do you ever see children so
happy to go to school so right here at
home in New York near the bridge we have
a really great outreach program we have
a number of people on our staff who&#39;ve
already touched fifty thousand students
teaching them science technology
engineering art and math all through the
project demonstrations it&#39;s a really
fantastic program children of all ages
even seniors and other people but using
the bridge as an example so the children
are aware that there are professions
like this because we really do need boys
and girls to get into engineering to
continue to fuel American innovation we
desperately need more engineering
students and it&#39;s really great for the
girls to see your role model my role
model in the Tagus bridge when I was
going on that airplane was actually
Emily Roebling you know I knew she went
with her directions from her ailing
husband to the bridge site and I would
think how courageous was she to have
done that at the time she did it so when
I was a little bit nervous about taking
those details from my ailing mentor and
going to Portugal I thought of her and
that was my role model here the girls
get to see
somebody a little bit more in their
century now I&#39;d like to ask you whatever
it is your skills talents hobbies try to
reach out and share it try to teach the
next generation what you know because
you never know who you may inspire
someday to reach beyond her grasp thank
you
[Applause]
