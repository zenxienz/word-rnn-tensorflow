don&#39;t ever let somebody tell you you
can&#39;t do something you got a dream you
gotta protect it people can&#39;t do
something themselves they want to tell
you you can&#39;t do it you want something
go get it period I don&#39;t know what that
dream is that you have I don&#39;t care how
disappointing it might have been as
you&#39;ve been working toward that dream
but that dream that you&#39;re holding in
your mind that it&#39;s possible it&#39;s
possible I walk a lonely road the only
one that I have ever known don&#39;t know
where it goes but it&#39;s home to me and I
walk along about being rational it&#39;s
about following your heart I walk this
empty street on the Boulevard of broken
dreams when the city sleeps and I&#39;m the
only one and I walk alone these antique
gentlemen are watching around the world

there is something I believe every
person has to have if you&#39;re going to
achieve their dreams and I believe it&#39;s
summed up in one word anyway that what
it is don&#39;t know who you&#39;re talking to
someone we clue you in
[Music]
never
[Music]
denied
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
it was my dream
it was my goal I don&#39;t expect you to do
I don&#39;t expect you to believe in my
dream like I believe in my dream and the
problem with some of y&#39;all is you want
some lies to support your dream yours
don&#39;t ever let somebody tell you you
can&#39;t do something
[Applause]
