I&#39;m gonna start by taking you back about
300 years about 300 years ago there were
no such things as offices there were no
factories if you worked you probably
work near home you probably worked on
the land or if you manufactured you did
it in your house at the cottage
industries work was judged by what you
produced it wasn&#39;t judged by how many
hours you were actually at work but in
1729 the East India Company opened the
first ever office in Leadenhall Street
in London the first Factory wasn&#39;t open
until 1769 we then have the Industrial
Revolution no more offices more
factories and it became a way of working
that we all commuted to work and that&#39;s
the way we still work today but have you
asked yourself recently is that a
productive way of working does it suit
businesses does it suit society I&#39;m
going to argue that it doesn&#39;t this is
what happens every morning around the
world we all fight with the trains the
roads are congested we&#39;re dipping out
pollution all over the place and then we
get to the office and what happens at
the office Bob wants you to tell you how
to his job again because he can&#39;t be
bothered to find out for himself and
you&#39;re sat there so it&#39;s very easy Mary
wants to tell you all about what she and
Peter got up to at the party at the
weekend and Beryl wants to foist yet
more baked goods on you but the office
is actually a terrible place to work
it&#39;s full of distractions it is really
tough I find it difficult to understand
anyone can work from an office so most
of us have our best ideas either in the
bath or walking in the woods
you&#39;re glad I didn&#39;t pitch with the bath
I think up there every choice and it&#39;s
because we&#39;re away from all those
distractions and we&#39;re stress free now
just as just as an industrial revolution
happened there&#39;s a revolution happening
now that&#39;s just starting but it&#39;s
beginning to get traction we&#39;re calling
in the agile revolution the agile
revolution means instead of thinking
about where you work how you work who
you work for you break down all those
barriers and you just focus on what you
deliver it started as a way of project
managing in the on IT industry but it&#39;s
now spread a lot further than that and
everyone&#39;s starting to think about it
but very few people understand it which
is why we wrote the book the idea
revolution if you think about it most of
us are working in an agile way now you
know you&#39;re sending emails in the
evening some of you maybe even working
now as I&#39;m speaking since a smartphone
came about we&#39;ve all been working in an
agile way you know it&#39;s become the norm
but we&#39;re not all doing it at work so
let me persuade you as to why it&#39;s wrong
the society first of all if you think
about what&#39;s happening in society at the
moment let&#39;s start by transport as I
said the government is spending billions
and billions of pounds every year on
improving the trains the road networks
generally on infrastructure billions of
pounds and yet the roads are still
crowded the trains are still congested
we still have to fight the strikes and
then you look at the cost of it the
average cost of a commute is 168 pounds
a month that equates to around about 21%
of a mortgage payment the average time
someone commutes a day is an hour and 38
minutes in some parts of the country
it&#39;s gone up to four hours a day out of
your working day and of course it is
exhausting you then look at pollution
pollution in this country there&#39;s an
annual limit of pollution set by the
World Health Organization in this year
we reach that annual limit in London but
6th of January that&#39;s before most of us
even got back from Christmas holiday
it&#39;s Twelfth Night that&#39;s when the
pollution limit was reached you then
look at housing costs there is a huge
disparity in housing costs across the UK
this is caused by the fact people need
to be near their jobs the either need to
be near their jobs or they have to
commute and most of
manage a reluctant balance of both but
housing costs much more expensive if
you&#39;re near your job or if there&#39;s a lot
of jobs nearby it means that in fondling
you can buy a one-bedroom flat for
fourteen and a half thousand pounds
I suspect you can&#39;t get a garage in
working for fourteen and a half thousand
pounds and in the center of London it&#39;s
gone up sue million this means we&#39;ve got
a whole generation of people who the
idea of a front door their own front
door is an unrealistic dream it&#39;s not
going to happen it&#39;s never gonna happen
you then look at society and communities
and we&#39;ve all seen problems with mental
health etc all the studies show that
people benefit by knowing the people
around them their community and being
part of a community and yet almost no
one knows their next-door neighbor at
all
it&#39;s because we live and work in
different places a lot of towns are now
dormitory towns you sleep there and you
go to work somewhere else you don&#39;t know
anyone at all and then on to the final
point as I said I&#39;ve over these quite
quickly obviously but they&#39;re all huge
issues by themselves the next point is
women child care elder care women are
now in the workforce that means there is
a little bit of a hole at home who looks
after the children who looks after older
people with agile working it&#39;s not so
much of an issue be sure not so far from
home childcare is a cost that most of us
can&#39;t afford it is ridiculous cost
trying to put your older folk into homes
is a ridiculous cost but actually if
you&#39;re nearby if there is an accident
you&#39;re on hand and we then look at
people with disabilities we spoke a bit
about it it&#39;s but there&#39;s are a lot of
people at home who are highly skilled
but they can&#39;t work and they&#39;re
economically inactive simply because
they cannot travel which is a crazy
situation so they&#39;re on benefits etc so
there&#39;s a lot of very good reasons why
society it doesn&#39;t work the way we&#39;re
working currently but then is this a
burden on business as a business owner I
obviously don&#39;t want any extra burdens
on business we did a study earlier in
this year with a company called bps
world
bps world is a global recruiter there at
the very sharp end of the skills crisis
they recruit for things like an IT in
engineering where there&#39;s a real problem
the right people we asked agile
companies those are already introduced
agile working we ask them what the
impact was most of them said that the
productivity increase of introducing
agile working was between 10 and 20
percent
they also found there is much easier to
recruit people and it made life much
easier for them around
they also found people didn&#39;t leave as
often because they were more wedded to
the company more engaged with the
company
there were also bigger studies done in
China there was one with a company
called sit trip there are 20,000
employees they spent sent half of them
home to remote work it was done to try
and reduce overhead costs the other half
stayed working as we normally know it in
the office and they tracked them over 2
years at the end of the two years they
looked at what the impact was and again
they found a 13 percent productivity
increase and a 50% drop in resignations
so there&#39;s a huge productivity reason
for working like this the issue about
people leaving work as an employer I
already have people working for me who
left agencies and other places because
they wouldn&#39;t even allow them to work
one day from home now that is a huge
issue in a skills crisis we&#39;ve got at
the moment where it&#39;s really difficult
to get good people so the person I&#39;ve
employed she brought in million pound
contracts to her agency but they
wouldn&#39;t let her work from home one day
a week and as there are more more
companies like mine who are gonna
recruit people in this way and let them
work where they need to work obviously
I&#39;m gonna be I&#39;m in front queue as far
as the skills crisis is concerned so I&#39;m
very happy about that so you don&#39;t have
to look at why businesses aren&#39;t doing
this that&#39;s the main reason the main
reason people said to me business owners
of why they don&#39;t allow people to work
from home is the importance of informal
communication the water-cooler moment I
think informal communication is
incredibly important that&#39;s why we get
together one or two days a week there&#39;s
one or two days a week we compress all
our water-cooler moments into one or two
days we find out when Mark and Jenny got
up to at the party we do share baked
goods
and we gots it and it is social and we
do have lunch and we do all those things
and it&#39;s fun but I come away from it
again astonished that anyone can really
work for an office it is so full of
distractions the second thing is
presenteeism the need to be present you
have to be present in the office but
presenteeism is a very strange concept
in today&#39;s world how many people
actually judge Amazon has a less
credible retailer because they they&#39;re
not they don&#39;t have a shop and when you
buy insurance do you go online or do you
expect to go and see an insurance broker
in a nice shiny office presenteeism is
going the other big issue is that most
companies myself included even though
we&#39;re tiny we&#39;re a global company which
means that at any one time even if I
work I need to work 24 hours a day seven
days a week to make sure that moment
always presents when some of them might
need me so we&#39;re not present anyway we
really are not present it&#39;s really
important that we understand that people
are productive at different times of the
day if you see me first thing you&#39;ll see
that I talk really slowly and my brains
not working I&#39;m more productive later in
the day if we&#39;re having to accept
people&#39;s time clocks around the world
why not accept that they&#39;re actually
productive at different times of the day
as well it&#39;s a really important issue it
makes a massive difference as you can
see these are the reasons why
productivity increased so good overall
most companies are now at least
beginning to think about this there are
issues no doubt about them this doesn&#39;t
suit everyone or all companies or all
sectors I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to be
operated on remotely and obviously in
hospitality and things
it also doesn&#39;t suit all people what I&#39;m
suggesting is that you give people an
option and as I said you still need to
come together but people should have an
option at least you know why judge
people by how long are their sat at the
desk some people do get cabin fever at
home and that&#39;s why there&#39;s so many good
work ups and places now where you can go
to and be near home you don&#39;t have to
commute two hours you can just go down
the road and get to know your local
business community that&#39;s really
important training can be more difficult
but we took on a 22 year
work-experience person and yes we sat
with her in the office a couple of days
a week she came away from the experience
and said it was actually no different to
university that you sit together you
train you get to know the job and you go
away and work out with you can do it
yourself and it does great really
independent employees are very much
focused on the end goal I think as I
said most companies begin to think about
this I think a lot of them don&#39;t
understand it a lot of them are said
things to me like yes we&#39;re fully agile
company we allow people to go home early
on a Friday that&#39;s not an agile employer
and that&#39;s one of the reasons we wrote
the agile revolution with bps world the
global recruiter there is a huge issue I
think at the public sector policy level
I was at City Hall in October last month
and there&#39;s a big board there which
saying all the policy initiatives around
pollution they didn&#39;t mention agile
working but can you imagine the impact
if everyone just worked one or two days
from home a week the massive impact on
pollution one of the people who
contribution to the book was a guy
called Leon Benjamin Leon Benjamin is a
change management consultant he&#39;s worked
with people like virgin and BT and
Microsoft some really big players he was
sat down with Transport for London and
he said you&#39;ve got all these problems
you&#39;re throwing these billions of pounds
at hurt wouldn&#39;t it be better just to
encourage some agile working he was met
with a complete blank stare as if he was
mad so this is not even being thought
apparent people are not even thinking
that this could solve so many of
society&#39;s problems even if it doesn&#39;t
work for some everyone it could work for
a lot of people of course if the public
sector will probably get on board with
this at the point that their gains
critical momentum and a lot of people
are doing it if they&#39;re late to the
party doesn&#39;t really matter they won&#39;t
go out of business but I&#39;m saying if
businesses late to the party you will go
out of business the revolution will be
bloody thank you
