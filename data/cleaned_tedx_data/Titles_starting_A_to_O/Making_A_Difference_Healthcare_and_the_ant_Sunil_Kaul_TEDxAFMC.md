I&#39;m back here three years since I came
last but I think many of you like my
friends from our batch colluded and
brought me here for the HMRC
universit√§t scared
it&#39;s so comforting to be back in the
black of my mother and this is no hand
ohmmeter
I&#39;ve learned a lot from here and also
from Tommy and I think I think would be
complete without this journey so just
bear with me the next 15 minutes I don&#39;t
believe that whatever I&#39;m going to tell
you I&#39;ve done it alone because of my
sense and I call the mad friends because
they make a difference they have been
listening to their functions and working
with me I think the highest paid in my
organization today about thirty thousand
piece a month which probably is lesser
than what a soldier and how he gets but
yes also a rider that you know from you
know chop and now to holler for the who
talked about in the 2000 and we missed
the bus for help for all that health is
politics whether we like to talk about
it or keep mum about it that itself is a
political statement and I stand by it
so if I transgress the taped off thing
that you know I hate something political
about it no way but I just finished a
you can see and then join army Austin
after a great video and yesterday you
saw the latest edges you were so now you
are not a predation well I think the
emolia&#39;s pain a lot on my mind
I started asking myself what am i doing
actually had never been to a village
earlier thanks to the army I have seen
when I&#39;ve never seen
background but there when I was moving
around in Oaxaca then I realized what&#39;s
happening that you know the night that I
was leading was probably so so sheltered
oh my sadly inadequate I used to walk a
lot I challenged myself to be with the
infantry and I should walk faster than
them quicker than them and higher than
them most of the time and I used to land
up in places where there was forget
about education forget about medicine it
was not even clothing on people
there were places where people have not
even tasted sugar in that time well that
got me thinking and I pledge to myself
yes and house bickering to my friends to
go though my classmate he said daddy can
I have a coordination of captive or
hotel and it hurt me or not because I
had joined the Army in a very patriotic
spirit probably because my father was a
freedom fighter but meanwhile I
discovered some health work and
understand my whole idea of working in
whether this was probably their push
you know teach some children and
probably treat some patients and then
and they turned by the son he will get
you muga we sometimes you wanna go to
get married too because it&#39;d be nice to
them but I never thought that you know
you could do things for the larger
scheme public health kind of platform so
when I found this organization in
Rajasthan and I met a friend who was a
brilliant friend and he and I decided
then to move to the Northeast
so by doing all this I shifted with some
of these professional friends to the
Northeast
and we started some work in Missoula
which is the largest in average River
Island in the world and typically
because we were professionals I took on
the help
help started working with community
health workers trained them over the
books of Medicine generic medicines and
so that they could deliver healthcare
and treat most of the common illnesses
that you could think of in less than ten
rupees and and we proved it in just one
year because we were reaching out to
areas which were cut off from the flux
the first we are trying to go into those
ideas we can&#39;t realize that that&#39;s where
the militants used to hide and these are
it&#39;s seen a pattern to it and they
thought that we we are probably raw
agents Roy as a researcher glasses way
and probably were after them and they
kidnapped my senior colleague and as a
ransom we got asked to quit the place
not just the iron but the entire caucus
and televised it so that they could see
we went out and we learned later on that
this person had already been killed and
they were fooling us so some of us they
have to come back we decided that we are
not going to bow down to violence
especially because some of us had take
care of all criminal violence and he
spent that if we were to run away from
this path because of these people&#39;s work
we will be actually succumbing to ions
so some of us came back and two of us
started this journey in the end I have
pretty much did the same thing here as I
was doing earlier I saw or imagined but
one thing which I was doing there which
I learned from Rajasthan initially was
my PD work when I inserted one of the
native Shopko schema therapy treatments
they had but without the dots deny being
observed treatment we of course got
about 85 percent cure rates in it self
administered but what we realized was
though we were curing a lot of patients
the same villages continue to send new
regulations every year but those
villages in which we had started some
eating program or an income generation
program or any program is for drought
proof the economy the more patients have
stopped coming and that&#39;s where rather
if I think this convergence
whatever little we did I was making
headlines at that I was both of earlier
Department and the team in apartment
not because I was doing something great
but I was just doing something more than
ordinary trying to go deeper and deeper
into why something was happening and we
even from there we brought away good
quality papers at one time on the maybe
the society inside inside the indoor
water tanks of Rajasthan you know the
mosquito which was there which was
otherwise nobody knew why the malaria
had spread out there over there it was
on TV where we had already discovered 10
percent of MDR TB even back there 94 95
so I learned from that and started work
in Assam again but this time Moodle and
which was still in the throes of
militancy this was the year 2000 and
when we started there
I simply picked up what I had learned
there and I said instead of you know
starting a TB treatment by that time the
government had already come up with the
dots program was killing medicine I said
let me not concentrate on that but let&#39;s
learn from it
let&#39;s choose the poorest of the families
and because many of them already in the
Northeast move out to be we said also
because the fact that many of these
areas had so here also I was doing the
same thing but what we realize initially
was that when you are reaching out
because there was no health service at
all between this 50 barefoot doctor that
will pray who would give you antibiotics
and we have protocols worked out
beforehand your sub systems of managing
them we realize that what we miss out
there and we were losing around 300 for
it
money idea for Alma later but yes they
were never diagnosed as well because
there was nothing to prove it
so we also set up barefoot 17 laboratory
with against ended trade people and they
would be charging ten to fifteen rupees
or malaria swine but we have to be sure
that what they were doing was correct
and I said about 100 randomly selected
slides I said it the National malaria
research and I said hey it is check out
whether what they are doing is correct
ten days later had flown down to see
what was a training program like because
this was the first time they found 92%
species identification being typed only
one or two remembers how you see things
on a microscope I remember very well
that when our teacher would say oh look
at that you know I knew your proposition
and I couldn&#39;t see but if the person
before me said yes ma&#39;am I can see very
well I had no heart to say that I had
seen but what we used was technology we
used LCD projectors we used on this
thing and if anybody said well this is a
PV you asked you to get up and say why
is that you point out what they go to
the word of the characteristics and only
then was it very sure these people
within no time I got very very talented
but then 2005 we had the National Board
of Health Mission
coming up and we started reducing our
parallel systems we refused to create
more health workers and some of these
not still they are working some of them
are working is ahsha&#39;s but i&#39;m beneath
that a community health worker gets a
very good opportunity to enter a society
to give help what we feel that she
connects soup all the determinants of
health and there are agencies which are
required to look into the determinants
of health which have slightly outside
the realm of the health department we
started talking about the right to food
the Supreme Court had pass judgments on
how much company under the bodies have
to be there how much aggression people
are supposed to get all that was missing
from their with the result that we raise
our voice release
consciousness of people made a bit of
hahaha without doing any violence I mean
because that&#39;s one of our purposes that
we can&#39;t allow violence and very soon we
had when we were contributing to the
National Food Security Act has come out
today and we are very happy that things
have moved constitutionally otherwise
going to and I think I see that most of
our problems are not just because this
one a lot of the proposition there in us
this is one of lack of care for the
other which is wrong and I think a lot
of us need to look at that look at those
for our public health because I think
those are going to be the dangers of the
future violence is coming back into a
lot of thing I mean if you read the
papers whether it&#39;s you know journalist
being killed or whether it&#39;s a woman
being eaten at home and on a child who&#39;s
beaten by the father or the mother -
these are actually criminal acts because
even a father or mother or not suppose
to touch a child in the house this is a
criminal act but we allow it because
that&#39;s what we have seen you may not
know this in UK or in US or anywhere
else but in India we just do it with
impunity and because children are
exposed to violence
at their homes you have children growing
up understanding that any solution to
any problem is violence and I think
there if you need to move ahead we need
to make people understand how to solve a
problem with a good dialogue and that&#39;s
where we are working these days 2012
shook us because we had outbreak of
virus adenovirus in our area which we
had not really enforcing and from that
day we&#39;ve started a journey with
initiatives of change here in Parsippany
and through then I was very happy the
three months ago I brought the Milton
commander and the student union leader
both personally and I saw it so
beautiful when they pledged their tenets
of nature of the change which is
absolute honesty absolute purity
absolute unselfishness and absolutely
love when they place that I felt that my
journey in a sample is no longer
required because I think that&#39;s where I
think I should have moved and that&#39;s
what I always thought that we a long
term work would be able to influence
bringing back peace and reducing these
communal divides which has played for
nothing for a long time just like the
malaria engineers did at one time we
never thought of them as Public Enemies
workers but today I think we need
philosophers religious leaders all of
them to be seen as public health
specialists for us so that we prevent
Wars we prevent communal strikes we
prevent civil wars which are now
cleaning everywhere remember this that
whenever we as doctors or as help people
we talk of we look at mortality and
morbidity as disease or how the end of
disease and anything which causes death
and disease is our domain so if it&#39;s a
war if it&#39;s a communal killing if it&#39;s a
basically if it&#39;s any killing I think we
need to make
she&#39;s idea to wake them up and say
dialogue is the way forward
it&#39;s not about wireless and I think
that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be call ourselves the
act because we believe that adds another
Mach that others in throwing at us that
size doesn&#39;t matter for us others think
they are small but anion goes up and
lifts between 20 to 18 times its own
weight and
