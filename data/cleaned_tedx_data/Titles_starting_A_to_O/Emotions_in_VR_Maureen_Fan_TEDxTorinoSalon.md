do you all remember what you were like
when you were five years old and what
your dreams were when you thought that
anything was possible
but something happens when you get a
little older where you start to doubt
yourself and wonder if you can achieve
your dreams in some time Society can get
you to conform to values of Fame money
fortune and power but I believe that
there&#39;s still a dreamer inside all of us
and I know it&#39;s true because it&#39;s why we
go watch the movies and why we read
books today it&#39;s to experience stories
and people and characters that we can&#39;t
experience in our lives to stretch our
imaginations and to realize what our
true potential is and I believe that VR
animation can do this in a way that no
other previous medium has because
animation is not constrained by reality
animation is constrained only by the
creativity within the director&#39;s head
and VR puts you into that environment
and even lets you interact with the
other characters and I believe that VR
animation teaches us what it means to be
human brings out that dreamer inside of
us and helps us understand what the
human potential is so what was my dream
when I was a kid I wanted to be an
animator and so I went to Stanford
University where I designed my own major
in computer science art and psychology
but my mom and dad told me I&#39;d be very
poor and destitute if I followed my
dreams and entertainment so instead I
went to ebay where I started off as a UI
designer and then became a culture
anthropologist and then a product
manager of new ventures but nights and
weekends I took classes at the Community
College because all the Lucasfilm
animators would teach there and I
thought if I could just save up enough
money one day I can pursue my real dream
and go get an MFA and do animation so
five years had passed
I decided it&#39;s time I&#39;m going to apply
to get a master in fine arts but the
deadlines had passed and my mom said why
don&#39;t you just apply to business school
and I thought because I hate business
but I ended up applying because of a
good daughter and I got into Harvard
Business School and I was going to say
no and my boss at eBay said don&#39;t be an
idiot don&#39;t say no to Harvard without
first trying out Hollywood because it&#39;s
very sexy but you don&#39;t know what
Hollywood is actually about so I ended
up going to Hollywood and became
assistant to Zach Braff and Joseph
gordon-levitt&#39;s talent manager and there
are two well-known actors in the US but
learn that everything is a business at
the end of the day because moms are
always right I ended up going into
business school
and at Harvard Business School I got
elected to run the entertainment media
Club but I still loved animation so I
took an internship at Pixar where I
worked on Toy Story 3 in production and
I loved animation there but I was
craving to be part of an industry that
was growing and new rather than one that
was already mature so when I graduated I
went to Zynga who made farmville and I
was there for six years became vice
president of games and led the entire
farmville franchise but nights and
weekends I stopped animation so I ended
up working with my two friends from
Pixar on this short film called the damn
keeper which was nominated for an Oscar
for Best Animated Short the first time I
put on a VR headset I didn&#39;t like it I
didn&#39;t like it because all I could
notice was the resolution and the poor
pixels because our standards for reality
are very high but when I put on the
headset and saw animation that&#39;s when I
realized it was the future of animation
because it puts you in that magical
world and makes you believe that it&#39;s
truly there and so that was it I knew I
need to quit my job and I started this
new company bale bob studios and people
from both film and games are all
flocking to animation why why do they
love this new medium my two co-founders
in the middle Erik Darnell he
we wrote and directed all for Madagascar
films and also ants and Larry Cutler on
the right hand side is our CTO and he
worked on Toy Story 2 monster&#39;s ink and
then became global head of character
technology at DreamWorks and his judge
for the technical achievement awards and
those are all of our advisors at the
bottom the co-founder of Pixar the
co-founder of DreamWorks the co-founder
of twitch so why are all these people
jumping in it&#39;s because they said that
it feels the same way that it did when
Pixar and DreamWorks came about when the
beginning of CG animation was just
starting and nobody knew what they were
doing they&#39;re artists they&#39;re engineers
business people all coming together
trying to figure out a new industry and
that&#39;s why they&#39;re all so excited so
what is it about animation that makes
them all love it animation is are in
motion it takes you to completely
different worlds ones that you can never
imagine it makes you feel they&#39;re so
real that you think you could reach out
and touch it and those last two
sentences that I just said are also the
definition of virtual reality which is
why we think animation and VR were made
for each other and the mission of VR
animation at least to us is to bring out
that five year old and you back out to
bring out your sense of wonder and
inspire you to dream again I&#39;m going to
show you a quick clip about what VR
animation is at least to us so you know
I&#39;ll be talking about for the rest of
the talk
I had been working for over 20 years
directing feature animated films
subtractor on ants and a writer and
director on all the Madagascar films and
I decided that maybe it was time to try
something different and put on a VR
headset for the first time it blew me
away it&#39;s like this undiscovered
frontier we see virtual reality is a new
medium for telling stories and creating
great cinematic experiences that are
character driven it allows people to be
taken to places in two worlds that
otherwise wouldn&#39;t exist
[Music]
at bail Bob Studios what we&#39;re trying to
do is find the tools that we can use to
have a great story and tell it well and
have characters the audience is fat in
love with and do it in a context where
the viewer is a part of the story
[Music]
thank you so that there is Chloe the
bunny and you&#39;ll see her again later in
the talk but we do storytelling and
storytelling is all about getting you to
care so much about the characters you
love them or you hate them and you want
to know what happens that&#39;s why you
watch the entire story read the entire
book and we believe that VR makes you
care about these characters in a way you
could have never in these other previous
mediums so remember that scene where the
bunny comes out and jumps at you and
sniffs at you first of all in feature
films this is a big no-no you don&#39;t in
general break the fourth wall the
characters are not usually supposed to
talk to you and if they do break the
rules and they talk to you you don&#39;t
really believe that they&#39;re really
talking to you because you&#39;re in your
theater seats but the strange thing
happened when people watch this because
when you&#39;re in VR you see the entire
world around you is all ice it&#39;s snowing
and you look down you have a little
bunny body and when you squat you see
your funny body get fatter so you really
believe that you&#39;re there and people
would start to wave at her they would
start trying to pet at her and she they
would get on the ground and start
playing with her because they were sure
that she was interacting with them
in fact there&#39;s this one scene where
there are these two aliens when they had
their laser beams pointed at you you&#39;re
standing here as a bunny and she&#39;s
hiding behind you and people would say I
can feel her breath on my shoulder and I
need to protect her because I&#39;m the only
thing between her and these aliens and I
have to be a bunny shield that is not
something you could get when you&#39;re
watching a feature film something in
your reptile brain makes you believe
that these characters are truly real so
real that you care about them and you
want to help them so the next piece that
we created we took a lesson from
invasion in the first piece there were
no vr controllers yet all you could do
is stand there in different places but
by the time you got controllers you can
interact with the characters people
wanted to play with the bunny and now
with the controllers you can actually do
something about it now let me show you a
quick clip of this next piece I&#39;ll talk
about what was different about this
piece
[Music]
so those are the same two alien
characters and this time you are a
menial task space robot they don&#39;t like
you you think that you you&#39;re awful and
if you help them enough during the
entire piece you become a valued member
of the spaceship and you have your own
character arc as long as well as the
other characters and this was our
attempt to convert that empathy that you
feel for the other characters into
action which we call compassion where
you can actually help these other
characters now and in the third piece
that we have called Rainbow crow is
based off of a Native American tale
about the crow
you know how the crow looks today right
black feathers and the cawing voice now
Native American culture the crow used to
have beautiful rainbow feathers and a
beautiful singing voice in our VR
experience he&#39;s John Legend it&#39;s
beautiful and sings beautifully as well
and he decides to fly into the Sun to
bring warmth back to the planet to save
all his friends and in the process burns
all his feathers black and makes his
voice like a crow and make the ultimate
sacrifice we want to test out in this
experience whether or not we can make
you walk into a storybook world instead
of something that looks realistic what
is it like to have these soft edges does
it feel like you&#39;re walking into your
childhood dream but the reason why I&#39;m
expecially excited about this is because
of er&#39;s ability to bring out your
empathy and change your perspective
Jeremy bailenson at the Stanford VR lab
has proven that if you look in a mirror
in VR and you see that you are a black
woman and you look at the mirror for
long enough and you move around when you
take off the headset you actually behave
differently to people of different races
he&#39;s also proven that if you are put
into the face of a homeless person and
you go through the actions of being a
homeless person when you take off the
headset compared to when you just watch
a flat flat piece you are much more
moved and you&#39;re more likely to
empathize
with homeless people and actually help
them and in this piece
we specifically cast minorities and
women because I think it&#39;s very
important for people to be able to have
different perspectives other than the
ones that we always have so we have John
Legend Constance Wu Diego Luna and also
Randi Edmunds who&#39;s a famous Native
American in this piece and more
celebrities that we I can&#39;t talk about
just yet but look we announced soon so I
often times get asked is VR is it a film
or is it a game and I like to say it&#39;s
neither it&#39;s its own medium and the way
I explain it is imagine there&#39;s a little
girl crying on a park bench she&#39;s too
young to be by herself now imagine she&#39;s
crying in a film you feel very bad for
her but you&#39;re not gonna get out of your
theater seat to go help her in a game
you talk to her but the reason you talk
to her is to get to the next level to
win to become a hero or finish a quest
and in real life you would hopefully
talk to her because you really care and
you want to help her well in VR we have
the potential to have the empathy of
films the agency of games and the
motivation of real life where you care
about these characters in ways you don&#39;t
normally care about them because you
believe they&#39;re real and now you can do
something about that care you can
interact with them but you do it because
you care about them not because you&#39;re
trying to win and you&#39;re thinking about
them so this is why we&#39;re very excited
about VR it has the ability to suck you
in to the medium and get you to care
about these characters in ways you never
would have been be able to be before
there&#39;s some evolutionary theorists who
believe that storytelling is the reason
that Homo sapiens won out it&#39;s because
of our ability to tell rumors to be able
to say there&#39;s a lion over there don&#39;t
go there help us learn and it&#39;s again
the ability to experience characters and
stories beyond those we can experience
when you watch a movie you think oh I
feel really bad for that person what
what are they thinking how are they
feeling what would I do in their place
now in VR you can actually play a
character you actually experience it you
don&#39;t even just think about it passively
you form a memory you remember this
experience forever and you don&#39;t wonder
what would I do because you actually
have to act in VR you actually do and
that tells us who we are as humans and
who we could be and our true potential
thank you very much
[Applause]
