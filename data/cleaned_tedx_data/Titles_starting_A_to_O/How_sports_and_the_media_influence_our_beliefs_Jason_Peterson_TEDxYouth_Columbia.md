I&#39;ll admit it I&#39;m a faithful yet
perpetually disappointed sports fan as a
native of the state of Georgia I was
raised to be a fan of the Atlanta Hawks
and the truth of the matter is my stand
up is only from them as an adult so
sports clearly matter to me but I&#39;m not
the only one there are millions of
people who exercise a level of faith and
devotion into their teams of choice it
begs the question why do sports matter
to so many people on a simple level
sports are fun but upon a second planet
so much can bring us together can give
us a commonality through the good and
the bad that wins and the losses
according to authors Billings and Truman
Sports has infiltrated our society to
the point that there&#39;s very little
things left that have Undead have been
left untouched by athletics and in many
ways society and our daily lives are
very much reflected in sports so for us
it&#39;s clear that there is some sort of
social attraction but in my mind the
relationship between sports and society
runs much deeper in that so today I&#39;m
going to explain to you why sports
matter and why sports serve as a
reflective element within our society
I&#39;m going to explain to you why we have
an attraction to sports how the media
certainly perpetuates this love affair
and how the examination of our favorite
team can provide us with a social
spyglass into the norms and values of
our society now let&#39;s think for a moment
why do we love sports well in my mind
it&#39;s because of romanticism now
think of romance sometimes it&#39;s
illogical sometimes it&#39;s blind but
certainly there&#39;s a level of devotion
and I would argue that when it comes to
our love of sports there certainly is a
lack of logic there is a level of
devotion commitment but more often than
not this relationship is perpetuated by
myth let me give you an example there
are some parents out there who tell
themselves that the only way to teach
their children values such as teamwork
or camaraderie is through an early
involvement in athletics now certainly
sports can teach there&#39;s no doubt about
that but is it the only way and the
answer is no that&#39;s a that&#39;s a myth
Sports is not the only way to learn
these things
and oftentimes we go back to athletics
because we see it as an educational
outlet now speaking of romanticism and
myth sports also gives us the hero okay
now think about that for a moment think
about the hero as children we look to
athletes and we say you know what I want
to be that guy we emulate that athlete
we dress like that athlete we perform
like that athlete there is a genuine
fascination with that athlete but what
happens when your hero is Mark McGwire
who as he&#39;s speaking to Congress forgets
all the years of steroid abuse what if
your hero was Michael Vick who went to
prison for dog fighting what if your
hero was Mike Tyson who was convicted of
rape see here&#39;s the myth we look at
these individuals we put them on a
pedestal the fact is they are fallible
creatures they are just like us they
make mistakes
but as a sports consuming society it
hasn&#39;t stopped us from ascribing value
to these individuals in many ways we
treat sports like a religion now
according to the book religion in sports
in American culture both religion and
sports our social expressions that have
functional similarities please keep that
in mind
functional similarities look at how we
celebrate religion and sports we
congregate we gather usually in the same
place at the same time we celebrate we
dress appropriately for the occasion and
we pledge some level of faith to a deity
of our choice or to our favorite team so
you see clearly we place a level of
importance on sports in our society but
to what extent has sports really
infiltrated our cultural staples let me
give you an example when I say the
University of Alabama very few people
are going to say wow what a mathematics
department
the truth of the matter is the common
individuals going to say roll tide now
in this instance we have an educational
outlet an institute of higher education
higher learning that has become
instantly identifiable with the success
of its athletic program now before you
think to yourself and ask the question
hey isn&#39;t the institution upset about
this portrayal let me introduce you to
the Flutie effect name for fame Boston
College quarterback Doug Flutie Harvard
Business professor Doug Chun found that
when a team from a college or university
has a level of success in either
football or basketball applications to
that school increase 18.7% so colleges
and universities they benefit from this
persona they benefit from a successful
athletic program and what happens is as
a society we look towards an athletic
program and we instantly ascribe a value
that in truth is based on sports I want
you to think about another cultural
staple I want you to think about the
holiday specifically Thanksgiving think
about how you enjoy Thanksgiving you
gather with family and friends and you
feast all right what happens afterwards
you watch football
think of it this way ok think of it this
way it has become almost ritualistic we
will make sports fit into our holidays
into dates that matter and we&#39;ll do the
reverse as well we will make sports fit
into days that don&#39;t matter and the fact
of the matter is if something interferes
with that sport we will make changes how
many of you how many of you have ever
heard of a church coordinating their
Sunday night service with the Superbowl
the truth of the matter is they still
want to facilitate a level of attendance
and within our society you could easily
argue that maybe there aren&#39;t bigger
days on the sports calendar than the
Super Bowl we will make sports fit we
will accommodate sports you even see a
crossover between sports and politics I
give you the 1968 Olympics Americans
Tommie Smith and John Carlos took to the
medal stand and as the national anthem
played they raised a single fist in the
air and they bowed their heads they
staged a silent civil rights protest
concerning the conditions that African
Americans faced in this country during
the civil rights movement just this past
season in the NFL
we had San Francisco 49er quarterback
Colin Kaepernick who every time the
national anthem played kneeled and bowed
his head and in Kaepernick&#39;s mind he is
making a social statement about the
treatment of blacks in our society when
it comes to interactions with the police
now whether we agree or disagree these
individuals were vilified for their
actions but let&#39;s be honest they are not
siloed off from society they are a part
of it and they face the same problems
you and I face the same issues the major
difference here they have the platform
sports afforded them a stage and so they
took that moment to try to incite change
now as we say that the primary conduit
of this relationship between sports and
society is the media if we were to make
a decision about what is important in
our society and all we did was look at
the sheer amount of content sports would
be very high on that list when you look
at television we have a multitude of Fox
Sports and ESPN channels devoted to
specific niches within the marketplace
we have mobile apps we have social media
we have websites blogs message boards
magazines they are all devoted to sports
only content and no matter what&#39;s going
on in your local community no matter
what&#39;s going on in society pick up a
newspaper to this day they still devote
roughly 25% of all coverage to sports
now many a media scholar has told us
that the acquisition of information
through the media has profound effects
on the user and basically can impact
what we think is important and how we
formulate public opinion so if we&#39;re
looking at the media and we&#39;re saying to
ourselves what matters
clearly sports have to be on that list
now with that said certainly it&#39;s
somewhat cosmetic to make such a
statement but understand something the
media does not thrive without sports and
sports does not thrive without the media
it&#39;s a codependent relationship one does
not work at without the other the media
needs sports the sports need media
sports does not spread without the media
the media has a source of convenient and
cheap content and let&#39;s face facts we
watch sports because we love drama we
expect to see the unexpected the media
is well aware of this and if you really
think about it if there is a niche that
you like in the sports world you don&#39;t
have to wait too long somebody within
the media will tailor content for you
again it&#39;s a very codependent
relationship now with all of that said
it doesn&#39;t necessarily tell us how the
endeavors of our athletic teams can be
reflective of the society in which we
live in my mind you have to look very
much on the local level and from a local
perspective there is a typically
speaking there is a strong relation
ship between a community and the teams
that represent said community to the
point that they&#39;re reflective of one
another
historian Kurt Kipner wrote that sports
particularly in the south has value and
more often than not people look to other
sports teams for cultural validation now
think about that for a moment
we look towards athletics for cultural
validation you see in Kepler&#39;s mind we
should be able to look at the teams that
represent us and see a reflection of our
norms our values so I applied Kipp nurse
contention to my own research and in my
book full-court press I examined
Mississippi State University&#39;s men&#39;s
basketball team during the 1950s and 60s
during this time period Mississippi
State won multiple Southeastern
Conference championships yet they never
played in the NCAA tournament that
contention today would be unheard of so
why didn&#39;t they
because if kempner is correct and we
look at Mississippi State and we say
that team is reflective of us one of
those values was segregation and the
NCAA tournament was integrated and
understand in this time period any
consideration to integration was seen as
a gross social violation so Mississippi
State stayed away because they had to
maintain that reflection with the
society in which they lived
eventually state did play in the
tournament in 1963 and they lost to an
integrated team so what does that say it
tells us that as a society perhaps what
we believe in perhaps the values we hold
true maybe they&#39;re wrong
maybe our belief in our faith and
segregation was wrong
interestingly enough the press in
Mississippi completely ignored the loss
they moved on because it was not a
reality they were willing to address at
that point so if we hold our values true
and we expect to see a reflection of our
social norms and values within our
athletics Mississippi system was broken
and it stayed that way even through the
recruitment of African American athletes
which did not happen in that state until
1968 if you want a more contemporary
example I urge you to look at the
Olympics every day without fail in this
country we hear about the medal count
why because we&#39;re number one we&#39;re
American and we have to win let me give
you the 1988 men&#39;s Olympic basketball
team it&#39;s the last team in the Olympics
from a male perspective in basketball
that was completely made up of
collegiate athletes and you know what
they won the bronze that year they lost
to the Soviet Union now in a lot of
situations in a lot of countries a
bronze medal is wonderful but not in
America we&#39;re free
we&#39;re democracy we&#39;re number one
and in no way in no way is it acceptable
to lose to the Soviet Union during the
Cold War we are not a third-place team
we&#39;re not a third-place country so what
happens well in 1992 the Olympics raid
the professional ranks and we get the
fabled Dream Team of Michael Jordan and
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird you see in
both situations something was broken
those teams weren&#39;t reflecting the
values of the society in which they
served so you know what something
had to change now when it comes to the
Olympics and men&#39;s basketball and
eighty-eight and then subsequently in 92
they thought the team was broken so
that&#39;s what changed in Mississippi it
was the society that was broken and they
quickly learned that that archaic
oppressive way of life just wasn&#39;t going
to last so see we can look towards
sports and we can learn valuable lessons
about ourselves and about the societies
in which we live in closing let me
stress to you that I clearly view sports
as being important and I acknowledge
that some people find little interest in
the notion of sports but don&#39;t be so
quick to dismiss in my mind sports do
not exist in a vacuum they are a cog in
society just like education just like
politics just like religion just like
entertainment now understand I&#39;m not
ascribing value I am NOT telling you
that one is better than the other I&#39;m
simply asking that you consider the
ramifications of what sports does for us
as a society and what it says to us if
you want to know what a society thinks
if you want to know what a community
holds true try looking at their
representative sports teams thank you
very much
[Applause]
