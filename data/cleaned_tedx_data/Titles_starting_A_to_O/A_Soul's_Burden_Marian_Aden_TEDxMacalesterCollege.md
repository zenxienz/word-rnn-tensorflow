there&#39;s a verse in the Quran that states
a soul isn&#39;t burdened beyond what it can
bear this verse helped me through one of
the hardest moments in my life it
provided me comfort in knowing that I
wasn&#39;t in control and that the one who
is wouldn&#39;t give me more than I could
handle grief is something that is rarely
talked about in everyday life people
don&#39;t know what to say to someone who&#39;s
grieving and those who are grieving are
afraid of being judged for talking about
their grieving process we&#39;ve stigmatized
grief so much to the point that we&#39;ve
placed arbitrary timelines on the
grieving process the other day I was at
the grocery store and I heard a woman
talking on the phone and she said he&#39;s
been dead for 10 years
stop talking about it move on so many
thoughts were going through my head in
this moment but the one that stuck out
the most was that what gives her anyone
else for that matter the right to
dictate someone else&#39;s grieving process
this was a clear example to me of how
folks are forced and pushed to grieve in
secret
that&#39;s okay
foolish for sugreeva secret there would
be a picture of my parents up here and I
would say these are my parents and they
immigrated here from the from Somalia
not too long before I was born they like
most parents did the best they could
with what they had to provide my sisters
and I with the best experience possible
they taught us about love faith respect
and through their actions we learned
about work ethic perseverance and
resiliency they never shied away from
our questions about death the afterlife
or grief and at a very young age we knew
that death is something that comes to
all of us and that every soul was going
to taste death at one point in their
life right and in that moment they gave
us the strength to know that grief is a
natural part of life one of the stories
that sticks out to me most growing up
was the story of my grandfather&#39;s
funeral my grandfather passed away in
Italy after receiving treatment for
pancreatic cancer and my mother was with
him throughout this process and so he
had to be flown back to Somalia for his
funeral and my mother wouldn&#39;t never
shied away or sugar-coated the pain that
she felt that day when she noticed my
grandfather&#39;s casket be loaded onto a
plane the same way that luggage was
loaded onto a plane and every time I
heard this story I would think to myself
what would you do if you were to lose a
parent and anytime that they would be
sick or they didn&#39;t answer the phone
that&#39;s where my mind went but of course
just as quickly as those thoughts came
into my mind they were long gone once I
heard from them and they knew that they
were okay but in November of 2015
that all changed my mother was diagnosed
with stage 4 cancer that had spread
throughout her body and now the thought
of losing a parent the thought of losing
my mother was very real the next year
and a half was filled with countless
doctors a point
mints keep rounds of chemo and just
medication so much medication and my
mother although her physical strength
was weakening her spathe in her will to
persevere through this only grew
stronger earlier this year the morning
of Monday April 17th I got a call from
my family to let me know that my mother
was being rushed to the hospital I
dropped everything I got on a flight and
I went home that Friday April 21st
around 8 a.m. I held my mother&#39;s hand as
she took her last breath in that moment
looking back I was in a state of shock
followed by an overwhelming numbness I
remember a tear rolling down my face as
I remember my father closing my mother&#39;s
eyes and giving her a kiss on the
forehead the next day the female family
members including my sisters and I
prepared my mother&#39;s body for burial in
accordance to our Islamic faith and the
days and weeks that followed I was
surrounded by family and loved ones and
there was always something to do and
someone to talk to but never a moment to
fully process everything that was going
on then the time came for me to come
back to work so I got on a flight I
found my seat and when I soon as I sat
down tears uncontrollably started
rolling down my face I tried everything
to make it stop but nothing worked and
so I thought to myself I&#39;m just gonna
let this be it&#39;ll be okay then I started
thinking about the future and these
images started to come into my mind and
in that moment I came to the realization
that these images of weddings and
celebrations and pregnancies and whatnot
then now I&#39;d have to remove my mother
from all of those images needless to say
that didn&#39;t help with my tears and the
woman sitting next to me on the plane
was very
very concerned so I finally came back
and was alone for the first time in a
while and all I can do was cry I never
want to didn&#39;t want to be around anyone
I just wanted to be left alone and I
just wanted to eventually stop crying
and now it&#39;s been months since my mother
has passed and it feels like yesterday
and a decade ago all at the same time I
get moments where I&#39;m driving to work or
I&#39;m in a meeting sending an email
talking to a friend and tears just come
to me and I don&#39;t know what to do and
for a while I thought something was
wrong with me until very recently I
couldn&#39;t even watch Grey&#39;s Anatomy
because and I love that show because the
sounds from the hospital machines would
remind me so much and bring back the
most vivid images of my mother&#39;s final
days and for a while
shortly after my mom&#39;s passing I
couldn&#39;t even talk to her sisters
because their voices and their faces
would remind me so much of my mom so
when we don&#39;t talk about grief we make
it harder to grieve we make it so that
people are forced to grieve in secret
and are forced to be alone throughout
this process grief isn&#39;t something that
you just get over it&#39;s something that
lives with you and sticks with you
forever for the rest of your life I&#39;m
grateful for people in my life like a
dear friend who shared her story of
grief as she went through losing her mom
as well and I&#39;m grateful for the people
in my life who were there for me when I
needed them most like my cousin&#39;s who
dropped literally everything within me
calling them and we&#39;re on a plane with
me within hours of getting that call and
we&#39;re there by my side when all of this
was happening I&#39;m grateful for my father
and my sisters although we&#39;re grieving
in such different ways we continue to
remind each other that we&#39;re not going
through this alone and that were there
for each other but above all of that I&#39;m
grateful for my faith for
keeping me grounded through one of the
toughest storms that I&#39;ve ever had to
face in my life so far so if someone
shares with you their story of grief
pain loss I know it&#39;s gonna be
uncomfortable and I know you&#39;re gonna
want to feel something and you want to
do something about it and make it better
just bear witness to their grief and
listen to them and let them know they&#39;re
not alone if you are someone who&#39;s
grieving and have gone through some pain
and loss in your life when you&#39;re ready
and you&#39;re comfortable enough share your
story there are many people who wish
that they heard from others who were
going through the same process so I
leave you with those two things listen
to other people&#39;s grief listen to their
stories and share your stories about
pain loss and grief so that no one is
ever forced to grieve in silence and no
one is ever forced to do this alone and
that they have to do it in secret and
grief is a normal part of life and so
folks know that it&#39;s a normal way to go
through it thank you
