good morning good morning I&#39;m excited to
be here and Logan I&#39;m a set decorator
decorator in the movie business
and I&#39;m also Brentwood alumni I went to
school here from 1980 to 1985 and when I
graduated I was at the middle of my
class this is the top of the class
that&#39;s the bottom of the class I was in
the middle an average student but that&#39;s
okay because by definition a lot of us
have to be average and that doesn&#39;t mean
I didn&#39;t work hard in fact I remember
working very hard to get through algebra
12 not a fan of algebra but I I want to
talk to you about my career and how I
while I think the grades are important
they&#39;re not everything and doesn&#39;t
always affect you all the way through
your life now I&#39;m going to go through
quite a few slides so hang on because
I&#39;ve only got 13 minutes to do this but
I think it started by a fascination with
performance and theater and movies
started with this it&#39;s a puppet theater
that I got when I was about 5 years old
mine was a marionette stage and I set it
on the floor and I played with
marionettes and I just loved the idea of
onstage and offstage just loved
marionettes when I was about 10 years
old my mother took me to this location
in Vancouver where they were filming the
movie The Changeling
and I remember specifically being
fascinated by the fake rock walls that
they painted in the vines and how
they&#39;re able to make it look so creepy
and when I was at Brentwood in grade 11
I assisted with the set design and
construction of the sets for Hello Dolly
I think there&#39;s pictures of it in the
lobby well I was at UBC finishing a
degree in English literature I was
fascinated by this sort of thing the
film production and so as I was
finishing school there I started to meet
other film students worked on
commercials worked on music videos and
eventually conned my way on to a local
independent production Canadian
production called impolite I was a
production assistant was directing
traffic watching how it all went
together but by lunch of that first day
I joined the art department they were my
people they were putting the sets
together and I just loved it I never
looked back and for the next 25 years I
worked on lots of different movies big
blockbusters and
movies comedy action and I loved it all
it was all hard work Mission Impossible
was a particularly fun one along the way
I had the good fortune to work with this
man his name is Jim Erickson he&#39;s now
retired on salt spring island but he won
an Oscar for the movie Lincoln and he
taught me a lot about making movies and
details and doing research and he
specialized in period films these are
some of the films that he&#39;s worked on
and he called me one day and said Hamish
you better read this book somebody&#39;s
going to give you a call
so anybody seen this movie it&#39;s
restricted what do you guys what do you
you&#39;re not supposed to have seen this
movie anyways if you haven&#39;t seen the
movie it&#39;s a true story of a man named
Hugh glass in the 1820s in the upper
Missouri area of the United States and
he was a fur trapper attacked by a
grizzly bear left for dead by his
compatriots um before they left him they
robbed him and he didn&#39;t die and
survived and went after these guys it&#39;s
a revenge story so Jim said read the
book because this man is going to call
you oh sorry this is where it was this
man is gonna call you mr. cool Jack
Fiske an amazing production designer so
I should explain how it works in movies
you have a production designer is in
charge of the entire look of the movie
and then you&#39;ve got the construction
department that builds the sets the
painters that paint the sets the art
department to do the drawing so that you
can get those things built and set
declaration my department which
populates the sets with all the items
that make it look real for example a
police station construction and paint
would do the walls and the stairs and I
would put all the desks since things in
there wanted posters so Jack said let&#39;s
work on this movie I interviewed and
interviewed with him he hired me
let&#39;s work for this man Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu a very talented and
demanding director we&#39;re gonna film this
movie in Alberta over the course of an
old eight-month winter it was very
difficult on the crew also difficult on
the cast here they are covered in
leather and fur acting like fur trappers
going through the mountains so we had to
do our research now this is all pre
photography so how are we going to find
out what things were like then we read
journals we consulted with museums we
looked at hundreds of paintings by three
main painters of the day Miller Bodnar
and Caitlin
and we pored over those things for all
the details and we had to become experts
in the fur trade it was lots of fun
getting back into that sort of stuff so
the script called for a flatboat this is
the type of thing that you would move
the furs from the wilderness down the
st. Louis so how are we going to do this
well we look at paintings we look at
illustrations jak builds a model art
department draws it and we build it put
it in the water it starts to look like
the real thing
my things on there that Bale is a fern
the tarps and the ropes the hardware the
secret about this boat actually had a
400 horsepower jet engine hidden inside
of it so we could go ripping around the
river but it looked really good in the
movie legitimate for all the actors
Leonardo DiCaprio was our lead so I am
obsessed with details Jim taught me that
so canvases and furs and leather had to
look not only historically accurate but
had to look like it been out in the
wilderness and used by these guys in
these harsh environments so I would
fixate on things like this like mildew
it&#39;s really important to me because I
never knew when a camera was gonna be
really close to an actor&#39;s face next to
a car for something like that the bags
that the trackers carry it all had
individual nuances to them that was
really important so the director wanted
me to convey the industry that these
guys were in this is pre Gold Rush the
fur was the gold so to do that I had to
create a butchering area where they
would kill and skin the book the beavers
so I checked with producers and I
checked with the government of Alberta
they weren&#39;t gonna let me kill a couple
hundred beavers so I wouldn&#39;t do that
anyways so we use styrofoam we use fake
fur we use latex and lots of tricks we
actually looked at real pictures of
beavers getting gutted my challenge had
crews started to put it together and
before you know it we were able to
create a scene so when actors walked in
they really felt that they were trappers
in this time I think it looked really
good in the movie kind of scary
sometimes so this guy he&#39;s he&#39;s a
Hudson&#39;s Bay photograph and he&#39;s looking
and grading furs and you see what&#39;s on
his lap there is a layer of a layer of
beaver pelts heading down the very
valuable to those trappers one of those
bales is worth a year&#39;s wages and they
needed a lot of them for the movie and
how am I going to do that I can&#39;t give
them any beaver pelts I had to figure it
out I had to think about this with my
guys and we came up with a trick of
layering
and this and tucking in furs and
painting it wrapping it with leather and
before you know it it looks like the
real thing even though it&#39;s an inch
thick
we move these things all over the place
now most movies when I deliver a set I
deliver it to the director and I move on
but this one Jack and I were stuck on
set quite often supporting the camera
and making sure it was okay so here I am
arranging I think dead guys and building
a fish we&#39;re frozen river I also found
myself in a whoever positioning a dead
elk just so for the camera sometimes you
just got to do it yourself we filmed the
bear attack sequence up in Squamish was
fascinating I don&#39;t know if you guys
know how we did this but it was CGI blue
suits cables they were pulling leo
around for a couple days on these cables
and I remember standing there going I&#39;m
really enjoying this and then I
remembered I like marionettes the
world&#39;s most expensive marionette right
there and there&#39;s a guy taking a little
break all fake don&#39;t worry so one of the
forts one of the sets I had to do was
the fort and it&#39;s when the guys after
they got attacked had to get back to the
fort so again we looked at paintings
we&#39;ve studied we pre-built the buildings
on stage and took him out to the spray
Lakes area by Kenmore and assembled them
and let the painters have Adam and after
a while when the weather started to get
to it I brought in my items and it
starts to look like a real place again I
referenced a Hudson&#39;s Bay photograph
this is a fur press a piece of
technology that existed in the late
1800s but also a hundred years earlier
they use it to cram those furs down into
tight bales before they sent them off to
st. Louis so I looked at this photograph
I thought we just got to build one of
these things and based off the
photograph we built one on stage and had
the painters paint it and brought it out
to location and taught the actors how to
use it and make great background action
we&#39;re all very pleased with the results
of the Ford as well now here&#39;s a little
bit of obsessive detail this is the fort
and you can see the teepees outside no
one ever told me that the camera would
start on this flag but I didn&#39;t have to
worry about it because I&#39;m sort of
obsessive about this sort of thing the
1822 flag is a 24 star flag and I did my
research and so I had this flag
custom-built it&#39;s made of wool dyed to
my specifications and the entire thing
is hand-sewn
specifically every star on that flag is
hand cut and hand sewn and each one is
work oriented differently on its access
not up and down its period correct for
the time so I knew that when the camera
went up there I didn&#39;t have to apologize
I can go ahead guys it&#39;s all gonna be
good you can film away we had lots of
teepees outside lots of fun doing these
30 of them I think lots of detail again
I didn&#39;t know when the camera was gonna
get out there so I had to be ready all
the time I love this picture because
we&#39;ve got a Steadicam very modern piece
of equipment and behind the operators
200 years ago these are our guys coming
into the fort and you can see how
important my bales are there if you look
at this photograph things even more
important than Leo I joke that this
isn&#39;t this is some people would call
this a picture of Leonardo DiCaprio I
think it&#39;s a picture of a period-correct
pot hanging on a hook and Leo happens to
be in the picture Henry&#39;s house this is
the fur trade captain&#39;s house interior
that I got to put a lot of detail into
now I again I never know where the
camera is gonna be and a lot of this may
not end up in the movie but I know that
the actors are gonna go work in there
and I want when them when they go in
there with a director I want them to
feel like they&#39;re really in that place
they don&#39;t get taken out of it they feel
that they&#39;re in 1822 so I went through a
lot of effort I actually found a
calligrapher in Calgary who transposed
some real letters from Henry to his
bosses in New York and I had been put on
his desk so he felt like using
environment and again I do this so when
the actor and the director sit down they
feel that the effort has been put in and
they can just go forward it&#39;s really fun
to do things like that now one of the
sequences a dream sequence was this pile
of Buffalo skills they checked with the
producers in the government of Alberta
and they weren&#39;t going to let me kill a
couple thousand Buffalo no I wouldn&#39;t do
that but I did get ten skulls and I made
a mold and then we figured out we could
repeat this and we&#39;ll put it on a frame
two sides a pyramid will build that on
stage and then we&#39;ll take it out to
location and before you know it we&#39;ve
created the illusion that we&#39;ve got a
pile of skulls there and again we were
very happy with results we thought it
worked one of the crazy days when these
two actors were supposed to be eating a
raw buffalo meat and the
it&#39;s really cold and the fake blood just
didn&#39;t look right when you were close at
the camera and I was trying to solve
this problem it&#39;s me usually not my
problem but somebody had to solve it so
I looked at even strawberry jell-o to
see if that would work and I started
obsessing about the appearance of blood
and snow and one night it was in a
gelato shop and I just found myself
staring at this gelato going well that
could work I mean that could be Buffalo
blood if I needed so you never know
where your influences are gonna come
from so we spent a lot of time in the
woods hiding watching them film and then
getting ready for the next scenes even
some of my favorite sets we had to burn
because the story required it so
remember I said I took stage craft at
Brentwood well here&#39;s my report card
signed by mr. bunch himself after who
this building is named and it&#39;s
encouraging words let&#39;s look at that
grade there yeah average pretty average
but you know in all my career and all my
interviews no ever once did they say you
know Hamish you&#39;re the right guy for the
job you seem to have the energy you&#39;re
pretty good at this it&#39;s that C+ for a
little worried about never came up not
once and what I did find is that in life
you get other types of report cards
promotions job offers a stack of resumes
in your desk if people don&#39;t want to
work for you and occasionally accolades
so when the revenant started to garner a
lot of accolades we were all pretty
excited for the work that we&#39;ve done
because it was a lot of work that put
the effort into it so if I could ask the
spirit of Gil bunch to review my C+ I
think maybe I could ask for a little
more this time maybe we&#39;ll just have a
little review of that score and when I
if you were to ask me what that score
would be the moment I stepped onto the
red carpet at the Oscars in recognition
for my work on the Oscars I would say in
stagecraft probably get an A probably
get an A at this point I include this
picture because I think Casey nice dad
means something to you guys two million
views and if you do get a chance to go
to the Oscars I recommend it it is a lot
of fun you meet a lot of very
interesting people that&#39;s my wife Jane
and right
so what I&#39;d like to say is that while
grades are important what&#39;s really
important is you find hopefully
something passionate in your life
something that you can feel there&#39;s
worth your energies and then the hard
work comes naturally and after that so
do the A&#39;s thanks very much
[Applause]
