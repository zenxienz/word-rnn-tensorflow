by the way guys I paid them for this
reduction so let&#39;s have a round of
applause for them you know yeah you did

very nice I have to be honest with you
guys I am nervous and I feel as if it is
my wedding night and surprisingly my
wife is sitting right here you can say
hi to her name is Kanaka ah thank you so
very much
okay guys so I&#39;ve been told that I am
the last year after this you are going
to have lunch is it yeah that is what I
was told that means at least I will take
one ah and I have been also told by
Shubham that you guys love PowerPoint
presentations yeah I is it aa couple of
people so guys you&#39;re safe I am NOT
going to have any pop on presentation
but we are going to just enjoy on the
way and I&#39;m going to share my own
journey so happy all set for journey
guys oh wow
wonderful wonderful so uh by the way I&#39;m
gonna start my own story and my story
was something similar to this Cola
bottle something similar you can say I
was very calm and composed just like
this cool important but gradually over
time what happened I&#39;m going to share
with you I will show you yeah so change
started to come in my life and it was
coming slowly I was able to keep up with
the pace yeah but then the change was
vigorous and it was so vigorous that
somehow I was not able to control my
emotions and I give up this is what
happened when I started my journey today
guys I won&#39;t share in this small video
how I rebuilt my life after I gave up on
myself so that&#39;s the story I&#39;m gonna
share today guys and it all started when
I was waiting for my 10 standard results
it was a midnight I was waiting on the
website and I had pretty high
expectations out of
said anything above 40 was a dream come
true yeah so that was my expectation and
finally what happened results EMI score
66% and I was extremely happy I was
parting the next day but surprisingly my
friends they were highly depressed
highly depressed they got 92% and they
were like depressed and there was a
reason to it I remember during those
times my parents used to tell me in this
shit be what you want to be and that is
okay with us but my friends they got to
here become like Charmides son yeah some
my appearance also you say that become
whatever you want engineer or a doctor
and then what happened guys people chose
different paths ingenious who are good
ingenious became doctors doctors became
accountants accountants became sales
people and there was whole drama of life
that was happening after my trails that
was I that that&#39;s what I was observing
all the way people was stuck in the
wrong professions only due to this
pressure that was coming in finally a
time came for me to choose to choose her
either engineering were medical but
somehow I heard that engineering is an
evergreen branch I thought yes I&#39;m going
to join engineering I took of injuring
and finally I entered into the class
this was my first day in my engineering
college and I saw a group of 38 boys
sitting in the glass
and I was shocked you know why because I
choose mechanical engineering and I
thought bear is the greenery and this is
what I missed her throat my college life
are four years of fasting you can say
this was my life during the during time
but you know what during my engineering
time I met these four people in India
that commonly called charlo with
engineering Cologne a third chart look
Topanga you take up engineering after
that with a job little detour Charlo
yeah thing you take up a job after that
british avec Elle Oh neato go hang it
avec le whichever the colony though
Charlo cock ring but she basically
escaped a girl in lo garden alone eh our
dog can&#39;t hang it yes this is what the
drama that is happening in India right
now I think I will change this in the
country so if we happen to meet these
four people anywhere around I have an
answer and you go tell them it is called
my o P mind your own business
yeah so whenever you meet these four
people tell them my OB and listen to
your inner voice that&#39;s the message I
want to share with you because that
inner voice is going to guide you
towards your dream destination you are
going to be extremely happy in the
coming times
finally in cheering happened four years
of mine cheering I enjoyed with all the
boys and I was just waiting for the
green tea to happen in my life and then
finally our time came after four years I
didn&#39;t get a girl but I did get a job
yeah finally I joined one of the leading
IT organizations of India and I was
quite happy the gender ratio was 50/50 I
said wow that&#39;s beautiful
and my wife is going to kill me I know
this as well after this so finally I
joined this I
the organization and made both friends
they had the excellent amenities you
talked about the swimming pool a long
tennis court a gymnasium a steam player
sauna place and the grocery store our
bag a dormitory to stay you can no wash
your clothes in the laundromat
everything available in one campus and I
thought this is the place I am going to
spend my rest of my life this is the
best thing that has ever happened to me
up to that point but after one year
after one year that inner voice not and
it said Bishop this thing I was asking
who you guys also it said they should
can you do what you are doing right now
for the next 40 years can you be going
to be a software developer throughout
your life and I said no I cannot and
that was the time when I really took a
decision that I have to change my entire
life now I can&#39;t be settled in what I am
doing so this is the question I want to
share with you guys as well you got to
ask yourself can you do what you are
doing for the next 40 years and be happy
as well ultimately why we&#39;re working we
are working for money why we&#39;re earning
money to sustain our needs and why are
we sustaining our needs just to be happy
happiness is the code that&#39;s the point I
want to share with you guys during that
stent at the idea organization I realize
that I have to do something else
so what I did I joined the course on
public speaking and I thought that&#39;s a
good opportunity to learn something
beyond your work as well I took of
public speaking and I realized that this
is something that I like to do most I
love to be on stage it was that time I
decided that I am going to just quit
this company with this organization and
move into this domain of public speaking
and after that I took up a unique course
at India there are very few people who
take up this course
this is called m.b.a yeah so this is
what happened I took our MBA course and
during that time I thought that it is
going to be again fun all green tea but
somehow it is called bitch by PPT and
again you know the same dilemma am I at
the right place the inner voice during
my MBA of course I thought Apple to
something beyond my regular studies and
it was this time I decide that I decided
that I&#39;m gonna write a book and people
said mission
are you serious on the right book I said
yes and they said Lee shit you don&#39;t
have any experience here got an
alternate elsewhere but still I listened
to my inner voice it said they should go
ahead and write the book I wrote the
book I said it to various publishing
houses
I got rejections but somehow one
publishing house they said &#39;no shit we
are interested in publishing your book
and you don&#39;t need to spend a single
penny just give us the copyright I said
let&#39;s have a shared copyright and I
published my first book during my MBA
beyond my studies that was called
setbacks to come backs that was my first
book during an MBA I&#39;m sharing this got
to impress you guys but to impress on
the fact that when once you listen to
your voice
anything is possible only when you act
action is very important during my MBA
duration time I thought okay I have
written a book as well I need to know
something else I said you know what I
studied this book on emotional
intelligence I&#39;m going to create a
lecture and give lectures on emotional
intelligence at various other be schools
I started doing do that as well and
gradually you know people got to know
that Bishop is someone who is delivering
lectures on emotional intelligence so
why not call him I got a call one day
and they said initiative we are
interested in having our employees
trained on emotional intelligence
I have seen your work know throughout
this of this era now and we believe that
you can add value to us I said can you
give you a background he said yeah
I am from XYZ foundation and this is
managed by one of India&#39;s you know we
can say it best the best IPS officer
could you be interested in taking up the
session and I was thinking this is like
wow just by listening to the inner voice
I was able to crack this kind of thing I
said can I check my schedule please and
get back to you we are and within two
hours I said I yes I delivered the sir
first session at a corporate house and
this was my opening into the field of
public speaking and it all happened
because I was listening to my inner
voice yeah so finally I know took up
after the MBA I had to take up a job
because sustaining is also very
important you have to sustain yourself
we say that you have to do what you love
to do but then sustaining is also very
important how you&#39;re going to get the
bread and butter
I took up a job and the first thing the
interviewer asked me this shit you don&#39;t
have the experience
so why should we give you the job
I had a dancer
and was cute with this answer they
selected me and the answer was if
experience would have been the only
criteria man would have never landed on
the moon the point on share with you
guys is experiences not at all the
criteria you can see so many on the
photos nowadays and they are cracking
big odds they are making huge companies
and they are beating so many other
people in business experience not the
criteria guys it is the filling nests to
learn adapt and do the new if you can do
that I think anything is possible so
experience is not at all the criteria
finally what happened I took up a job
and I was managing this during function
in the company I went forward and you
know started to think again what can I
do beyond nine-to-five I was overweight
doctor said that mission you might have
an early heart attack if you go at this
pace you need to slow down I took up
yoga
I said this is something I&#39;d like who
can I make a profession out of my hobby
and inner voice said yes it is possible
yes it is possible and I trusted that
inner voice and I took up a
certification course a one-year diploma
in yoga Sciences I lost weight and
that&#39;s why I was on in the speaker list
as well
invited by other people who know my
weight loss story which I&#39;m going to
share today but the point I want to
share is that once you listen to your
inner voice it is going to guide you in
the right direction provided you take
action I did my yoga certification and
this way I got calls from various of the
competition he have lost weight you are
setting an example why don&#39;t you come
and train our employees on yoga why
don&#39;t you conduct sessions and I thought
wow people are paying me for something
that I love to do now imagine this this
is not work at all it all happened
because I was ready to work beyond

nine-to-five beyond 9:00 to 5:00 that&#39;s

the point if you can work beyond 9:00 to

5:00 and spend your time wisely
listening to her inner calling I think
everything is possible
I will never recommend you to quit your
job if you are thinking that never

sustain your job but beyond 9:00 to 5:00
work on your hobbies and be serious
then what happened gradually uh slowly I
took up more hobbies and started to
expand my profession and now time now

nowadays I do what I like to do 9:00 to

5:00 as well or it happened only slowly
and gradually so this is how you build a
career as well start slow and then
gradually you build that career in that
domain
people ask finish it can you give me
some tips on how to make your hobby into
a profession so I&#39;m going to give you
two tips before I leave
tip number one be the best in your
domain someone said &#39;no shit if
engineers were to do what they love they
would become porn stars
you know i understand and i say to them
that become a porn star and become the
best console in the world that is my you
know take on this we you need be the
best and the second thing I will share
with you guys is create value with
whatever you are doing for example if
you love watching television but how can
you earn money watching television you
have to create value for other people
you can be probably writing a blog you
can be recommending some programs some
channels but create some kind of value
so that people also learn from your
parent on skill watching a television
you like this but it cannot earn money
out of it you have to sustain yourself
as well money is important I will say
and how will that money come only when
you add value to people around so the
value you add is almost equivalent to
the money you also receive where that I
finally say goodbye to you guys and
thank you so very much for calling me
thank you
you
