I&#39;m sure each one of you here had
watched Steve Jobs commencement speech
and Stanford one thing that stayed with
me was you cannot connect the dots
looking forward you can only connect
them looking backwards I was a medical
student with aspirations of being a
doctor to heal pain but at the end of
the first year I dropped out and changed
my degree after much thought I decided
to become a petrochemical engineer
totally different I wish I could tell
you that I was a genius who started
watching documentaries about
nanotechnology fibers or dreaming of
them who even dreams about that but like
many ordinary people I found my passion
for nanotechnology the day I started
working with it at the time a UB had the
first nanotech lab in the region and I
was really curious about that field so I
joined that team with lots of day and
might shift in the lab it was not
glamorous it was definitely not
action-packed but look it was the start
of a love that began to grow over the
past couple of years an idea came to
mind
why not merge my initial interest and
Madison was the work I&#39;m doing right now
so I set out my mind write a proposal
and presented to my advisors their
answer to me that day was it was
unfeasible engineering-wise was this a
failure on my part
did I miss calculate somewhere in my
head ideas were spinning but if you
can&#39;t convince your research advisor the
one who taught you
you know in the first place you
certainly begin to question yourself but
being stubborn I decided to pursue that
idea if I have the slightest chance
I want to grasp it and isn&#39;t that what
research is all about what I realized is
that you can with the research you can
and this is what I wanted to do so I
held on to that idea and pushed myself
to work on developing it into reality
and here&#39;s where it all changed so I
moved on to my family&#39;s Chalet chilled
up the beach and ideas kept popping into
my head if only life was like movies it
would be perfect what I actually did was
sell lots of what I owned rented
virtually and turn it into a full
chemical engineering laboratory my
parents thought I might have gone crazy
they even wanted to send me to a
psychologist some of my friends did as
well but I was persistent 10 months had
passed I was living between four walls
of my mini lab with no results day after
day was negative answers I began to
believe I had failed I even start
questioning myself what the heck were
you thinking about this idea might not
even be achievable at first I chose to
give up I thought that a different goal
is not worth the effort
but before surrendering I wanted to try
one last thing I might as well do what
every lab researcher likes to do shock
things into submission so I applied
40,000 volt to the polymer I&#39;m working
with
and something changed I was able to
scale up that nanotechnology thousand
times what was something I thought to be
a failure turned out to be my biggest
success and now I thought it was the
failure of my life but it was my plan a
and I can&#39;t shift anymore the basis of
the snap of this invention as to
hardness nanotechnology as means to
apply petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals
toward an early textile so I was able to
transform any wearable clothes and to
waterproof breathable and the
antibacterial phase that delivers
medicine from the inside for different
health issues like wound burns
especially third-degree burns diabeetus
ulcers and muscle strain and this is
done through the impregnation of a drug
delivery system inside the Nano fibers
that delivered the medication and
extract the accident through the right
moisture vapor transmission rate and
reality imagine there&#39;s lots of nano
fibers on your t-shirt and there&#39;s drugs
inside and some micro tunnels that
remove secretions of the wound without
having to remove the bandage itself and
risk infection as simple as that but
like all researchers I have bigger ideas
in mind my goal is more than a half a
tonne machine that heals and so my
colleagues and I said to do just that we
started initially with electro spun
surgical mesh for heaney repair and
micro engineered synthetic vascular
graft for coronary bypass the importance
of nano fibers resides in the fact that
that can create scaffolds
of different body tissue and organs and
biomimetic blood vessel networks
allowing cells to grow within layers of
the support system and self arranged
into the anticipated configuration what
I was doing is contributing to the
future of medicine but I was doing it
with an idea that was at first a failed
idea each failure
each disappointment made me who I am
today I never aspired to dream big as
big as I do now and I can&#39;t imagine
where failure may lead I&#39;m sure to a
bigger goal what we should always think
about is that even your biggest failure
can result to a bigger success thank you
[Applause]
