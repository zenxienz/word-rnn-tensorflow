everybody please get your mobile phones
out and please turn up the volume as
loud as you can
you&#39;ll see why and when you&#39;re done
please stick your phone into the air so
I can see when a majority has actually
done it and I&#39;d like to start with a
couple of questions I see a majority now
has it but for whom was reaching for
their smartphone the very first thing
they did this morning majority and who
since leaving the house has not been
further than one meter away from his or
her smartphone we&#39;re pretty hooked right
and who there it goes and who actually
thinks this is a good idea this is a
good thing being connected all the time
a bit less a lot less there are some few
brave people when it&#39;s really strange if
you think about it
that we so often want to be doing
different things and checking our
smartphones and still they keep sucking
us in and today I want to show you that
this is intentionally designed by
Silicon Valley and that this is a bad
thing this company&#39;s hack our attention
and with paying our attention we quite
literally do that we pay attention and
we cannot afford to pay attention in the
vast amounts that we do it now this is
not going to be a talk about how bad
technology is I love technology I&#39;m a
journalist covering technology I could
not live without it I could not envision
working without it hey this was even my
profile picture at one point but I do
notice that my own device behavior is
getting ever stranger and more
compulsive I installed an app to check
how many hours a day I&#39;m on this device
and it reaches up to four to five hours
a day
I even regularly experience a phenomenon
called phantom vibrations where I feel
it in my pocket when it&#39;s not even there
so hey I&#39;m Bowser and I&#39;m an addict
and by the time probably you&#39;ve heard a
couple of sounds in the audience and I&#39;m
not alone I think I&#39;m not the only one
who is addicted and sounds are not the
only way that these companies get your
attention probably by now it&#39;s a good
idea if we switched our phones off again
to have our full focus back on the stage
again but this these sounds are not the
only ways that these companies get our
attention there are many other ways as
well one of the things they do is the
companies have figured out how our
dopamine systems work dopamine the
happiness hormone the stuff that we make
when we have fun when we make love when
we do all kinds of other things and as
it happens also when we do things on our
smartphones and companies have figured
out how our dopamine systems work and
have learned how to use our smartphones
as pocket-sized dopamine pumps to get us
ever more hooked and how do they do it
well let&#39;s give you an example humans
have an inherent nature to create order
right when you clean your room when you
tidy your desk you make a nice little
burst of dopamine and these companies
know this so what do they do on your
home screen they disturb this order with
push noise messages so by the time you
click the push message you create order
and you get a nice little rush of
dopamine and do you think it&#39;s a
coincidence that these push messages are
read are naturally pre-programmed color
of alarm the color of blood it&#39;s not a
coincidence it&#39;s been tested and this is
why they&#39;re there scholar and this app
right behind me snapchat they play into
all kinds of other psychological
mechanisms this is a function called
snap streaks which lets users know how
many days in a row they&#39;ve been snapping
playing into our psychological need to
create needs orderly rows of numbers and
to play games and how about these
mentions that you get in Facebook or
Twitter do you think it&#39;s a coincidence
that when you open the app there&#39;s a
slight lag between the time you open the
app and you actually see the number of
mentions that you have it&#39;s a deliberate
design feature borrowing from slot
machines building suspense creating this
tension and play
into the very same psychological
weaknesses as slot machines do and the
clock in Netflix ticking down when you
finish your episode also that is a
design feature borrowed from all kinds
of other science to get our attention as
good as they can and why do these
companies do this because we live in an
attention economy where every second we
spend on an app is an extra dollar or
euro earned for its maker
the longer we spend on apps the more
data that can harvest the more ads they
can show us and this leads to an ever
escalating arms race for our attention
and this leads to a to addiction
manufacturing the likes of which we have
not seen since Big Tobacco and what the
tricky thing about attention is because
that&#39;s what they target is that
attention works quite differently from
what many people may think we only have
one attention
we cannot multitask multitasking is a
myth attention works like a flashlight
not like a disco ball you can only shine
your light and your beam of attention to
one place at a time and when you try to
switch that bring switching costs and
what do these costs consist of well it
actually makes us dumber that&#39;s very
interesting research by London
University showing that if you do an IQ
test while multitasking that will get
your score down by 15 points which is
the same effect as smoking weed and the
other tricky part as with attention is
that attention works like a muscle the
more you use it the stronger it gets and
the less you use it the weaker it gets
and this leads to a very interesting
fact because it now becomes in the
interest of the big companies like
Google like Facebook to make our
attention muscles as weak as they can as
weak as possible because when you&#39;re
distracted you&#39;re even easily distracted
it&#39;s a vicious cycle if this sounds like
a conspiracy theory it really is not
these companies do this in plain sight
they are not even secretive about it
they openly am proud and proudly hold
conference about this they organize TED
talks about this day
published books about this this is
actually a screenshot from the summit in
Silicon Valley which is a yearly event
called the habit summit of course they
wouldn&#39;t call it the addiction summit
because that would sound too harsh but
that&#39;s exactly what they are
manufacturing at these summits they&#39;re
exchanging tricks and you can see on the
slide they&#39;re talking about the nucleus
accumbens which is a part of the brain
that triggers the dopamine releases and
where does this end well I work in media
and I&#39;ve seen media changed quite badly
over the last few years where even
serious media have succumbed to sending
out push notifications and not only for
breaking news I myself might have
written some clickbait headlines as well
although I&#39;ve never had a scoop quite
like this one before but we see where
this is headed and we see what happens
if also communicating presidential
policy becomes part of this attention
economy and we&#39;ve seen just this week
with the investigation in in the US
Congress about Facebook and the u.s.
elections what happens if our democracy
becomes part of this attention economy
it&#39;s bad it&#39;s a bad deal and it&#39;s bad
for civic society so what to do well
there&#39;s good news too because remember
that attention works like a muscle we
can retrain it and every the way even
the weakest muscles can be retrained to
Men&#39;s Health cover material so that&#39;s
exactly what we should do we should
focus again learn how to be attentive
and why not start by creating spaces for
focus like our bedroom I&#39;ve strictly
banned screens from mine and it&#39;s bliss
I can recommend it to anybody we
actually read we actually talk we
actually sleep and we actually do not
reach for a smartphones the very first
thing in the morning and and here&#39;s the
smart part there&#39;s really smart settings
hidden inside your phone that you can
use in your own benefit there&#39;s a
setting hidden that lets you let you put
your screen to black and whites to make
your phone artificially boring and at
least those red push messages won&#39;t
bother you anymore
get rid of push notifications turn them
all off get rid of the most
attention-grabbing apps it&#39;s going to
take some changing of behavior it&#39;s
going to take some experimentation but
from now on I think it&#39;s really
important that we start paying more
attention to our attention thank you
