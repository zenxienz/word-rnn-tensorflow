1.7 million that&#39;s the number of people
with a lower leg amputation today how
many of those people currently use a
prosthetic device a mere 1/10 despite
the significant technological
advancements in robotics computing and
mechanical interfacing over the last
couple of decades why is it that nearly
90% of amputees today
aren&#39;t wearing a prosthetic leg and able
to walk around in fact the rejection
rate of prosthesis hasn&#39;t declined
significantly in the last 25 years what
have we missed in the field of
prosthetic development if we take a look
at the progression of prosthesis we see
quite some advancement back in the 1800s
we had a simple wooden leg that could
bear the weight of a patient today we
have sophisticated powered devices some
even reduced the energy cost from
walking now turning to the amputation
paradigm we see from a civil war
textbook that a surgeon would basically
make a cut at the site of amputation cut
through the muscles through the bone
basically wrap whatever was left inside
the skin frankly a pretty crude
procedure and what do we see in the
current day well basically the exact
same thing ladies and gentlemen in
nearly 200 years the amputation paradigm
hasn&#39;t significantly changed we&#39;re
trying to use an outdated surgery to
interface the human body with some of
the most advanced machines available now
the current surgery leaves many pain
points firstly it cuts nerves and leaves
them basically dangling that then become
inflamed and turned into painful
neuromas making it hard to wear a socket
it also takes the muscles and disorderly
wraps them making it difficult to draw
I&#39;ve robust control signals to drive a
prosthesis but perhaps most importantly
the current surgical paradigm destroys
the capability for proprioception or
sensory feedback go ahead and close your
eyes for a minute take your right arm
stretch it out and with your left index
finger touch your right palm open your
eyes now this is something that you can
do with ease without any practice
because your brain is being constantly
informed where your arms are in space
how they&#39;re moving this sensory feedback
is called proprioception and it&#39;s
something that amputees cannot receive
from their prosthetic or phantom limbs
how does the body accomplish this
basically when you move your joints your
muscles are working in agonist
antagonist pairs so when one contracts
the other stretches say you&#39;re planting
your foot your calf muscle contracts and
the muscle on the front of your leg
stretches and a nerve from that muscle
tells your brain where your foot is in
space and how it&#39;s moving but in the
current amputation paradigm these muscle
pairs are disrupted meaning that when
one muscle contracts the other doesn&#39;t
stretch so these nerves aren&#39;t able to
communicate anything to your brain and
you have no idea where your foot is in
space imagine going through your day not
knowing where an entire limb boys
imagine having to look at your hand each
time you wanted to pick up something
even with the most advanced devices
today most people feel that the
prosthesis isn&#39;t a part of themselves
and understandably so the brains just
not hearing what the body is saying now
apart from being a researcher at MIT I&#39;m
also a classical dancer and I&#39;ve had the
good fortune of dancing alongside an
amazing artist and a close friend Sabina
Sabina uses a right leg prosthesis now
dancing is all about feeling feeling the
energy flow through your body feeling
the blood gushed down your arteries
feeling your limbs traverse space
feeling your toes hit the
fluor as even plan to jump this feeling
body awareness through sensation is an
integral part of dancing in addition
your central nervous system is receiving
constant feedback information that
allows you to stabilize your joints move
with dexterity and know how movements
are gonna land say you&#39;re taking a pose
on one foot for example based on the
neural information from those muscles
your body automatically stabilizes your
ankle but for my friend with current
devices her body has no direct feedback
mechanism to establish balance instead
her body and brain have mapped
alternative methods to be able to move
smoothly through movements but it&#39;s not
as if her prosthetic leg is nearly
integrated to be able to allow her body
to automatically adjust what if we could
re-engineer systems to provide natural
proprioception direct sensory feedback
at the biomechatronics lab we went
straight to the root of the problem to
rican sieve the amputation surgery we
take a nerve that would normally be cut
during amputation and left dangling and
we place it into a new home a muscle
graft and after it grows back in we&#39;re
able to read strong isolated signals to
drive a prosthesis these muscle grafts
also prevent painful neuromas from
forming we then take these muscle grafts
and connect them in agonist antagonist
pairs so that when one contracts the
other stretches we call this the agonist
antagonist my own neural interface or
the Amy in my initial testing and
animals and testing in humans we find
that the Amy is able to effectively
communicate with prosthetic devices but
more importantly convey back to the
brain information about where that
prosthetic leg is and how it&#39;s moving by
reekin sieving the amputation surgery
we&#39;re enabling a method that will allow
my friend to directly feel her leg a
method that will allow her body to
automatically establish balance we&#39;re
creating the capacity for a greater
sense of embodiment the capacity to
seamlessly into
great the human body and brain to
machines we find broken systems all
around us in the workplace in society in
government in our own homes and our
personal habits some of these have been
unchanged for years overly complex from
the small tweaks made over time to treat
the symptoms sometimes to really address
a problem you have to uproot the tree
engineers and researchers for decades
entrenched in electronic and digital
strategies have been trying to recreate
sensory perception using those
techniques instead we turn to nature
which has literally spent millions of
years engineering the human body each
muscle for example has these specialized
fibers called spindles that can track my
new length changes and send them to the
brain on a sub millisecond resolution
our nerves are communicating using over
a thousand channels the fact that you&#39;ve
moved a finger the best electrodes we
have in comparison use on the order of
tens of channels instead of going the
electronic route we leverage nature to
be able to reconstitute the
physiological signaling paradigm of
course having to uproot an entire system
comes with great discomfort uncertainty
convincing surgeons prosthetists
amputees physical therapists ensures an
entire industry of people to embrace a
new approach this will certainly take
time and tremendous effort but for the
reward of allowing a previously
infertile tree to finally bare
nutritious fruit I think it&#39;s certainly
worth it I believe that in the future
each person should have the ability to
communicate with their environments in a
way that feels almost natural but each
amputee will find it comfortable to wear
a prosthesis that they can claim to be a
part of themselves we&#39;re redefining the
way in which we recreate the sense of
feeling for millions of people the next
time you&#39;re working on a stagnant
problem ask yourself if you&#39;re really
addressing the root cause or just
treating some symptoms think boldly act
courageously
and uproot the necessary trees to make a
meaningful and lasting impact thank you
