so basically the professional teacher so
that&#39;s very funny for me because most of
our systems and we are textbook over
there so to start with it is to your
safety you know except that is not
sending of an invention the people of
Mississippi
we believe in most of what mankind has
today has come as a result of things
that they create and then later on find
uses for so the cycle was one such thing
it started as a toy about 300 years ago
and surprisingly this toy was not very
different to look at compared to what
you see here now so the first version of
the toy did not have pedals and you way
to kind of push it right so that&#39;s
that&#39;s something that you may have seen
kids playing with even now somebody got
the bright idea of actually putting
pedals there right on the front field
not not in the center in the front field
and well it was a little bit better and
it some people are not very happy with
the fact that you know you can&#39;t get too
much of speed so those of you studied a
little bit of geometry will remember
that the circumference increases with
radius right and so the easiest way to
increase the speed is to actually make
the wheel bigger the limiting factor of
course being the length of your length
right so you had cycles with bigger and
bigger wheels till the time that you&#39;re
almost standing on right though I called
penny farthings by the way and they were
very dangerous machines so cycling was
really an adventure sport at that point
of time and the problem was if you break
your center of gravity was so high that
you just kind of toppled over so you
have to be an athlete and a cyclist both
and that point of time some wise man
came up with the idea of having a chain
and sprockets and that saved humanity
and cyclists of future so so the last
thing which changed actually was the
gearing and a little bit of word about
the gearing so what does the gearing do
in a cycle some of you may have wondered
so is it just a fashion or as some
utility so the human body is an engine
right and those of you who drive cars
you know that the way cars are designed
is that the engine rpm remains the same
so you change gears because you want the
engine to run it the most efficient rpm
so the human legs typically
run most efficiently between 40 to 60
rpm revolutions per minute right that&#39;s
how the muscles kind of work the best so
for example when I am climbing or this
is Gary my friend and this is a pub a
cart which is close to well here beyond
see anger right very good incline it&#39;s
almost 10 percent right and there is no
way you could climb it without gears
right so what you do is you shift down
gears and you go down to the lowest gear
so that you&#39;re still cycling at 60 rpm
but the cycle is only moving at five
kilometers or four kilometers per hour
that&#39;s walking speed right so that&#39;s
about the cycle the history right and
about ten years ago I gave up my car and
I decided you know I actually parted my
father-in-law&#39;s place which is 20
kilometers from my house so I really had
to make a lot of effort to use the car
so that forced me to use the cycle so
that&#39;s how I kind of you know got Dee
addicted from petrol and you know petrol
vehicles right and so I&#39;ll tell you a
little bit about what my learnings or
what my what I think are the benefits of
the site later can I happy alright thank
you so first is this value for money
right so this is a gym that pays you
right so all the money that you save on
petrol is something that you can do
whatever you want with right so the next
is in any kind of exercise right this
you end up doing it better if you have a
frame circle right so there is peer
pressure and there is a social reason to
meet right most of the time your cycling
will spend long breakfast together this
is again pabich got gentleman on the
right hand side is Govind octa he&#39;s also
a fellow teacher he&#39;s the one who got me
into cycling actually right and of
course good cardiovascular exercise
right this by the way is one of the
toughest rides that a cyclist can go
through this is the road from my soul to
you t 36 hairpin bends gradients of 8%
plus
continuously right and it took almost
six hours for us to kind of cover a 30
kilometer distance right so amazing kind
of track so very good cardiovascular
exercise
apart from cycling the only other
exercise which is good when you age is
swimming right so so this is one
exercise we will come to see how other
people are so every year our group goes
to some state and you know kind of cycle
some for 500 600 kilometres in that
state and kind of you know we come back
so let me take you through what is goes
behind planning a cycle trip right now
India is fine larger reasonably warm
country right so a cyclist needs to look
at season before you start planning so
so far up for a pune cur the best season
is winter right for places around pune
and most of the country right winter is
a good season to cycle except maybe the
himalayas where it could kind of go a
little bit towards March April but
otherwise December January February are
the best months for cycling so when you
plan a trip you need to first look at
you you I&#39;m of course assuming that this
is a 5 day 6 day 7 day trip right so you
need to know what your halt points are
going to be where you going to stop at
night right so you need to look at the
map you need to look at where
civilization is and you need to know
okay there are hotels around where you
can eat and sleep the night over right
so sometimes the distances could vary
based on where your towns are so this is
by the way Wellington near Ooty another
factor that goes into planning is the
terrain not India is very flat right we
did an umbrella to Agra trip many years
ago and the only inclines we&#39;re on the
flyovers right everything else was
absolutely flat so that&#39;s a friend of
mine who stays on home and she comes
down for cycling trips and this is
somewhere on the road from Banaras to
calcutta and finally you decide you need
to have trains which kind of hopefully
starts from Pune and kind of reach that
place this is our group returning back
our mysore trip and finally if you can
afford it so this is not really
compulsory but if you can afford it then
you could also have planned for a
support vehicle so this keeps your
luggage it acts as a backup because this
is not our support vehicle that&#39;s Anita
and she had a puncture on the way and
she kind of lagged behind so she took a
lift on a tractor again on the Banaras
calcutta rally right and she&#39;s kind of
getting down from there right but we
usually will end up hiring a truck or a
mini truck or something like that so
that&#39;s about the planning part this is
how we kind of go about deciding what&#39;s
the route that we are going to be
looking where are the stop points going
to be what&#39;s the season going to be the
group size varies anywhere between four
people to about 15 people right more
than that is a bit cumbersome because
you don&#39;t get hotel rooms in that kind
of this thing so now let&#39;s talk about
the journey because you know in a
cycling trip you&#39;re not really worried
about the destination so it&#39;s it&#39;s
really the journey what matters and
let&#39;s look at different aspects of the
journey this is Bonnie Hall
those of you who are good on your
general knowledge will know that this is
where the longest tunnel railway tunnel
in India starts right so it goes from
Bonnie all right into the valley where
kashmiris it&#39;s almost I think eight
kilometers long just started when we
were cycling the tunnel has still not
been inaugurated so I&#39;ll just take you
fast through these kind of photographs
so this is something that we found in
our care large shape very good-looking
truck loading up rubble trees
this is not a truck this is a launch
somewhere on the LP waterways tractor
that I found in the fields in Andhra
somewhere doesn&#39;t have wheels behind if
you note correct just running on steel
this thing&#39;s very interesting contractor
I don&#39;t know how old this is this was
found somewhere near Mysore and this is
the SUV of bullock-carts there are huge
wheels and I guess you know mature
drivers and whatnot I don&#39;t know what
the functions of the big wheels are any
of you know you let me know right
and what do you think this is anyone
know it&#39;s not a food stall it&#39;s used to
carry dead bodies this was in Kodaikanal
you can see it from the thermal okay so
so you end up coming across so these are
probably more familiar to people who
stay in Europe so snow blowers kind of
to clear roads in the Himalayas a
Woodley Davidson the most eco-friendly
harley-davidson that I&#39;ve ever seen
somewhere in Kerala and of course that&#39;s
yours truly trying to take a different
kind of selfie on the you take heart
that&#39;s hairpin Bend number three or four
which is kind of you know almost at the
end of the journey is kind of right so
that&#39;s one so you look at the road you
look at things on the road so that&#39;s the
first thing that you obviously do in a
cycle journey a little bit of an
introduction on the you know food part
so this is from the time that I used to
drink chai nowadays I don&#39;t so
interesting things that you come across
is why does water be pink you know
drinking water is pink in Kerala and you
wonder why of course I&#39;m not getting too
much into that I don&#39;t know how they
make this coffee but it tastes quite
awesome that&#39;s what my friends told me
this one is an interesting idea that I
found somewhere near Rajahmundry right
so as you can see there&#39;s a guy who&#39;s
actually got sugar cane crushing juice
making stuff and he&#39;s inside a mosquito
net right so this is to ensure that the
hygiene is in and the Flies are out and
there&#39;s a small window inside the net
through which the money exchange and the
juice exchange happens right so this was
I thought an amazing kind of jihad that
only Indians can probably think of
another interesting thing that I found
in one of the restaurants that we ate in
so you are a wash basin which is kind of
semicircular so that you know the food
all kind of comes down and it&#39;s easier
to clean probably right so yeah this is
something before in Assam
right now now the two eggs inside that
bowl right and so most of you might
think that one of them is a DC egg the
other is the V DC egg right so I asked
the guy who was preparing this boiled
egg for us it said what&#39;s the difference
any of you in guess what the difference
between the two is duck and hen ok any
other ideas boil and raw is the right
answer
very good so big hand for whoever said
that so so what the guy does that&#39;s a
raw egg and that&#39;s a boiled egg and he
puts tripe at the inside when he&#39;s
boiling correct so he can differentiate
between what is to be served to
customers and what is not to be served
to customers okay
I&#39;ll rescue to you so this is on the
moon our road which we did last year
right it&#39;s just a few photographs
somewhere on the go of course there&#39;s a
crabs point of view moon are again very
interesting rock formation near Searcy
in Karnataka not very far from Goa can
any of you guess what this is yeah ant
nests oh yeah we got the environmentally
sitting over there so he knows so very
interesting contraption again caught
some very old sissy any guesses about
where this is absolutely right so this
is the maca for cyclists right and and
this is one tree but I haven&#39;t done so
far which I plan to do before I turn 50
that&#39;s in next two years so this is MLK
so cyclists lovingly call it MLK right
manali lay hard um laka dongha is of
course the highest motorable Road in the
world quickly run you through people so
that&#39;s my daughter and this is car being
long you know this is a district north
of the CAHSEE rangas right so that&#39;s
where we were visiting that&#39;s my friend
dr. Amanda Lee he&#39;s in the Limca Book of
Records for the highest number of blood
donations he comes on with every rally
to us he is only 77
so as I was telling you you can do it at
all ages the dermatologist trained who
slows us down because it&#39;s photography
that says colleague there and as you can
see the big very fond of T they look at
the size of a tea bag okay lottery
sellers in Kerala fishermen fresh fish
boo celebrations so these are the kind
of things you can kind of end up seeing
this is girly new dump or jewellers in
Calcutta inside jails and finally
scarecrows right quickly take you up
through what I think I have seen as
interesting things in this country and
this is a bridge which actually grows
with time these are made from roots of
rivers this is near cheer up on Gina
Magali that&#39;s Laurie Baker for those of
you on his fans that&#39;s the Center for
development studies in Trivandrum no RCC
no steel everything break the building
was supposed to last 30 years it&#39;s still
there t-bags moon are they kind of cut
and put it into the bag a shower coming
directly from the stream guess what is
this most of you think it&#39;s cable lines
no it&#39;s actually water lines again in
Magel a cheap device for joining pipes
right soit in a museum
I don&#39;t know what the second hole is for
any of you know let me know right so let
me end over here right so I would want
that all of you should get into cycling
right and why are you waiting
that&#39;s the question right it&#39;s the
easiest thing to do all of you cycle in
your life sometime or the other right
and you don&#39;t need to buy one pickup
there enough unused cycle lying around
right so network with local cyclists
like me right find out what are good
routes to cycle okay discover the beauty
around your neighborhood and start first
of January on a cycling holiday thank
you very much
[Applause]
