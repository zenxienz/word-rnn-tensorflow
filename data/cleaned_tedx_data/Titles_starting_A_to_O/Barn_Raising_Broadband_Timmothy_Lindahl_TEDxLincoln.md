so how many of you all seen the rule
Nebraska wave you know the one finger
maybe two above the steering wheel when
you pass somebody on the road I&#39;ve
really come to enjoy this you know why
it allows me to create a brief
high-speed connection with another
person but when I came to Lincoln Wow
with all the cars I was passing my
finger was wearing out just trying to
keep up I think I found a solution my
friend Amy gave me this I think I can
duct-tape this to my phone maybe write
an app to have the camera detect
oncoming cars somehow create the
ultimate ultimate automatic waving
machine I think I&#39;ve just used
technology to continue building so many
more high-speed connections with folks
think about the light bulb for a minute
this was one of our greatest
achievements in our history we often
think of Thomas Edison as the innovator
behind it but like any great achievement
in our country it&#39;s always a result of
so many people taking an innovative
thought or product and turning it into
the achievement it is now come with me
to the year 1935 when only one in ten
rural households had access to
electricity we often think of our own
Senator George Norris as seeing the
valuing bringing light to rural America
but behind his vision it was many more
than than him that made it happen there
were the neighbors and then the
communities that came together to form
electric cooperatives people came
together and shared knowledge and
created an infrastructure that created
this concept and then an infrastructure
that eventually led to every rural
American having access to affordable
electricity the rural electric system
was not driven by directive but rather
it was built by the folks who
desperately wanted this technology and
they leaned on the ingenious ideas of
many other folks all over the country
they had ownership in the system this
was not done for profit it was done for
the sheer purpose of seeing our rural
American communities thrive and grow
senator Norris has innovative thought
and the resulting achievement became a
foundation to our national success now
come with me to an area where you can
view a pristine sunrise
maybe you&#39;re surrounded by a bundled
life roaming free you look out and you
see open roads without traffic you might
step out on your porch and not see
another soul you can actually hear
silence this is the lifestyle I get to
enjoy every single day that I live in
rural Nebraska but there&#39;s a challenge a
trade-off like in the days prior to 1935
with the limited opportunities of not
having electricity I worry that again
today this high-tech world may be
leaving our ability to enjoy this
lifestyle behind
do you realize up to 40% of rural
Americans don&#39;t have access to
affordable broadband internet compared
with only 4% in our urban areas this is
creating kind of a digital poverty to
keep pace with the rest of society we as
a country are need to going to help
ensure that this is going to be
available to our breadbasket my friend
Chris just purchased a new combine where
Chris sits resembles more of a cockpit
out of a fighter jet than that of a
tractor autonomous steering allows Chris
to have his laptop and other digital
devices in front of him during the
harvest he&#39;s collecting data from every
square foot that he&#39;s harvesting he&#39;s
merging it with other data and other
images he might be working on his
marketing plan or how he might improve
that little area of the field next year
chris is also turning on and off
irrigation systems at other fields all
over the area
he&#39;s maximizing his time his water in
his energy efficiency chris has access
to broadband not only to his home but to
his cockpit and to all his fields Dave
is another one of my friends Dave worked
for a large engineering firm but became
tired of the urban life so you know what
he did he moved out of the city but yet
he was able to continue working for his
firm he videoconferences collaborates
with colleagues all over the world and
does almost everything he was able to do
from the office but now he can do it
from the comfort of his quiet rural home
and he was able to afford a nicer house
as a bonus dave has access to broadband
at his rural home however infrastructure
is expensive and technology rapidly
changes this is a real disincentive for
companies to serve such sparsely
populated areas for example if someone
were to mimic our electric lines in
western Nebraska and run a fiber-optic
cable to every rural house the cost
would be nearly forty thousand dollars
per home not quite an affordable option
and maybe not the best long-term option
to provide all the opportunities that
broadband can many of us choose to live
out here it shouldn&#39;t be a trade-off in
2015 Nebraska agriculture alone
contributed twenty three billion dollars
to our state&#39;s economy our success as a
state has created a super low
unemployment rate which is translated
into the need to expand the geographic
areas for our workforce rural Nebraska
and in general rural America continued
to be a foundation to our nation&#39;s
economy like electricity like
transportation a robust communication
infrastructure is going to be a
necessity if we&#39;re going to continue
competing in this global economy
so I graduated from college in 1995 and
I decided I wanted to come back to this
tranquility but there was a problem I
had gotten used to the Internet guess
what they didn&#39;t follow me I had started
to see the opportunities that the
internet could provide not only for me
but for my community I didn&#39;t know how
to bring this technology to my little
corner I didn&#39;t even know if it was
going to be possible but you know what
my dad and I got together and we formed
a group to tackle this challenge through
some creative partnerships some steep
learning and a ton of borrowed ideas
from other folks I got dial-up internet
to my house
and we made it available to every other
home and business in our community but I
kind of feel like I&#39;m in a deja vu
moment seems like I&#39;m right back where I
started 22 years ago really trying to
find people to come together in both the
rural and the urban areas to tackle this
problem but I think this time we should
rely a little bit more on what we
learned during the lighting of rural
America and apply it to today&#39;s
challenge I think we should call this
barn raising broadband neighbors coming
together to build an infrastructure to
help another neighbor bringing
affordable broadband internet to all
homes and businesses for all of us this
is going to take true innovation and
it&#39;s going to be a monumental task
the economics to support the current
technology are greater than any one
company or any one solution technology
infrastructure is the best investment we
can make and tomorrow&#39;s real
sustainability making lives better to
access to broader economies and more
ideas can make it more attractive to
live in rural America just not too many
more of either better use of our time
and our energy can make our resources go
so much farther some rural areas have
accomplished this successfully even
companies like Microsoft and Google see
the value in making this happen
we&#39;ve even partnered with companies in
our area for our own communication needs
and expanded coverage as a result but to
make this happen for everyone it is
going to take true leaders with this
passion in every community to step
forward and get it started it doesn&#39;t
have to be just your traditional
companies although it could be it could
be your electric utility it could be a
start-up it could even be a company like
Google in most cases I think it&#39;s gonna
need a partnership between all of them
to make it happen
since the urban areas rely so heavily on
the success of our rural areas urban
areas should lend themselves to be part
of this solution as well maybe there are
things that are working in your
community that might work in ours maybe
we can look at other industries and
create a new approach maybe we can pull
all of our infrastructure in a region
and share in the cost but also share in
the benefits and create a system with
the economies of scale to gain the most
efficient use the technology and the
infrastructure to support this as a
moving target and the challenges are
going to be unique in each community but
this is a target worth shooting for our
because our communities matter and the
people in rural America matter rural
Americans are some of the most
innovative folks around yet we often
ignore the potential of these thinkers
to change the world as we know it we
leave so much on the table untouched and
unexplored because this critical
population of thinkers don&#39;t have access
whether you&#39;re in rural Nebraska rural
California or rural New York when people
come together with the sole purpose of
building something that can make
somebody else&#39;s life better great
solutions will result and in this case
we can bring affordable broadband to
everyone who wishes it driving these
foundations can make stronger and more
resilient communities by providing
opportunities such as the folks who&#39;ve
built the rural electric system have
done over the past 80 years we can
continue making rural America thrive we
can create a historic achievement and
you know what we&#39;ll all be better for
this together we can make this happen
not only for us today but for everyone
including our kids tomorrow we can
prevent this digital poverty from
becoming established thank you
you
