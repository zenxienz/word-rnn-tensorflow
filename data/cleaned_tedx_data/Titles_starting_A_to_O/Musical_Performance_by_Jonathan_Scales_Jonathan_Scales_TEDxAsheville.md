perform a piece for you guys that I
wrote for my dad who he was in the
military army he was in the airborne so
he jumped out of perfectly good planes
for living as they say he was in the
82nd Airborne Division don&#39;t worry he&#39;s
still alive he didn&#39;t many jumps but
he&#39;s still with us
had a hip replacement surgery recently
but he&#39;s he&#39;s still with us but anyways
I wrote this piece of music to kind of
depict what it must be like to jump out
of a plane and to uncertainty and float
down this is called airborne
