who in the past year felt like they
worked too hard please raise your hand
Wow take a look around that&#39;s a lot of
hands and statistically speaking we
could have expected that take a look at
these numbers this is the percentage of
the labor force in each country that
feels close to overwork and these
numbers add up to millions of people
around the globe who are close to
burning out so it&#39;s fair to say that we
live in a burnout society and it used to
be that our car was a status symbol just
take a look at this guy how proud he is
these days though in the burnout Society
it&#39;s being busy whenever someone asks us
how are we doing we almost instinctively
answer
oh so busy just just imagine answering
whoa
I&#39;m pretty relaxed actually you&#39;d look
so unimportant and right and because
we&#39;re always so busy with creating the
best resume or building the best body or
getting the most likes or take the most
original vacations we work ourselves to
the bone from dawn to dusk and every day
we end up on the couch exhausted and the
next day it starts all over again with
an overflowing inbox and I fell prey to
this myself
I was completely immersed in the rat
race to endless self-improvement you
could say I was practically addicted to
it and that&#39;s because ten years ago I
had a problem whenever I had to give a
toast at an intimate family dinner
Christmas for example the wine would fly
out of my glass
because I was terrified terrified for
public speaking whenever I had to say
something to a group of people my hands
would start to shake uncontrollably and
okay this was a bit awkward for the
family but other than that it wasn&#39;t
really a problem until I got my first
job and this job I was 20 years old this
job required me to give talks and at one
of those presentations my boss was in
the back of the room slightly smaller
than this one
and he said nothing but a couple of days
later he walked past my desk and dropped
something on my desk it was a book I
picked it up a self-help book on public
speaking very subtle so I read the book
he was my boss I read it twice and I
practice it over and over and over and
slowly but surely my hands started to
shake less and then I thought what else
can I improve about myself so I started
reading self-help books on organizing
negotiating working more efficiently
earning money spending money saving
money working out writing checklist
doing nothing sleeping etc etc I started
improving myself just for the sake of it
and all around me I saw people suffering
from the fate same faith just like me
they could process email at the speed of
light but within a really angry face and
tense shoulders and I was always
thinking about work and on an aspirin
diet but as I said I saw my colleagues
and friends they were suffering from the
same fate whenever I went to a party I
heard about someone else when burned out
as I said a true epidemic so I wanted to
know the course the the cause and I
turned to self-help again and I dived
into the world of positive psychology
and I learned roughly two things the
first thing is that in the burnout
society we view life as a competition
all the goals we are told are worth
reaching from money to popularity there
are always measured relative to other
people so we have to have more than
others second thing I learned it&#39;s a
pretty bad idea to feel live as a
competition because it&#39;s a competition
we can&#39;t win no matter how successful we
are there&#39;s always someone else who
seems to be doing better take a
professional soccer player for example
he&#39;s living the life millions of kids
dream about but he&#39;s probably pretty
jealous because Lionel Messi exists and
he&#39;s the best player in the world
what about Messi probably also pretty
jealous because Cristiano Ronaldo his
biggest rival wins all the awards what
about Ronaldo I think he&#39;s also pretty
dissatisfied because well Messi they
always say mess he&#39;s got more talent so
no matter how successful you are even if
you&#39;re at the top always someone else
seems to be doing a better job and if we
know that cause if we add the exhaustion
of working really hard as most of you do
to the empty promise of success you&#39;ve
got a recipe for burnouts left and right
so we notice now what&#39;s the cure and the
crazy thing is we already know the
answer all the research I read on
happiness seemed to confirm the obvious
we know what makes us happy it&#39;s things
like helping other people or spending
time with the people we care about or
getting into a state of flow that&#39;s when
you completely lose yourself in an
activity I forget about time or learning
new skills and enjoying that instead of
focusing on what other people might
think about your achievements and one
more gratitudes countless studies have
shown that people who value what they
have right now are often happier people
so when I read about this and all the
self-help books I started not wildly and
I said to myself yes I&#39;m gonna change my
ways I&#39;m gonna do it all differently
there&#39;s this list and I&#39;m just gonna do
them all and then two weeks later I had
forgotten all about it so instead of
building Lego castles with my son I
still worried about well working through
the evenings and instead of spending
time with my wife I still check my email
every two minutes and instead of
enjoying the work itself I will still
thinking about what other people might
think about my work so I knew exactly
how to become happy but I fail to live
by these insights and I think that&#39;s
because everyone else the media adds the
race to get likes they tell us to pursue
other goals goals like money or
popularity or power and these goals are
precisely the things that don&#39;t make us
happy so even though we know what make
us what makes us happy we forget about
it and then one day after a lot of
self-help books I thought I figured it
out I think we need daily rituals to
remind us of what truly makes us happy
just like we brush our teeth or take a
shower for a physical hygiene we need
rituals for our mental hygiene so that
these insights about happiness become as
natural to us as brushing our teeth
here&#39;s a ritual that works for me every
day I write down three things that I&#39;m
grateful for and why and it&#39;s become my
deliberate daily reminder of really
matters in life for example here&#39;s what
I wrote last week I&#39;m grateful for
reading stories with my son because I
enjoyed focusing completely on him and
that&#39;s almost always what it&#39;s about for
me about the time that I&#39;m fully
there with the people I care about and
his ritual has helped me see that so I
encourage you of course I have off days
now and then but it made me happier so I
encourage you to find your own daily
ritual could be practicing gratitude
like I do could also be something else
like meditation and then when you do I
think we need to go one step further
because even if you and I manage to
escape the burnout society that still
leaves millions of people suffering from
the constant pressure to perform imagine
you and I are colleagues and we managed
our workload then we still have
colleagues suffering from the threat to
become overworked and that&#39;s because
personal burnout also has societal roots
it&#39;s not just a person&#39;s fault it could
also be something like an unhealthy work
environment so we can only effectively
fight back together so the question is
do we want to live in a society that
works towards a place where most people
feel overworked and worn out in which
creativity is crushed and in which we no
longer have the time and energy to have
great conversations with friends doing
no of course not
so let&#39;s fight back together let&#39;s say
we&#39;re not available in the evenings
because that&#39;s when we spend time with
our family and friends let&#39;s turn off
our notifications at dinner so we can
focus fully on the people were with and
once we figured it out for ourselves
let&#39;s help our friends family and
colleagues to do the same let&#39;s beat the
burnout society together thank you very
much
you
