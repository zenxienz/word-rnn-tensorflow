Africa is nature&#39;s ideal training ground
for future global problem solvers so why
do I say this for three reasons
Africa is big it occupies twenty point
four percent of the world&#39;s land mass
Africa is rich in natural resources
having 90 percent of the world&#39;s
platinum and ten percent of its oil
Africa has lots of people 1.3 billion
people strong today and by 2020 will
represent 19 percent of the world&#39;s
population and the potential to
contribute 35% of the world&#39;s young
workforce now when you ask most people
about Africa they characterize it by its
problems and Africa has a lot of those
problems they include poverty inadequate
food supply inadequate water supply
inadequate energy supply weapons
proliferation and also things like
domestic terrorism as well as
environmental and pollution issues but
what most people don&#39;t know is that
Africa also has solutions solutions that
could potentially be of value to the
rest of the world so let&#39;s explore a few
of those solutions so the first one is
with respect to inter-regional trade and
intra country trade Africa&#39;s
intra-regional trade has been
characterized by marginal success
because of lack of infrastructure as
well as the lack of access to capital or
the expensive access to capital that has
left more than 80 percent of Africa&#39;s
population unbanned
so the solution remember Rwanda water on
Rwanda has built its capital city and
transformed it into a digital setting
today Rwanda is facilitating amazing
trade in his
Africa Rwanda is creating jobs Rwanda is
alleviating poverty another company
called trance which in Nigerian
financial technology company has enabled
ubiquitous capital access so today
capital can be accessed anywhere anytime
anyhow what that has done is changed the
ability for small manufacturers to grow
for farmers to receive the capital that
they need to grow local products
eliminating costly imports so jobs are
being created and regions are growing
I&#39;ll give you another example of Africa
solving its own problems with disease
prevention and disease management in
2014 at the height of the Ebola crisis a
young man came into Nigeria from Liberia
sick on arrival he went to a private
hospital
found he was Ebola positive 90 riyer
unveiled the most comprehensive locally
developed platform to go after Ebola
they leveraged local content local
technology and the local medical
healthcare infrastructure in five weeks
Nigel was able to elevate eliminates
Ebola without the intervention of the
CDC or the w-h-o another example is with
respect to job and skills diversity any
become continent will run into skills
issues Africa has the same issue but
Africa has converted in some countries
that skilled disparity into an asset so
for example in the apparel industry as
well as in the agriculture industry many
companies are pairing the low-skilled
workers or the unskilled workers farmers
and growers
and artisans who make fabrics with very
high technology Logistics engineers
people who understand supply chain
management and financial technologists
and creating this viable companies that
are creating sustainable income and
sustainable economy for those countries
let&#39;s also for example a small country
in the southern side of Africa employs a
hundred thousand people in this industry
it growth from forty thousand just from
a few years ago another example is with
respect to how Africa is leveraging its
diaspora and skills that are imported
into the continent so Africa has a large
diaspora and many of them have skills
that they have acquired from different
countries but one of the things that
they&#39;re doing that is extremely
important is they&#39;re adapting those
learnings and those skills to the needs
of Africa so for example we know that
ambulance services in the US or in many
Western countries are pretty much triage
units that transport people to major
hospitals in many regions in Africa
they&#39;re full-fledged mobile clinics
clinics that can treat and diagnose
communities of people and provide full
health care secondly an inventor dr.
Royer Shula invented what is called a
hospital in a box a solution that is
modular and provides a full operations
theater in a mobile unit or a full
clinical units what this means is that
these are technologies that also could
be exported to the rest of the world and
we&#39;re done in Africa so why should the
world care why does it matter if you
take a minute to look at the chart
behind you what you&#39;ll see is that
issues prevail everywhere in the world
in fact the United Nations and the
Millennium group and the World Health
Organization
with a list of the most dire issues that
will affect a globe in the 21st century
and you guessed it what did they find
they found that those issues were
identical to the issues that Africa is
facing and solving today the included
poverty inadequate water supply
inadequate food supply surprisingly many
of our major cities are food deserts
weapons proliferation in terms of
nuclear armament disasters we just
experienced a few of them and lack of
energy or enough energy supply because
of many growing economies like China and
India that continue to demand more
energy supply so what that tells us is
that the solutions that Africa is
developing today could very quickly
become relevant to the rest of the world
so I&#39;m not here to tell you that Africa
is problem free and has solved all these
problems
no Africa is still a long way from being
problem three but it&#39;s experienced some
very positive outcomes I&#39;ll tell you a
few of those in 2013 Africa&#39;s GDP was
1.3 trillion dollars today three point
three trillion dollars but the big
number is that by 2050 29 trillion
dollars that will be six times faster
than the rest of the world in the same
time period
another statistics by 2020 828 million
households are expected to spend 1.4
trillion dollars $11,000 per household
imagine if you and I got into business
the opportunity that exists for us there
another thing that&#39;s happening is
sustainable cities are springing up
Kigali Rwanda Wharton Rwanda yes Addis
Ababa which is in a theo pia and of
course Abidjan in Cote d&#39;Ivoire another
phenomena is with respect to new
companies new technology-based companies
that are springing up including junior
which
an online retail company that one day
might compete with Amazon or iroko which
is Africa&#39;s number one media streaming
company that has caused Netflix to now
show African movies yes you can go and
Netflix on what African movies or Cafe
Neil that is looking at Starbucks and
uses Africa&#39;s coffee so I can go on and
on about companies that are now getting
global attention becoming global
competitors or having global presence
the other thing that this phenomenon has
really enabled is that Africa has now
generated a band of solution providers
young problem solvers both in the tech
and non tech space that have had this
vast experience that could contribute to
the solutions of our world tomorrow so
Who am I and why am I telling you the
story my name is in Gaza Bell I was born
and raised in Nigeria West Africa I
studied physics came to the universe in
the United States to study Electrical
Engineering I have had the opportunity
to work in both the private and public
sector I&#39;ve also had the opportunity to
work in five of the world&#39;s continents
including North America Asia Middle East
Europe one of the things that I found is
that working with diaspora Africans in
all those countries as well as working
with African innovators and
entrepreneurs on the continent is that
the solutions they were providing were
just as leverageable in the West
just as leverageable in all the
countries that I&#39;ve had the privilege of
working and I&#39;m also right now working
to enable African innovators with the
fund that we&#39;re building so what should
you do tomorrow tomorrow take time to
know that not so far away neighbor that
is Africa
no more parts of its stories understand
it study it participate in it if you can
so that when you hear the sound of
Africa
you won&#39;t hear poverty or lack or sad
and pictures Oh buzzwords like child
soldier Blood Diamond or even safari
that&#39;s a good one
but instead when you hear of Africa you
hear opportunities you hear
possibilities so I want to leave you
with this personal quote the
significance of Africa as the world&#39;s
emerging and longest marketplace is not
determined by what anyone thinks or
permits as a story or even the trend of
any given season the significance of
Africa is that it is big rich
troublesome and solution prone and can
never be discounted as it emerges it
brings with it some of the most
important tools to remake the globe so
watch our world the fixers are coming
and many of them are being trained in
Africa thank you
you
