and then go to the next and then was
thinking again what is this passion that
everyone is talking about I&#39;ve been
looking everywhere where is it I&#39;ve been
doing some introspection because that
was what I was told
by monks and and you know meditation
professionals go look inside so I looked
inside I found a very Curious George
that was what I wanted always to do
anything and everything that seemed you
know cool to him and and and that&#39;s when
I found out that I didn&#39;t need a
specific route in life who&#39;s is that
when I when I turned over and see those
people who were always telling me go
through this path and I asked them man
woman child are you happy in life and
they just look at me with that features
look are we supposed to be happy are we
supposed to be happy people can I have
an answer yes we are supposed to be
happy
otherwise why are we here if I am going
and I&#39;m going to to show you a little
image that you might you know you see

most of the time at 8:00 in the morning
with that you know fresh breeze because
of luck it&#39;s not so much fresh but
anyway let&#39;s call it that fresh breeze
and then you go by and you see people
doing like this so does that remember
you might remind you yes the walking
dead people that go to their jobs every
day in the morning and then what happens
they get yelled at they get scolded
they have deadlines they&#39;re stressed
they hate themselves and then what
nothing happens you go nowhere
you&#39;re in debt you hate yourself and
they continued that rat race for the
rest of your fricking life how does that
make you life I mean some people when
they tell me that&#39;s the rest of your
life don&#39;t know that&#39;s the rest of your
death because life is not supposed to be
that way and then I decided okay let&#39;s
stop the madness I will find people that
are happy I had to look very very far to
find those kind of people because
they&#39;re not sometimes it&#39;s very hard to
see them happy people close to you so
you need to go to those you know the
ones further seem more recognizable than
the ones beneath when I found them we
just ask them one question how do you do
it and I was expecting you know that big
secret or big to-do list as we are all
you know married to that to-do list if
you&#39;ll have an exam you need to revise
this you know the classes afterwards to
do the exercises and you need to what&#39;s
the last one exams with each exams
that&#39;s what we all do right I&#39;m sorry
right all right do you know what
minimalist means what those people are
basically living with less than 10% of
what what you have and you know they&#39;re
living they&#39;re not dead it&#39;s this race
that we have to get a job be a
or something after 5-10 years you don&#39;t
have a car you don&#39;t have a house where
are you gonna put the wife that you&#39;re
gonna marry afterwards that&#39;s how we are
seeing the world see the world as a
series of key stones have you ever
noticed that once you get to a key stone
you get to be happy for just about a
minute and that&#39;s it and then what
happens the next big stress comes along
and then you need to think of what
happens next
and what happens next and where do you
enjoy when do you enjoy life I&#39;m giving
you a moment just to think it over
who can say what you are supposed to do
nobody I went on that tour had so much
fun a no word of Spanish and yet I had
the most amazing six months of my life
before you know going to Russia and
dancing some ten breakdance you know I
was diagnosed with what they call a
stress disorder what a stress disorder
is actually you&#39;re having a physical
manifestation of your stress so I was
basically not able to attempt classes
for a whole year
you don&#39;t guessing you know you know
people that went to preparatory classes
that you in your second year you can go
and do exams of overseas and friends and
whatever yeah sis it for you
