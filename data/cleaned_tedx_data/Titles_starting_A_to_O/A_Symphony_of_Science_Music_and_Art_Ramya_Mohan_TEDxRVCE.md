Oh
this another song talks about
possibilities it talks about
possibilities in the creative mind I am
a medic and a researcher a psychiatrist
and an artist and people are curious for
example some of the questions on the
comments are fortunately heard and I say
fortunate because it&#39;s given me a chance
to reflect and challenge some of the
assumptions that we have befallen your
music and art are you still practicing
medicine
well balancing so many hobbies actually
I do get paid to be a medic and I took
it paid to sing and my information had
sold
have you ever come across in our an
artist who&#39;s a swimmer their hobbies
Edison I like this one I guess there is
it really really isn&#39;t a market for this
stuff these just one thing mmm funny it
is not better to invest it all into one
back
I mean clearly they&#39;re talking about one
profession but imagine this bringing
lots of multicolored talents if only
they could be converted into one single
colored back currency oh how about this
one
Oh your kids must be missing you so much
I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t have much time for
them lay on the killers if the eternal
question really signs the music are they
to categorical entities or are there
polar dimensions of a contingent you can
see where this coming from because
science is about logic it&#39;s about
proving and strengthening the theory
it&#39;s about order evidence method results
and art is about free expression subject
and expansion news to a color palette
and notes to entomb so I give you my
personal example as a doctor as a doctor
may expected to stay behind the scenes
I&#39;m expected to prescribe to heal to
serve and when music and art have met
expresses exhibited and flaunted when
I&#39;m singing a song and there is a
particularly emotive piece in my
audience connects with me at that point
actually that
when the connect happens and it&#39;s a same
when I&#39;m an artist I cannot just when
I&#39;m bringing out my expressions on
canvas it&#39;s my inner mind of canvas how
vulnerable is that so you see art is the
place to be for emotionality and
vulnerability it&#39;s a great to express it
in a culturally acceptable way not so
for doctors as doctors we have a
different norm
doctors are meant to be stoic
self-contained empathy but confident it
silently impacting when emotionality
spending all around here and that
happens a lot with human suffering when
you see me day in and day out doctors
cannot be expressed in we don&#39;t have
that luxury have you ever seen a doctor
laughing or crying wholeheartedly when
there is human suffering in a clinical
setting I don&#39;t think so it doesn&#39;t
inspire much confidence really does it
so emotionality and flamboyance are so
not traits for a doctor to have so when
you&#39;re a doctor by day and an artist by
night and you&#39;re mostly
lit in between these two worlds in
between how does my brain work let&#39;s
take a minute to think about the
neurobiology of the brain so the ability
to shipstead or flip between the words
happens right here in the front of the
brain if the CPU is the executive
director he&#39;s the social moderator she
is the social filter that is what is
responsible for social appropriateness
for logic and for rational thinking it&#39;s
a logical irrational thing now the back
wench assisting the analogy of the
backbenchers backbenches are obviously
college students you know that&#39;s where
all the action happens the disinhibition
happens and that&#39;s where all the
emotions and feelings come out now that
is like our emotional brain it&#39;s hidden
here but it&#39;s somewhere in the back till
it makes system so that&#39;s responsible
for emotional expression management and
regulation so if you have a show of
hands how many of you here thing you
have rational brain ok emotional brain
overwhelming majority ok rational and
emotional
excellent okay left-handed people
right-handed box you ambidextrous okay
I&#39;m I&#39;m thanks to right so you see how
it is in the audience right left left
right right left
two weeks ago mixable emotional rapture
rational emotional emotion rational mix
thoughts so you as an audience are
actually mirroring the fluidity of the
brain so you see my point it is not
about this that is about
interconnectedness that is what the
creative brain does it&#39;s about
interconnectedness but it is not random
interconnectedness it is actually
focused into connecting as that we need
for most interconnected
interconnectedness to help our gray
optimizes potential so how does this
happen it happens with positive gentle
empowering approaches done consistently
and with commitment and happens with
music and art and of course our chances
of success are massively magnified if
there is a scientific basis to that so
if we look at functional imaging studies
the neuroscience and creativity we
talking about functional imaging studies
as in we not just looking at the
structure of the brain we are actually
looking at how it&#39;s working when exposed
to a response or a trigger and
interestingly studies have shown that
when one is looking at an artwork
perhaps enjoying a piece of music right
to the poetry admiring poetry writing
out a going-out a mathematical proof or
even discovering the scientific
principle the same areas of the brain
light up the same areas light up because
it&#39;s perceived as pleasurable at Revati
right so you see how it is it&#39;s not just
about creative arts or neuroscience it&#39;s
about something much bigger
it is about challenging our brains to
think that these are two completely
completely different words because why
the worlds have to be mutually exclusive
I mean picking out of her box an
expression we often hear happens only if
you have a box
routers there is a people to the top
evasion frames of windows and borders of
boxes all these hood limits on our
vision and our ability to the forward if
we allow our rates to we can actually
realize that we have a lot more
potential there people billions of
seeing it with a lot more consider the
analogy of the common housefly which
never gets called quietly so it&#39;s got
sensors all around him in the back of
its head and that is nature challenging
terms nature is challenging our norms
about assumptions about vision feel what
is in front of us and what we see so
when you&#39;re looking at it from the point
of view of the brain the level of the
brain is about transmitting or receiving
from information but think about that
intangible component of the brain the
creative minds and science will not
become something else
it&#39;s about observation imagination
innovation creativity dedication it&#39;s
all brought together by the correct
interpretation at a commitment curiosity
that&#39;s what brings it all together so
what set it off as a child through my
school college years I got boxes awards
for art and music always wanted to be an
artist in a musician and as life would
have it as often happens I mentioned two
mice so I was completely lethargic
until one day I woke up and I realized
that actually medicine itself is a
creative art there is creativity within
medicine and I took that principle
through the whole of my training I&#39;m a
child and adolescent psychiatrist
I remember the incidence of this our
child who came to us he was not talking
at all at school but he was fine at home
we used art as a way of communication
and as a way of expression and we helped
him optimize his educational potential I
work a lot with autistic children Amma
children young people sit at rest
and I have seen personally the positive
the tremendous impact of music on brain
growth in the government
obviously I started to think about how I
can actually apply it logically into my
practice my logical brain kicks in how
can we make it acceptable to the
scientific community how can we do
something that makes it well for focus
populations there was an offhand comment
by a friend that met up many years who
said oh these are two very different
worlds and I don&#39;t know an automatic he
was the gist different perspectives as
Wilson said science explains feeling and
art transmits it and I say it all comes
together beautifully in the creative
mind the first step was researching what
we already knew about music emotions in
the brain and how we could bring it all
together of course there were lots of
challenges and limitations
many of them were qualitative studies
that don&#39;t lend themselves research
population and there was a lack of
standardization for cultures that we had
to bear in mind so we looked at the role
of music in other therapeutic techniques
in self guide and emotional regulation
and we concluded that you know what
brain activation areas and patterns were
closely linked for emotional processing
music and non-musical stimuli and a
combination of these approaches is
likely to support anxiety depression
adjustment difficulties and a whole load
of other chronic stress related
conditions that we come across in our
daily lives it got me thinking about a
new novel model of a multi-dimensional
approach emotion processing and
management we know emotions have
multiple dimensions and we know that the
environment around us is constantly
dynamic and changing so emotional
regulation must as well be a complex
multi-dimensional phenomenon so when we
use a uni dimensional phenomena it is
like a medicine like as in meditation or
music or therapy then it&#39;s less likely
to support the brain optimally and in
some cases may actually be maladaptive
so we found that there was a reliable
evidence base for multi-dimensional
self-guided strategy which is moved all
of these things and Cape was born he
created out the processing emotions a
technique that I conceptualize and we
were very fortunate to launch it last
year at the High Commission of India UK
and we went back this year to launch the
children young people&#39;s version was very
well received I&#39;m happy to say I just
like to talk a bit about the practical
aspects what went into the thinking
behind it so it&#39;s simple it&#39;s convenient
it&#39;s the streets that was the way it was
intended to be and all you need is to
wear a pair of headphones and off you go
technology supported is already a CD out
and we are actually bringing out to that
by the end of the year which is a part
of a health care and integrated
healthcare portal it is self-guided it
is also supported at the same time it&#39;s
multi-dimensional it&#39;s time labor and
cost effective it&#39;s been in its intended
to work that way and it is intended to
support one existing lifestyle it&#39;s
complementary when we look at the
scientific and medical aspects of game
the structure the technique is that a
peer-reviewed research it&#39;s easy to
adapt and scientifically validates and
entomology meets eastern and western
music beautifully for wide reach no
harmful side effects and it can be used
in conjunction with medication and
online therapy chronic stress is
supported by his consistent training
technique on an individual level what&#39;s
really important especially in a
developing brain still having years is
that there is a focus on individual
resilience self-worth and motivation so
creep attempts to cover that and it&#39;s
not threatening
there is no stigma or taboo associated
with it the focus is on sustainability
not just recovery and it is used at
every step of the process for early
intervention diagnostic clarification
communication self-awareness identified
and information the
it supports recovery from both physical
and mental illness and it can bypass the
seitan and media perceptions about what
mental illnesses which is a truly
important aim the idea was that it had
the potential for widened his he
dissemination I&#39;m thinking hospitals
community centers school refuge sectors
and women centers and if you may ask why
hey and though music is not the only
confidence in it I say hey because music
is a jet to empowering positively into
one&#39;s brains into the creative mind so
in 2015 I set up I - London which aims
to actually bring together five very
different words music arts neuroscience
and ability in society and this is
through events and projects on global
platforms and the aim is really to
support international community
development and also to support a
nothing brain I see youth of our nation
so for me the conclusion is very very
simple my science and my medicine have
actually made me a better artist and a
musician and my art and my music have
made me a better doctor and as an
interest and that way have joined forces
to the point of no return we are moving
forward stronger than ever
thank you very much
