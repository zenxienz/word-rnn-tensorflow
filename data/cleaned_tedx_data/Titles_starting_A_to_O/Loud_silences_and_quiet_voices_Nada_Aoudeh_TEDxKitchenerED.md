one of the first things we look for when
a baby is born is to hear her voice her
declaration of arrival that I&#39;m here and
you people are never going to get
another night of sleep again as the
child grows we encourage her to stand up
for herself to use her voice and act
with intention say what you mean and
mean what you say it really surprises no
one who knows me well to read in my
kindergarten report card that I was very
effective in using my voice to organize
and direct clean-up time according to
the teacher my next step was to actually
participate and clean up what she had
missed to my recollection was my
determination that clean up needed to be
fair and efficient and at five years old
we needed some serious coordination as
educators we often speak of how much we
value voice and children it&#39;s in the
stories we read in the posters we hang
in the lessons we teach and the advice
we give and theory we love voice and we
know or should know anyway that children
have voice they don&#39;t need us to give it
to them only to make space for it but
for all our talk of voice we also
message something else something that is
intended for some learners over others
something that stands in opposition to
our supposedly voice silence it is used
with those whose very presence whose
truth whose voice we find challenging or
uncomfortable to us and to the
structures that we uphold now you might
think that this silence hits like in
hammer that it&#39;s somehow loud and evert
and so you might think that silence
found me and the questions of my
classmates of how we came to be in
Canada and
it wasn&#39;t on Camelback you might think
that Cylons found me in the period to
history teachers explanation of the many
disadvantages of being an immigrant you
might think it found me in the chemistry
professors suggestion that really young
arab women don&#39;t need to bother with
organic chemistry when would we ever use
it in each of these moments who you are
and how you&#39;re perceived are visibly
displayed yet somehow that visibility
makes it possible to engage when the
intended impact to construct a response
so no camels don&#39;t swim across oceans
and really I would love to hear your
European family&#39;s immigration story and
it&#39;s okay I&#39;ll ask the TMI questions
after class even when these are not set
out loud the truth is I never really did
address my history teachers bigotry but
just knowing what I would have liked to
say seeing it clearly in my own head
strengthened my sense of self so despite
frustration or hurt
there was this renewed commitment to
speak out to use my voice and that&#39;s the
funny thing about silence though if you
make it through childhood and the
nausea-inducing roller coaster ride of
adolescence with your voice somewhat
intact you actually come to believe that
you&#39;re immune to silence as an adult but
silence it finds you it travels the
length of rooms traveling crawling up
around you squeezing leaving you empty
of word hiding your experiences in the
darkest corners of yourself when silence
found me I didn&#39;t even know that it had
moved in it had colonized my very being
it had colonized my tongue but where did
silence find me in so many places it
found me in the comments that I was
somehow over qualified to teach of
needing to tone it down in the constant
expectation that my face needed to look
more friendly smile even when it was
saying nothing at all it found me in a
class that I was so excited to
take that I was the only one sitting
outside registration at dawn because in
those days you needed to do these things
in person I had met the instructor a
year before at a conference and was
instantly enamored she was brilliant
dynamic outspoken she put into words
ideas and feelings that I had that
whirled around my head about women&#39;s
rights and health that made me want to
jump up like I was at a boy band concert
but I don&#39;t know anything about that
from the first day of class all I wanted
was to be seen to connect I read every
chapter every article tried to
participate in every discussion I
brought all of myself and my growing
understanding of human rights into that
space I was one of the youngest students
the only woman of color and the only
recent immigrant the first time the
teacher was impatient with me I figured
time was a factor she needed to move on
with the lesson but after being
continually cut off attempts to
participate in conversations dismissed
and written work empty of feedback I
knew it was me I was the factor still I
showed up for class I did every reading
every assignment I was a little more
quiet and my eagerness a little more
tempered I roles and loud sighs coming
at me unexpectedly for having committed
the crime of being present for speaking
an unwelcome truth for using my voice I
don&#39;t know what it is that I said only
the sound of my heart Thunder loud and
the lump you know the one that sits
about here holding back the tears of
your shame breathe you tell yourself in
out you wait for the end of class and
you gather your belongings and pieces of
yourself you never go back you drop the
class convincing yourself it wasn&#39;t
meant for you you clearly are not smart
enough knowledgeable enough I&#39;ll speak
well enough to be in such a space
your silence culminates in your total
absence you forget about the class on
the teacher you tell yourself next time
speak less
don&#39;t be so present don&#39;t share as much
you tell yourself these are good life
lessons
do you hear pieces of your own story in
this how many of you have silenced scars
that come from experiences like this one
or harsher ones even do you remember
when silence wrapped itself around your
body
I mentioned this story not because it
was the first or the last or even the
worst of the silenced scars it just kept
coming back to me because it was so
subtle yet absolute it centered an
educator with the power of her position
of her identity of her status in my eyes
that it amazes me after all this time
the shame of that experience the need to
shrink to be small to be quiet
lies just beneath the surface the
changes that came from this on other
silent scars the hiding of my passion
the revealing less of myself essentially
the guarding of my voice and using it
very selectively in professional
interactions disappeared and what came
to be my relationship with my students
at school and my own children at home
there I insisted on space for voice I
used my voice I made sure that the
children at home and at school saw
themselves their stories their ideas
reflected in their interactions with one
another and with me they not only heard
about the importance of voice they
experienced how it can change their
world the students in my class owned
their thinking and their learning and
they could challenge me and one another
to interrogate ideas and actions at home
we read the books and have the talks
have always been honest with my kids
about why the adults they interact with
won&#39;t always welcome their disagreement
why some of their peers got lots of
space while others are punished we
talked about how race and gender class
and ethnicity shaped their interactions
with their friends and grown-ups they
haven&#39;t always had the right language
like when my then four year old claimed
all those who didn&#39;t let him play with
dolls were a bunch of racists but
they&#39;ve always had a keen sense of
justice and they&#39;re keenly aware of when
it&#39;s absent so I&#39;d like to say there you
go that&#39;s the secret recipe focus on the
kids make space for their voice in your
words and your actions but I think you
can see how inherently flawed that is to
have a world full of self-censored
adults who are upholding status quo
structures and saying to kids speak up
use your voice just be aware that
there&#39;s an appropriate way to do that
and good luck figuring it all out the
dichotomy of voice and silence became
profound for me when my older son came
to navigate the difficult terrain of
middle school while dealing with the
overt racism of one of his peers he was
determined to handle it to speak up and
as that educator committed to enacting
voice I supported his self empowerment
we had the talks about what he could say
or do when I comforted him when things
were rough and I thought I was doing it
right but I had missed a few things
first I didn&#39;t see the whole picture the
intentional and sustained string of
incidents and how they shaped his daily
school experience I had missed it in
part because I hadn&#39;t dug deep enough
and so I had also missed how we the
adults in his world were complicit in
creating a context where this could go
on for months I also missed the irony of
supporting this beautiful young person
while being cautious in the use of my
own voice for so long I had been seeking
to make things palatable for fellow
educators leaving the personal outsides
sounding academic and informed you know
earning my place in that classroom that
I didn&#39;t believe I belonged in
so many years before as his parents we
eventually stepped in of course seeking
and advocating for the protection and
care of our child so the ending of the
story is a positive one but the essence
isn&#39;t so much about taking action or
partnering with the school or even
engaging young people in dialogue about
race for me the learning was how can I
continue to support voice and young
people in students when I don&#39;t support
it in myself how can we say speak up and
speak out when we are contorting what we
say and how we sound footnoting every
assertion and parking our embodied
experiences as anecdotal and somehow
dismissible as educators we do need to
examine the voices we hear in our
classroom and reflect on the kinds of
spaces that we&#39;re orchestrating how does
voice come to life in your classroom
what body is that voice housed in what
is the experience and worldview of that
body which are the voices that we
encourage listen to and support and
which are the bodies that we silence and
I ask us in that reflection on the
complexity of silenced voices that we&#39;d
not reduce it to a matter of grit
because it isn&#39;t we need to understand
how to truly make space for voice in our
classrooms and schools and help children
to guard against the silencing that may
try to entangle them we need to make
that silence visible and teach ways to
interrupt it within and beyond school
and that&#39;s not just in the content of
our books in our lessons it&#39;s also in
our processes and our interactions and
equally important we need to use our own
voice to challenge oppressive mindsets
and practices to Center marginalized
experiences
take risks to create discomfort and to
know that the eye rolls and the loud
size they&#39;re not on us when we speak
about an oppression that we know
viscerally that doesn&#39;t reduce us as
people or as professionals and we don&#39;t
need to tone it down or smile as we
speak now this is not to make light of
the real dangers personally and
professionally of using your voice we
have to be strategic but we also have to
be brave we need to live the value of
voice not just teach it we have so much
power as educators our positions our
identities our status can we really
expect our students to bring all of
themselves into our classrooms to speak
their truths to use their voices to
disrupt systems that diminish our
collective humanity unless we are
willing to do the same thank you
