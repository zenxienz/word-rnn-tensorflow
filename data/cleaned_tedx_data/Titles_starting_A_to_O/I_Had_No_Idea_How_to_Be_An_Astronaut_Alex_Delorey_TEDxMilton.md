so the second most often question I get
asked these days is how to become an
astronaut
the first being how do you pee in space
so the first answer the first one is
pretty easy the same way you do on on
earth except when you aim for a big
toilet or a big porcelain bowl you just
aim for a little cup with some suction
on it to get it in and you got to make
sure you clean up after yourself it&#39;s
very rude to leave that stuff floating
around in the space station the second
one I had no idea a year and a half ago
I had no clue how to become an astronaut
I thought it was just like you saw on
the Big Bang Theory when NASA calls you
up and says hey we want you to go up to
space so I just you know went around my
regular day being prepared in case they
ever called and sure enough last June
they did the Canadian Space Agency put
out a tweet and said they&#39;re hiring two
new astronauts and that&#39;s when I knew
how to become an astronaut so this story
starts with a medical I was heading into
Downsview air airbase for my physical I
was down to the top 100 I had applied
and spent all summer getting ready I
read had fields booked I met Hadfield in
person I met Jeremy Hansen and I even
when listed my uncle to talk to Marc
Garneau to try to get some advice none
of them could help me they were all part
of the selection committee but I tried
nonetheless so there I am heading into
the airbase and I see an airman he&#39;s got
a pack on his back and he&#39;s got his
hands filled with gloves and he dropped
his credit card so I bent over and
picked it up and went on my merry way
down the hall for for a medical that I
had no idea what was gonna happen I
watched the video from 2009 when they
selected the last two astronauts in
Canada and I thought they were gonna put
us through the paces we were gonna get
an MRI we were gonna get a CT scan the
whole gambit of it so I was prepared for
all of that turned out to be just turn
your head and cough take some blood
check your blood pressure that sort of
thing the fun part of the day though was
getting to meet some of the other
candidates there was three has three
others there at the same time as me and
I hadn&#39;t met any of them yet so I had no
idea what the competition was like I
went home I was very excited but what
happened I told my wife all about it and
she started hurt her smile started to
grow a little bit she said have you
thought of it yet Alex I said no I said
what are you talking about
she goes remember you told me in
Hatfield&#39;s book it said that you&#39;re
always being watched she goes don&#39;t you
think one of them was a plant and I
thought about it
I got more and more excited my god
that&#39;s awesome you know I picked up that
guy&#39;s credit card I shook all their
hands at the end of the day I wish them
all luck and hopefully I&#39;d see them in
the next rounds to come I don&#39;t think
any of them was but I wouldn&#39;t put it
past the space agency this is selection
to be an astronaut after all so the next
few weeks passed excuse me the next few
weeks passed and we&#39;re getting close to
Christmas and we got a note from the
space agency that said you know the next
round is gonna be very physical here&#39;s
some exercises you might want to do also
here&#39;s what you&#39;re gonna be tested in
the pool on so I upped my gym routine I
was going every day and I picked up at
the pool and I kept going and practicing
exactly what they told us to and then
Christmas rolled around and he told us
just before that we were gonna find out
in late January if we had made the next
round or not
so Christmas comes along and my wife and
I were on pins and needles were excited
to find out about the next round and
then BAM Boxing Day comes and so does my
firstborn son as you can imagine being a
new father there&#39;s only one way or two
ways sorry I could sleep one if he was
on top of me or or two if he was with my
wife other than that I was checking the
crib every three minutes to make sure
he&#39;s safe and breathing that doesn&#39;t go
so well with training every day going to
the gym every day didn&#39;t happen for the
month of January but it was okay I&#39;d
prepared for that we knew he was coming
and I went to the gym a lot beforehand
so that I could miss a few weeks and
sure enough I got the call from the
space agency congratulations Alex here
in the top seventy-two pack your bags
you&#39;re going to come back so off I went
to Quebec we went we were there for both
three four days and we were tested from

6:00 a.m. in the morning until about

10:00 o&#39;clock at night they&#39;d pick us up
we were staying in the army barracks
where they do the basic training for the
Canadian Forces we were tested on
everything we did the beep test so we
run from that point to that point within
the beeps and then the beat goes again
you have to run back and the beeps get
closer and closer until you can&#39;t make
it anymore
I made it to about level 10 I think it
was in training at home I could make it
to about 11 and 12 so I was a little
ticked at myself for not doing so well
but that was all right
I came out of with a big smile on my
face my favorite was the swimming run or
swim 250 meters in under 10 minutes
tread water for 10 minutes and then swim
15 meters underwater I aced it no
problem I was a little slower than I
wasn&#39;t practiced but then again in
practice that was all I did that day
prior to swimming I had done a minute a
minute of clean so you pick up a sandbag
as fast as he can and drop it as fast as
you can and then I had to drag stuff I
had to pick the other things up I had to
do a hand cycle so it&#39;s pretty tired
going into the pool one of the memories
I have though that I really enjoyed was
after the pool we were sitting on the on
the bench while other people were
participating you know sitting next to
one of the other candidates and he was a
little his little down so I said he want
to say what&#39;s going on he said oh I
didn&#39;t do so well and I looked at him I
said do you realize where you are and he
kind of looked at me I said you&#39;re an
astronaut tryouts no matter how you do
here you made it to astronaut tryouts
and so he got a little excited and
pumped himself up and he was pretty good
the rest of the week we got to work
together and a few different things make
some videos and we were still friends to
this day so that was the round of 72 as
I said we were in Quebec we stayed in
the in the army barracks and then they
sent us home and they told us how many
people they were gonna select the next
time but they said that&#39;s the maximum
we&#39;re gonna select we&#39;re really only
pursuing the people that we think we
will hire for the job so I went home and
I knew the next round was gonna be
survival training
I knew this because I watched the videos
from last time and I got to talk to some
of the guys who had been there last time
they were in my group in Quebec so I
convinced the Milton Fire Department to
put me through some training so they
took me up to the fire hall and set up
three different scenarios for me on
three different evenings the first being
a confined space rescue scenario the
second being a chemical spill rescue
scenario and the third being rope ascent
and descent rescue scenario my favorite
one was the first one because you go in
this little box you&#39;re wearing all of
the bunker gear you got your your heart
your helmet on and your scuba gear on in
the back and everything and the box you
don&#39;t fit in it but you&#39;ve got to go you
got to get there they&#39;re yelling they&#39;re
screaming out you get in there - Laurie
you got to save the person get in there
get in
there and you put your head in and you
don&#39;t fit and all you can feel is the
room getting tighter and tighter so I
kneeled back up I said I can&#39;t fit I
can&#39;t fit they said what do you do to
fit so I took off the scuba threw it
through when I went through no problem
turns out that helped me a little bit
when I was called to the round of 32 and
we went off to Halifax for survival
training their survival testing I should
say telefax was a bit shorter we only
stayed there for two and a half days we
got to stay on the HMCS Kingston which
is pretty cool you&#39;re in a bunker with
three other men the rooms about the size
of this carpet so you take your turns
getting changed and all that good stuff
so the first day was survival training
with fire and water they threw you in a
room the room was on fire put out the
fires they threw in a room there was
giant gaping holes in the wall tried to
plug the holes if you&#39;re in another room
there&#39;s another fire put out the fire
the theory in another room and the water
is leaking from the ceiling pipes eight
inch pipes of course this water&#39;s from
the harbor and hellofax in April so it&#39;s
not exactly warm and they&#39;re just
testing you to see how you do
you know they want to see how you react
you can&#39;t actually put out the fires you
can&#39;t actually plug the holes but they
want to make sure that you can work with
the people you&#39;re in there with and that
in a stressful situation you don&#39;t just
break down the next day was fun as well
it was my favorite actually it started
off with walk off this plank about 8
meters fall into the simulated ocean
that has about 4 feet high waves swim
around the buoys and get in the lifeboat
so I was all excited you go in one at a
time and I get to the door I know I&#39;m up
next like alright Delory you&#39;re in so I
walked in turn left and kept on walking
straight past the ladder and then
somebody comes and grabs me and said
Alex here you went the wrong way go up
here so I&#39;m climbing up and there&#39;s the
lead instructor I get up there he goes
Alex do you not want to do this I said
no this is what I&#39;ve been waiting for so
he stands there and he says ok when I
say go you go and I&#39;m standing here and
he&#39;s standing here with the whistle the
timer sorry he goes steady steady steady
and I just say go and he finally says
going off I go and I swim around the
buoys and I get in
the lifeboat no problem at all and then
we went through another few scenarios
with a mock-up helicopter where they
turned it into a mock-up spaceship
dropped it down everybody has a role and
you have to get out safely that was a
lot of fun and I actually got to work
with Josh who actually selected as one
of the candidates next to astronauts so
it was really cool for that and he it&#39;s
also an ex Canadian Air he&#39;s current
Canadian fighter pilot so he&#39;s kind of
the dream guy for me too so we go
through all that all day with a couple
other tests and dexterity tests and
things like that and then came the big
one at the end of the day getting the
the mock-up helicopter the guys are in
front explaining what&#39;s gonna happen you
just twist your seatbelt like this and
you pop out okay good
drop flip under get out as fast as you
can and I knew I heard this was gonna
come because of the video they had from
2009 and I was so excited for it and
they go in and then I popped out and
then they take me to the back room for
the post interview they said how did you
like that Alex I said actually I&#39;m
disappointed they said why I go was only
six seconds I wanted it to be like 30
seconds it really wasn&#39;t that that
challenging for the people for the
people in the room but you know we had
all prepared and trained for that type
of stuff so at the end of hellofax we
got we had our post to exit or pre exit
interview with it with the team and they
explained we can take a maximum of 20
people to the next round
okay good so we go home and we wait we
wait and in this one I knew that they
were going to do some presentations with
some grade 6 classes so I called all my
teacher friends I got all the advice I
could and I went and went to a high
school I went to a couple grade six
classes I did some Sparks and some Cubs
talks everything I could do to to try to
experience all the weird questions that
these kids would ask like how do you pee
in space so then I get the call Alex
come on to Montreal for the for the
final round so I was like alright great
so we show up and we&#39;re all there before
and we&#39;re getting to know each other
pretty good now you know we spent spent
time together and so we&#39;re chatting and
chatting we&#39;re adding up the numbers
talking about who&#39;s there and we
realized there&#39;s not there&#39;s not 20 like
they had told us the maximum could be
that they only brought 17 which really
struck home
I mean it&#39;s getting serious because
they&#39;ve been saying all along we&#39;re only
bringing the ones that we think we can
we can hire and so a meant they weren&#39;t
just dragging people along for the fun
of it it meant I could be an astronaut
so Montreal wasn&#39;t as exciting you know
the good part about it was that we got
to spend more time as candidates
together get to know each each and
everyone quite a little bit better the
cruel part that they did though was they
sized us all up for the jumpsuits
so there&#39;s 15 of us now that have our
dimensions for the jumpsuit to go up in
the Soyuz that don&#39;t get to wear it yet
at the end of it we all went home and we
knew there was one more week actually to
come the medical so we&#39;re all chatting
back and forth to see if they were gonna
bring all 17 of us back or not we have
no idea what they&#39;re actually gonna do
and sure enough they invited all 17 us
back to Toronto for a week in the
medical and this was the scary week and
I said this to everybody I said you know
I&#39;m nervous of this one why Alex why I
said because you don&#39;t know what you
don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never had an MRI I&#39;ve
never had a CT all that good stuff and
I&#39;ve heard all the horror stories last
time they selected some the astronauts
somebody had a golf-ball-sized tumor in
his head and they found it and saved his
life but that meant he couldn&#39;t be an
astronaut other small issues like your
cataracts or your veins and your eyes
are too small washed people out so
obviously I was nervous for this there
was nothing I could do much at this
point I&#39;m just a little over 30 now all
my life is going to accumulate they&#39;re
gonna find whatever they find so we
spent the week there the very first day
that we were there I had a holter on to
to monitor my heart for 24 hours and of
course that&#39;s the day they haul us all
out in front of the press make us stand
up there and try not to look nervous and
then they&#39;d haul us all off into
individual interviews with the press and
things like that so I can just imagine
what my what my holter was telling them
that right that day they were in the
gambit that week from MRIs on your head
CT scan on your chest abdominal
ultrasounds they did echo Doppler psych
evaluations all that good stuff head to
toe I can tell you for a fact right now
I&#39;m not gonna
for the next two years of natural causes
but my journey this journey ended I
guess with a meeting there was six world
class flight surgeons I got called in we
were all sitting in a room waiting for
waiting for our chance to go and they
called us alphabetically so I got called
in and they cut right to it
they said Alex we think we saw a kidney
stone we think we&#39;re sorry we did see a
small tumor on your left parotid gland
unfortunately you&#39;re out and you should
go seek some medical advice obviously I
was devastated I spent a year and a half
my wife was invested my friends were
invested the communities behind me they
were all invested I was upset
however I was excited I got so far in so
close and I&#39;ve got two friends now that
I can call they&#39;re sorry I have two
astronauts now that I called very close
friends and we keep in contact still
every day since then I&#39;ve had the CT
scans I&#39;ve had the ultrasounds and
things like that done I have no kidney
stones so that&#39;s no problem and the
small lump that they found is benign so
I&#39;m gonna get that nipped out and next
time they they call for astronauts guess
whose name&#39;s gonna be first on list it&#39;s
been a year of lessons you know it was a
lot of fun I had no idea what I was
getting into at the start and I still
don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going at the end
but every day I wake up I try to be a
better father than I was yesterday try
to be a better husband than I was
yesterday and I work on my new goals
which are what can I do to be a better
astronaut next time they call them so
thank you very much for having me I hope
everybody takes a lesson of you know be
prepared of today for today for what
could happen tomorrow and chase your
dream dreams wherever they take you
[Applause]
