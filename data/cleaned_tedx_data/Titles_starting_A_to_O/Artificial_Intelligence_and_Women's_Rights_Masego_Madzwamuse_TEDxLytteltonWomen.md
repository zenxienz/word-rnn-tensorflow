so artificial intelligence has the face
of a woman and don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not me
her name is Sofia
and she&#39;s created quite a storm on the
Internet the Saudis were quite Swift
with that courtship she&#39;s the first
robot to be given a citizenship that got
me thinking and for many other people as
well what does that mean for her rights
will she have more rights than the Saudi
women or shall have the same right but
most interestingly it also got me
thinking what does it mean for women in
Africa if she had features of an African
woman like me and a number of you in
this room would she have automatically
gotten that citizenship let her know in
a visa so we&#39;re entering or rather were
said to be at the cusp of the fourth
Industrial Revolution and this is an era
in human development that is said to
blur the lines between the digital the
human and the biological you can think
about it this way machines are taking
over or are they now that is really
scary
and has gotten a lot of people thinking
about the implications for the future of
work the future of livelihoods and our
everyday lives there are many things
that we take for granted when we try and
wrap our heads around this really rather
abstract concept is what does it really
mean
however the everyday gadgets that we use
and I&#39;m holding one of them right now
are embedded or I carry aspects of
artificial intelligence think about your
smartphones the facial recognition that
is inbuilt in there think about what we
excited about when we think about the
future self driven cars
that&#39;s official intelligence but there&#39;s
another aspect of it that is driving
industrialization in our economy
and this is the automation of work think
about automation in the factories in the
manufacturing sector the spaces where
women are most economically active when
you think about that it gets us thinking
about who is going to be losing and who
is going to be gaining it is not the
first Industrial Revolution that we&#39;re
experiencing but somehow there&#39;s
something about this face that makes us
uncomfortable it is the speed and the
pace at which it moves it is the fact
that we haven&#39;t quite wrapped our heads
around what it means we went through the
first Industrial Revolution where we
used water and steam for machine
production we went through the Second
Industrial Revolution that used electric
power to increase production we went
through the third Industrial Revolution
that use technology and information to
automate production and throughout those
systems of development throughout that
progress there some that gained and some
that lost I am particularly concerned
about what it means for the rights of
women in Africa and most specifically
for women&#39;s economic rights the right
and the capacity to participate in the
economy the right to work the right to
social protection should you lose your
income the right to a life of dignity
the right to food and the right to
benefit from the science and culture
advances that we are experiencing and
most importantly the right to derive
equitable benefits that I equivalent
your contribution in your shares in the
economy now when we look at we observe
what has been said about artificial
intelligence
much of the analysis is looking at what
will happen in the formal sector of
employment we&#39;ve had about the
intensification of future jobs around
ICT digitization computers ladies if
you&#39;re still studying my daughter&#39;s in
the audience engineering is the way to
go
think about it however we also know that
what the reality of our structures in
the continent the bulk of the women are
not in formal employment there are in
the informal sector and those who are
formally employed are really at the
bottom of the chain in terms of
occupying and dominating the unskilled
labor force and that is the first line
of defense so to speak it is the first
wave of jobs that were likely to lose
the implications of attrition
intelligence we get so excited about
robotics and its potential we hear about
the medical advances but we don&#39;t hear
enough about what the social costs might
be and who might lose I actually think
that if I look at the analysis that has
been ongoing around us around the
question of the future of work driven by
the narratives within the World Economic
Forum our own governments the African
Development Bank there focus solely on
job losses in the formal sector but when
we are realistic and we look at the
structures of our economies the reality
is the bulk of economic activity is
happening in in formalized spaces on
average the GDP the informal sector
contributes between 30 to 50 percent of
the GDP 70% of people of the labor pool
that is active in the informal sector is
women and most of them are informal
traders how much have we heard about
what the implications of artificial
intelligence and advancements in
technology and automation will have in
their lives we&#39;re having
our historical conversation that is
failing to come to grasp with the fact
that the advances in artificial
intelligence are not as our political
and social adjust as they seem to be not
everyone will benefit what can we learn
from technological advances in the past
particularly the ones that have been
accessible to women in the economic
spaces where they&#39;re most active one of
the challenges that women in the
informal sector face is that of access
to finance and within the technology
space we have been so excited about the
prospects and the potential of mobile
money to open up access to finance for
previously unbanked populations in Bursa
in East Africa on every any given day is
said to move close to 730 million u.s.
dollars on any given day orange money in
West Africa has moved money equal cash
in Zimbabwe just across the Limpopo has
also been quite instrumental despite
that though because of the challenges
that women face with access to
technology particularly smartphones and
also access in terms of transportation
get into the access points where they
connect collect money as well as the
high transaction costs that I deterrent
for somebody who must make hard
decisions between providing a meal the
next day or buying stock for their small
shop 70 percent of women in Africa I
said to not be able to have access to
finance so when I have these discussions
with colleagues the question is but hang
on you&#39;re talking 20th century
innovation go we are talking about the
future here we&#39;re talking about going to
space we&#39;re talking about exciting
technology why
you hung up on what Mobile Money has
done the point that I&#39;m trying to
emphasize is in our excitement we&#39;ve got
historical lessons to learn from and
technology gives us a glimpse into what
the future might look like
not all is gloom there are some exciting
prospects around artificial intelligence
or around the the potential value of
technology there is a very exciting
initiative coming out of Mozambique
women innovators in the tech industry
working with informal traders decided to
assist them in developing an application
called Musa with this app the traders
and wasn&#39;t be upload a list of their
shopping products that they need from
the South African side of the border and
without having to leave their homes or
having to leave their stores the orders
received on the other side of the border
and the shops packaged the goods and
they dispatch them to a network of taxi
drivers who then deliver the goods and
Mozambique I have the opportunity to
speak to one of the innovators around
this and I said to her tell me in real
terms that sounds exciting but what
difference did it make to the lives of
the women and she says to me one of the
biggest things is it safe than time and
we all know time is money right and in
our economies time is money and money is
very important it saves them time to be
able to deliver on the jewels that they
have within their communities their
domestic roles time spent with their
children taking care of their education
needs and their health needs but most
importantly it also protects them from
the potential harassment and violations
that they are subjected to at their
borders which brings me to another
potentially exciting potential of
attrition intelligence it&#39;s thinking
about this I actually wondered what
difference would it make
we said digitized our borders and
replace all those border officials with
robots wouldn&#39;t it make it a pleasure
for travel the robot sees you coming and
instead of saying what brings me to
South Africa well what brings you to
Zimbabwe
what brings you to Kenya it says that&#39;s
way ma&#39;am well that&#39;s an exciting
potential I think but I think most
importantly I&#39;m really thinking about
how we think about digitization
artificial intelligence
advances in technology to facilitate the
movement of people and goods across our
borders so we can make the Amtrak trade
agreements that we have all signed up to
a reality would that not ease the
conditions of doing business for the
informal traders of course and the
reason why I keep emphasizing on the
informal traders is as more people lose
their jobs that will become a safety net
for our economies and there&#39;s a lot of
value in how the informal economy is
organized the solidarity behind that the
dependence on people-to-people networks
on social relations and the fact that
the benefits and the returns our crew to
the house would level where they&#39;re most
needed there&#39;s much talk about how we
cushion those who live lose jobs through
say universal basic income grants but
there&#39;s a question of how do we continue
to protect the potential for households
to continue to generate income that can
be directly used at those at those
levels I&#39;ve talked about the advances
around access to finance and the
potential of the technological advances
the one thing that really concerns me
and I think we should be thinking about
particularly for women&#39;s rights
activists
is the fact that artificial intelligence
particularly in the spaces of the
finance and the banking sector job
recruitment depend on algorithms big
data mathematical models right that are
embedded and laden with some extent of
sexism and inequality and if we don&#39;t
think about what goes into those models
who is framing the parameters of what
goes into those models then we&#39;re
missing the point what is most
disturbing is looking at where the
advancements are going they seems to be
very few organizations and very few
companies that are working hard to
remove the biases within the algorithms
that is of concern to me decisions are
being made about who gets jobs who has
access to finance how much it is and
these are based on income levels they&#39;re
based on where you are who you are what
records are available about you in the
data systems
so with these embedded inequalities
based a lot of people who will fall
through the cracks these are questions
that I think we need to think about what
will shift the needle and I was very
deliberate about this picture that I&#39;m
putting forward is I think a lot of hope
lies in our youth Africa needs to think
about how we take advantage of the youth
dividend our young women are more
educated than say women two generations
behind them maybe three however there&#39;s
a lot that needs to be done in terms of
closing the gender gap within the
technology science and engineering
fields within the computer and
digitization bills how do we go get more
girls interested in studying Computer
Sciences we need to look at that quite
carefully governments and companies and
society all of us we need to come
together to provide regulations think
about what the regulations and standards
ought to
if artificial intelligence is to benefit
us we have to be part of a conversation
of where it goes we have to be part of a
conversation about which industries
which spaces in the economy who would
benefit women need to be involved in
technological innovations they are lots
of capable African women are they this
is required in order for artificial
intelligence and innovation in the space
to respond to the gender differences the
future is here to stay we cannot change
stop the worlds of time however
artificial intelligence could be
transformative but it should not take
away women&#39;s economic autonomy thank you
