good evening
communication is a term that describes
the ways we talk discuss and interact
with each other
however as I have started to observe
people around me on how humans including
myself communicate I have started to
realize like the word communication is
often misunderstood or even exploited
although the verbal communication the
ways we talk which is the typical way we
tend to communicate thus placed a great
value on our life it does not define the
truth of communication no matter how we
speak and what I speak and the ways we
speak it cannot define the truth of
communication because the ways we
communicate are just small branch of
communication and it is not a big
picture at the heart of communication I
believe there should be the
understanding of one&#39;s intention for
that will what lead you to the success
of communication one of the plays I have
worked with is called one holography
play written by Deborah Hoover the play
is about a married couple who&#39;ve lost
their child from Lockerbie bombing
Lockerbie bombing was a serious
terrorist attack that was real um that
mert the American plane an m1 a tree was
bombed and crushed into the city of
Lockerbie Scotland the play ends with a
very significant scene where the local
resident women of Lockerbie and the
mother who lost her child washed their
remains of victims together and overcome
the trauma
well the theater production is not
really a usual way that you&#39;re going to
encounter to communicate
however the play really dispelled
clearly - lots and lots of audience the
message was that if you have a trauma to
overcome you need to confront the trauma
for yourself
and if you have someone who shares the
same trauma or assault who&#39;s gonna walk
you to that pathway it&#39;s a lot easier
for you to walk through that process of
overcoming the trauma and it is also for
the audience and public to intention and
responsibilities to aware to be aware of
such issue and make voice out to the
society just like this ARP is there are
a lot of different artistic
interpretations
that&#39;s just thrown out there and it is
for the public and viewers
interpretation to respond to that
communication one of the painting I want
you to look at is this without any
information about this painting what do
you see do you see just lines or shapes
that are formed there where do you see
like people animals some kind of
creations mingling around well this
painting is called Garrincha by Pablo
Picasso
and it was painted as a response to the
carrion kabooming in 1937 and Pablo when
when the Pablo Picasso was asked on this
painting he left all the interpretations
up to the viewers
this indicates that once the artist is
published it is all up to the audience
and public&#39;s and someone who&#39;s watching
it to interpret respond to this
communication that the artist is drawing
out to you and actually take it into
your life but such a such way of
communication where you&#39;re not actually
given the intention of one like in a
direct way may not seem usual to you but
I swear you have encountered this type
of communication for your entire life
animal communication when you see a dog
wagging its tail what do you see what in
what emotion is this conveying he&#39;s
happy right and when you see the dog is
hiding his tail and like shivering what
do you see what Cleary is fearing
something right
as humans who we also communicate with
gestures or signals I should say to
convey our emotion when someone thank
you to smile emoji or when someone
actually crosses their armies what are
they conveying their emotions well you&#39;d
say that the one with smiley emoji there
in the good mood and the one with their
arms crossed they&#39;re in bad or annoyed
frustrated or even mad emotions well
let&#39;s take another scenario into it
well what let&#39;s say that the one who&#39;s
crossing their arms just got fired from
work
what can you think of maybe you can
think of that he is mad at his boss for
firing him simple right just like this
you got the point right away once you
see this a lot of humans and myself too
often do this and take the
interpretations as they&#39;re expressed
right away and go for our first instant
instinct that although it is a valid
choice and valid choice of communicating
that can often lead to the
miscommunication another way that all
that alters and contributes to our ways
of thinking and communicating is the
light that we have been living in in
other words the language we speak the
culture we&#39;ve been in the environment
within were even a mood of the day
affects us on how we think and how we
communicate culture is the tradition
belief tradition belief and attitude our
behavior that is going through
generations and culture really really
affects our ways of talking and the
language we speak it affects our tone
voice pitch mood and everything I to
experience that every single day in my
daily life I am a fluent Korean speaker
and I was grown up in the typical Korean
culture and as I&#39;ve been taking Korean
to one and English to another I have
realized that my tone of speaking and
the ways I approach of speaking differs
when I speak Korean I tend to speak in
more lower
and monotone way because the Koreans I
believe they do not like to enter they
do not like to express their emotions
more we&#39;re talking a lot in contrast
when Americans I believe this is
something I observed like to express
their emotions or opinions a lot and
more opened way so as a result when I
speak Korean I speak more monotone and
when I speak English I tend to speak in
the higher pitch with little more
exaggerated gestures or tone or voice
well yes this is why we come this can
also lead to another form of
miscommunication because our cultures
are different so what do we do it is
very easy for us to create the illusions
of communication it is very important
for us to think about what the
communication really means I think we
should start up the conversation with
the intention of understanding the
communication first of all we should
start up to active conversation
considering the intention of one that
you&#39;re speaking to you should start off
with conversation with your mind and
your purpose on understanding one&#39;s
intention and not just to take what you
want to speak or express your own
opinion you need to first hear what the
other person is saying to correctly
respond and correctly communicate and
understand their intention because that
is what matters right now as we&#39;re
living in the society globalized society
where a lot of cultures come in and
blend in it is very easy for us to miss
communicate and misinterpret so we I
think it is time for us to rethink about
communication and the core meaning of
communication because I also believe
that as much as this communication is
emphasized on our society we also seem
to less value the actual meaning and
actual value of communication I hope you
understand that the ways of
communication is not just all there is
more greater there&#39;s
better meaning to it communication is
about understanding it is understanding
of interpretation understanding of
perspective worldview and opinions about
each other and if you start to realize
it and remind that into your mind as you
start to communicate I believe that our
society can be more accepted and open
society where more people&#39;s voices can
be valued and heard thank you
