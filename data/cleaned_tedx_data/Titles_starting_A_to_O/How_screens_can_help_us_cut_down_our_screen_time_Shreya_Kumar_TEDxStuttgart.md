hello&#39;s should guard now I&#39;m just going
to cheat and I&#39;m going to ask you all to
do an exercise with me just for myself
I&#39;m really nervous and I can&#39;t deliver a
talk like this so all of us are going to
laugh in the count of three right I&#39;m
gonna laugh out loud and I&#39;m going to
make sure I don&#39;t screech too much but
you will do it with me so three two one
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha you&#39;re
not laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha laughs ha
ha ha good all right
a month back I was traveling with my
family all over Europe and it was
amazing because we were finally enjoying
the European trip that we had planned
long long ago there were a lot of things
that I can take back from the trip one
of those things was memories of sitting
in the cafes memories of sitting in on
our couches and having endless sessions
of child but there is another such
memory that stays with me there was this
one thing that kept happening every day
one such argument one such conversation
which you guys are very familiar with
you constantly argue about keep your
phone down you&#39;re using your phone too
much and you would also feel guilty
about using our phones too much now
audience raise your hands if such a
ritual has happened in your life it has
now why does this happen all of us would
first think about our phones in our
pockets and say our devices but the
thing is it doesn&#39;t really end at our
device a pretty-looking expensive phones
that we buy now let&#39;s look into our
phone
our phones has apps that we use some of
them are transactional app we use them
we fulfill a task and then we and our
transaction we stop using the app and
then we open that up again maybe in a
week or a month but there are apps which
have a never-ending use and we all know
what those apps are so let&#39;s say it out
loud and face it those apps are Facebook
whatsapp Instagram Twitter our very own
social media app now these are the
things that we get addicted to why do we
get addicted to them
ok let&#39;s imagine this close our eyes and
imagine social media apps as a party it
is a non ending party in that party you
can get to know each and everybody you
can get to know their past you can get
to know their future you can get to know
who their friends are you can put them
in your circle and block them from your
circle and put them back in and then
drop them again why does this happen
this happens because there is endless
content available to us and just at the
swipe of our thumb god bless technology
we just have to swipe the way but what
is the other thing when we swipe away
what happens is we hit endorphins it&#39;s
like a shot of endorphin and we want
more we&#39;re left wanting more and more or
we&#39;re exhausted
now if social media is so important
it all comes around to justice and
meaning when it comes to all of us so I
decided to derive justice and meaning of
social media I went around and did some
research on what was actually a
meaningful experience that was happening
to people I went and asked people what
was the last meaningful thing you
remember and they told me that it was
actually
an experience where they were sitting
with a friend or sitting with their
parents or sitting in a nice space
now what I realized about each of these
experiences was that there was a place
involved and there was a person involved
and nowhere was social media involved
and what got me thinking was these two
factors were the most important to give
us gratification gratification over
longtime gratification that built over
over a long time that made us remember
our experiences with people and with
spaces I like to call this sustained
gratification and it is not instant
gratification and instant shot and those
of and off and orphan that you get from
Facebook or social media post
considering the factor environment and
user was important for a meaningful
experience we decided to do an
experiment this was folks cafe this was
in Amsterdam and it was a very happy
affair people would come here because it
was one of the famous ones for the food
for the parties and it has screens all
around which are used for DJing and we
drink for like disco nights now what we
were supposed to do was we were supposed
to tweak around with the screens and do
something special for the users and what
we decided to do was actually create
meaningful conversations and meaningful
encounters in those spaces
now you guys must be thinking that this
is the irony of the situation I&#39;m
talking about meaningful encounters
without social media and without digital
screens but how could social and how
could digital screens actually bring
them about so something like this when I
told you that environment is really
important to make an impactful memory in
our brain environment what about sensory
experiences what was common between the
people sitting in
those cafes where Amsterdam it was
Amsterdam itself so we decided to take
footage of Amsterdam and what was what
was really also really important in a
part of an engagement in a conversation
was hooks these phrases that triggered
emotions in us we played this
combination on the screens and folks
hotel and guess what happened
a usually mannered graceful and silent
cafe became a bustle of happiness people
started looking at these screens and
people started talking to each other and
engaging with each other but soon after
I realized that something like this
happened it was really funny that
environment managed to pull out the user
from his screen and engage on a
meaningful level with the person sitting
in front of them but what was also sad
was that they went back to their phones
and why did they do that not because of
their phones itself but because of
innovators like me like Facebook like
whatsapp now I don&#39;t mean to put them in
a bad light but have we been designing
in the wrong way all along there is this
famous saying in the design world and in
the innovation world users do not know
what they need now what we do is we take
the users for a ride when we constantly
tell ourselves that what we end up
designing is experiences that get us
hooked onto our phones in this process
what happens is we miss out on sustained
gratification setups with use as an
environment that we remember later on
and that become meaningful memory later
on is missed out on when we are using
our phone now
I have a feeling that I make technology
sound bad the entire idea of this talk
was to tell you guys that technology is
the future and you may not like it now
but I advise you to embrace it
innovators like me and my colleagues and
my friends are constantly idea ting an
innovating to make and the environment
around you smart whether it&#39;s their
kitchen whether it&#39;s your bathroom
whether it&#39;s your bedroom whether it&#39;s
your car whether it&#39;s your office
there&#39;s going to be innovation
everywhere and we&#39;re going to use it
we&#39;re going to use technology in that
but the thing is how different that can
be depends on us it depends on us
whether we want to treat all of you as
consumers and customers or users with
feelings and a well-being
I started user experience and I&#39;ve done
it for three and I&#39;ve been in the
industry for three years and I have to
say that I have been doing the wrong
thing all along user experience by the
name suggests that you design
experiences for people for users
themselves and to enhance their daily
activities and their lives whether
that&#39;s you sitting across your friend
and having a coffee that is supposed to
be enhanced you&#39;re not supposed to be
distracted by the user experience but
experience what you&#39;re doing right in
the real world now what I would like to
conclude with three things first of all
in my three years a lot of clients came
to me and told me Shriya we&#39;re supposed
to design a kick-ass interface all the
users should love it and and make it
sticky make it make the users come back
again and again and I was like it&#39;s it&#39;s
a transactional app how can i user come
back to it again and again if he wants
to pay the electricity bill he&#39;ll just
come there to pay
electricity bill see the thing is
stickiness is a Shannon and constantly
saying that the user does not know what
he needs is the charm as well you know
what your name we would not have to
create clever interfaces to get users
hooked onto an app again and again if
the users needed that app on a daily
basis they would be on their app on a
daily basis which takes me to the second
point users you are powerful if you have
the power to buy an expensive
pretty-looking phone and if you have the
power to click on the download button
when you&#39;re downloading an app or buying
an app you also have the power to know
when you need to come out of the app and
when you need to use the app the funny
thing is we users constantly victimize
ourselves me too it&#39;s it&#39;s ironic I&#39;m a
designer and an innovator but when I&#39;m
using my phone I&#39;m like oh my god I&#39;m
just like it gets me so addicted we are
powerful and we need to stop doing that
but what&#39;s more important is the third
point
innovators like me need to start
designing responsibly not irresponsibly
we need to start involving users like
you in our process of designing so that
we get to know what you really want but
until that happens you can be
responsible users you can be that break
in your experience of using social media
for the sake of sustained gratification
I stand here today and ask myself what
is the last memory or meaningful thing
that I did
it&#39;s very easy two months ago I was on a
hiking trip in the Himalayas and when I
reached the summit of 5000 meters I was
standing there without any internet
connection without any social media and
I can possibly imagine that again and
again and relive that again and again I
experienced something so simple that it
wouldn&#39;t leave me and it had those two
factors those two very important factors
that creates such an experienced
environment and a user and now I ask
myself when was the last time I used
social media an hour ago what was the
last post I saw I don&#39;t remember
thank you
[Applause]
