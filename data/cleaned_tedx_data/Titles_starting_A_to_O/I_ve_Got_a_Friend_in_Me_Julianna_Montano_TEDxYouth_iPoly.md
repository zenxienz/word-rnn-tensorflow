I&#39;m Julia Montano and I am the only
child of two protective well-intentioned
parents so when the house is boarded up
for the summer it&#39;s almost impossible to
go hang out with friends so you have to
make new ones next slide
these friends to be exact the 90s sitcom
friends is not only the greatest Netflix
binge ever but it&#39;s also a staple to pop
culture for even kids my age despite
that some of us weren&#39;t even mentally
capable of comprehending the adult
comedy when the last episode aired in
2004 the TV treasure is subject to
millions upon millions of those annoying
pandering quizzes that you find on
social media hit next six times please I
don&#39;t think we need 74 million results
for you to determine whether or not you
like meatball subs just as much as Joey
Tribbiani with that said I&#39;ll spare you
the personality enquiries but I want you
to determine for yourself which friend
are you you may be unfamiliar with the
show itself but with the given
attributes you may find them resonating
within yourself or your own social
groups next slide please
next slide meatball subs amazing so
let&#39;s start off with Monica Monica is
the bossy uptight mom friend though she
is the most accountable and she&#39;s always
there to extinguish all of your fires
Rachel on the other hand is your typical
girl next door she&#39;s presumed to be a
trophy wife but will prove you wrong at
the end of the day with her
determination boldness and confidence
Phoebe is way on the other end of the
spectrum
she is the charismatic loon that we all
find extremely endearing motivated by a
tragic backstory she has a big heart and
embraces her eccentric
the guys on the other hand like Ross is
your typical geek he&#39;ll discover later
in life that there&#39;s more to living than
just intelligence Chandler
is the receiving and giving end of every
punch line his extreme sarcasm is there
to mask his big softy interior and
lastly lustful and trustful joey
tribianni is not exactly the most
intelligent but is definitely the
charming heartthrob that we all fall in
love with now with that said do any of
these characteristics feel like yourself
I personally get the Monica Card a lot
which I don&#39;t really understand because
I&#39;m not a perfectionist at all next
slide oh right
so the real answer is none of you you
aren&#39;t a Chandler or a Monica you are
you and while that is extremely cliche
you&#39;ll find it shocking that a lot of
teenagers don&#39;t fully believe in this in
my personal experience I felt obligated
to be the mature humorless one the one
who always has to confront another when
they&#39;ve made a mistake when I only ever
wanted to be the antithesis of that and
I was fully confirmed in my own
self-expression that I had an eccentric
and extroverted side to me but that is
the very struggle of adolescent identity
you see in an age of internet
personalities faceless critics and
infinite phone screens the desire to be
someone is prevalent and with that
desire we turn to these TV show
archetypes and adapt to their
characteristics hoping that we perform a
viable role not only in our friendships
but also for our viewers I know that
sounds strange but an applicable quote
by comedian Bo Burnham is if you can
live without an audience you should do
it when we&#39;re not chasing each other
around with open snapchat stories
word-of-mouth becomes its own form of
documentation who said this and who did
what is a great influence in the
decisions we make especially at an age
where self deprecation is very very
popular
so with that
the problem isn&#39;t as much to deal with
acceptance in fact in an activity where
students had to rate virtues like
friendship self-respect family values in
order of importance fitting in was the
least of our concerns with that said we
do not fear to stand out we fear that
we&#39;re the ones that don&#39;t that&#39;s a
little bit ironic right that&#39;s why we&#39;re
always beating each other to punchlines
that&#39;s why we&#39;re always creating new
labels I&#39;m this I&#39;m that as if that adds
to our own personal value but in reality
this character you&#39;re making only makes
you less of yourself in the connection
with friends yes friends should love and
appreciate you for what you are and not
what you can give per se that&#39;s why we
may not always be the kindness but we
may be the more reliable one we all have
these different roles to play but it&#39;s
not staple it&#39;s not written in a book
there&#39;s no definition for a good friend
a bad friend or so forth and this is why
we need to put ourselves first I have a
big problem with being myself for myself
rather than others I&#39;m not here to tell
you how to be the best version of you in
fact that&#39;s the very reason why I wanted
to do this talk because I was tired of
receiving advice on self-expression that
was just like be nicer be out there be
more friendly because for some of us
that&#39;s kind of hard I mean there&#39;s
billions of people here and you can&#39;t
expect us to be all connected with one
another in that sense so take this with
a grain of sand you are the only person
in a room you have a name you have
interests but without that what is left
what characters define you
you see we can&#39;t always look to Rachel
and say she&#39;s what&#39;s driving my life
right now this is what I&#39;m going to be
and this is what I aspire to be because
she&#39;s not you in fact that&#39;s not even
Rachel that&#39;s Jennifer Aniston
so maybe the struggle to find new labels
and terms is the very thing that&#39;s
preventing us from finding our own
status and our own name thank you
[Applause]
