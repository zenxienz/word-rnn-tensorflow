bismillahirrahmanirrahim assalamu
alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu
that means may the peace and blessings
of the Almighty God be upon you all
earlier I was informed that among those
who registered for today&#39;s event about
65 percent our future doctors who are
women and across schools
medical schools law schools we&#39;ve seen
the increase in enrollment rates of
women and girls and that is truly
remarkable considering that decades ago
it was not always the case
take for example the story of harita
hurry gia is a top Muslim Filipina who
was born at a time when it was okay when
it was normal to deprive female children
of the right to education her family
refused or did not allow her to go to
school not because they could not afford
the tuition cost but because she was a
woman because they believed that going
to school and providing for the family
these are the rules for men alone and
seeing you all here today it&#39;s a
manifestation that we have come a long
way in that regard as what I&#39;ve said
more women today are enrolled and more
women today are studying medic a
medicine a law school in law schools but
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just your gender
that&#39;s the barrier okay despite the
elimination of that barrier we still
have other hindrances to access to
education some of you here might be
familiar with the story of crystal
Tejada crystal Tejada was a beautiful
and young intelligent woman she was a
student of the University of the
Philippines she was a student until she
was barred from entering the university
because her family could not afford her
tuition
then you have the story of countless
children who never had their day in
school countless children who were so
innocent and who were so young countless
children who had larger-than-life dreams
dreams like our own whose lives were
lost in wars fought in mindanao Wars
they knew nothing about now why did ice
why did I choose to start my
presentation with their stories it&#39;s
because their stories are a reminder
that our rights opportunities and
freedoms today are not shared by all of
us their stories are a reminder of our
privilege their stories are a reminder
that the poor are poor not because they
are easy but because they don&#39;t have the
same opportunities that we have and why
am I saying this because the simple idea
here that I want each of you to get from
my from my simple speech is that
checking our privilege is our
responsibility as a Filipino and
checking our response and checking our
privilege it&#39;s not just about becoming
aware that what we have or some of the
freedoms that we enjoy our freedoms that
others don&#39;t have or don&#39;t enjoy
that&#39;s not checking our privilege
checking our privilege requires a
positive action to actually ensure that
each of us regardless of ethnicity
religion class or political background
enjoys the fullness of freedoms and
rights and shine in our laws to
paraphrase spider-man with great
privilege comes great responsibility and
our generation is not new to inspiring
change our generation is not new to
serving our country
take for example
the story of second lieutenant machinist
illumine a 26 year old registered nurse
and a combatant officer of the
Philippine Marines today she is the only
female in her team and she serves at the
frontlines in the liberation efforts for
our Muslim brothers and sisters in
Moraga City every day she Braves every
bullet and she Braves every possibility
that it could be her last knowing fully
well that the cost that she&#39;s fighting
for is greater than her own and knowing
fully well that we are only as good as a
nation as our freedom then you have the
case of doctors Perlas and sinha linden
these are doctors who died while serving
as doctors to the barrios they believe
that every Filipino deserves access to
healthcare that healthcare is a human
right that it is a universal human right
and you know why
as future doctors you are so lucky for
example for us lawyers it depends on our
moral compass if we do if we choose to
do good or sometimes we choose to defend
for example they&#39;re not so good people
but for you medical doctors at the core
of your profession is the compassion and
the opportunity to help change lives to
save lives at the core of your
profession is the compassion to actually
make sure that the future generations
are the generations to come we&#39;ll have
an even better tomorrow then you have
the story of thousands of those of us
who chose to serve as nurses public
school teachers police officers and
civil servants you know as a government
employee from the ARMM I have had the
opportunity to meet some of the most
honest
and some of the most competent people I
know people who get up early in the
morning work the long hours and go home
to their family&#39;s tired from their labor
but with the highest hopes that by
serving their country they create a
better opportunity and a better future
for the generations to come
for their children and for our
children&#39;s children years from now you
will be choosing what kind of doctors
you would like to be and I can only hope
that in doing so you are fully aware of
your privilege and what your privilege
entails and what your privilege entails
as your responsibilities to the Filipino
people and if ever you get lost
take inspiration or draw inspiration
from our history as a people our history
is a history of creating possibilities
for the next generations it was because
of those who came before us that women
and girls are no longer discriminated it
is because of those who came before us
that some there are in our policies
existing laws and bills drafted to make
sure that there is access to education
and it is now our turn our generations
turn to check our privilege and to build
new possibilities earlier I mentioned
about harita Khadija a toss-up Muslim
woman who was deprived of her right to
education and it&#39;s because it&#39;s because
of the past generations that today she
gets to see and witness her grandson
speak before you all about her life
story speak before you all about the
responsibility our responsibility to the
next generation so when you get home
this is what I want you to do reflect on
your privilege
and think what you can do to contribute
to build a better future to our children
thank you all so much
