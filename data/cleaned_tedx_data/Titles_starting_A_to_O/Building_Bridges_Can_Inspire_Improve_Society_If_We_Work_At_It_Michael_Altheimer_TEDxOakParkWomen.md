I believe society is connected and we
must work past our comfort zones to
build bridges I grew up in a place where
as manicured vibrant pretty I would let
it later learn about neighborhoods that
were sick suffering Beauty had left
decades past this motivated me I decided
I wanted to have a dream of becoming an
affordable housing developer I wanted to
turn these sick building sick
communities around to have healthy
environments on the Crete create hope
where they&#39;re suffering I want to
restore beauty where none has existed
for decades in order to do all this had
to become a business person that&#39;s what
they called it when I first started now
it&#39;s entrepreneur so when I was in sixth
grade I set out to start my
entrepreneurial endeavors
I decided to be a grass cutter because
there&#39;s grass in my neighborhood it
needs to be cut so I went out to my
neighbors and I was quickly met with
objection you wouldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t
imagine how persnickety my neighbors
were about their grass there&#39;s a such
thing as professional lawn care people
instead of a young man with a lawn mower
so I had to quickly overcome those
objections by figuring out how I can
provide a near professional service at
half the cost I was able to do that and
then a mass about a dozen or so clients
when I of which I&#39;ve kept throughout my
high school years my second bridge that
I was able to create on my 16th birthday
I decided to go to a white tablecloth
restaurant in my neighborhood I
approached a restaurant toward Aksum for
a job as a busboy he hired me told me to
come back on a certain day two following
week I came back and the interviewing
process was to be known as he&#39;ll week
and that&#39;s exactly what it was
being a busboy is hot there&#39;s no brakes
it&#39;s dirty
is stressful it&#39;s hell week
so I almost quit at first two or three
days but then I decided to look at what
the job function of a busboy was and
after I looked at that I started to find
in efficiencies most of the wait staff
or Busboys did what I call wait-and-see
they stand in the corner and wait to see
who comes through the door then they get
water then they put it on table it&#39;s
wait and see so I developed a small
innovation within the restaurant towards
organization where he was able to save
on his labor costs by having less
Busboys and I was able to raise my
revenue by managing the entire waitstaff
so now as a 16 year old kid you can
imagine do the math if you have $30 per
waitress per night that&#39;s pretty good
for a six-year-old kid that&#39;s my one of
my second bridges I learned how to make
moving toward actually pursuing my dream
I was 19 years old and undergrad at
DePaul University life started to come
fast I started to become a young man
with grown man bills so I learned how to
buy my first small single-family home I
didn&#39;t have all the resources to buy it
and do the rehab but I found folks that
at the time needed help getting out of
their homes because there was distress
in the actual physical asset in other
words the asset needed to be rehabbed so
I would go after these owners they
couldn&#39;t sell to any other rehabber and
present them with an opportunity where
they keep everything above their ask
excuse me they keep everything below
their ask and I keep everything above in
simple terms if a house costs $1 I put
another dollar and sell it at $3 for
profit they get what they want I get
what I wanted I quickly learned that
without me a lot of these folks
be either bankrupt or the credit would
be destroyed because they couldn&#39;t pay
off the mortgages that were on these
houses fast forward to today 2017 my
firm is now grown to be a construction
and construction management firm we
build new construction houses in some of
the port on quote best neighborhoods and
worst neighborhoods and also complete
investment properties in those same
areas now that I&#39;ve took taking you
through my journey as a bridge builder
I&#39;d like to give you three examples of
how bridge building can lead to a
positive outcome first example locally
gender and community locally there&#39;s two
communities or subset of communities
that exist in the Chicagoland North
Shore South Shore to statistically
different places on the map so anything
that they have in common is Lake
Michigan income employment education
housing race both very very different
however there&#39;s bridges being built and
maintained every day with these two very
different parts of our beautiful city
one North Shore banks and other
financial institutions routinely partner
up and/or invest in the apartment
buildings and provide opportunities for
first-time homebuyers the outcome is new
apartments mean less blight and also
gives first-time homebuyers the
opportunity to create wealth for
themselves and generationally it is said
that folks that own homes can then
afford to pay for their child&#39;s college
education more education means a better
job which circles back to the
neighborhoods creates stability
- there&#39;s several social organizations
that provide mission based initiatives
they range from after-school programs to
voucher programs what this does allows
the outcome of this allows a harvesting
of talent these communities that are
being overlooked have several avenues of
which there&#39;s young talent that just is
waiting to be found
finally Northshore currently is
providing health care opportunities for
folks down the south shore whereas the
net result is access to affordable
health care and then it&#39;s also providing
commercial real estate viability they&#39;re
taking dilapidated buildings and
providing hubs for their offices which
then in turn provides job creation and
viable business corridors secondly my
second example of building a bridge will
will be viewed through the lens of
gender have we seen the movie hidden
figures so John Glenn in 1962 created a
bridge with three women Katherine
Johnson Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughn
not only were there three women there
were three African American
mathematicians and back in 1962 it was
socially different maybe right
hopefully so John Glenn was able to
reach out to these women to create the
possibility of safely going into orbit
and safely returning it is said because
of this partnership because of this
bridge John Glenn was able to
successfully orbit the earth three times
and come back home
which led us let us do the space race
again Steve Russians my third example is
near and dear and I&#39;ll speak a little
bit about my work on this it&#39;s community
bridge building currently our community
is in crisis it&#39;s becoming an island
what I call the world we do well in Oak
Park but 15 minutes away from here we
don&#39;t do so well or we do well then
universe Chicago ten minutes south of
there we don&#39;t do so well so we&#39;re
actually going out and creating
mentorship programs and reaching out to
at-risk youth to provide jobs where
they&#39;re doing everything from demolition
to buildings to security to carpentry
what that does is that allows them have
a different lens of the world they see
folks like me that get dressed up and
teach them a skill and motivate them the
net effect of that is the areas of which
we&#39;re developing are now becoming hubs
for hope you&#39;re taking the worst crop of
folks turning them around and they
spread the word so that now the
communities that we&#39;re working on are
viable why should we care about bridge
building
currently if we turn on the news or the
newspaper we see a lot of non
bridge-building a lot of separation a
lot of breakdown in society and what
we&#39;re about the essence of bridge
building is creating the opportunity to
succeed for everyone
levels of success are different but
everyone should have an opportunity to
win steps of building a bridge be open
to partnership I gave the example of
John Glenn and the three mathematicians
without that openness no innovation
would have happened
think about your daily lives of what
partnerships you can create second be
willing to accept help from unlikely
sources this is important to me because
I&#39;m the only man in Oak Park woman right
right
in the example I gave about the young
youth I don&#39;t come from that background
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an opportunity to create
change create a bridge and stay
open-minded and help me work past my
comfort zones of type of people I&#39;m used
to dealing with
lastly the bridge the bridge building
process is not easy much like building a
house or a building the partners that
you go out and cultivate the folks that
you try to work with be prepared for
failure or obstacles but have a clear
end goal so that you can immediately
make adjustments which leaves me with
this if you want to go fast go alone if
you want to go far go together
let&#39;s build a bridge
