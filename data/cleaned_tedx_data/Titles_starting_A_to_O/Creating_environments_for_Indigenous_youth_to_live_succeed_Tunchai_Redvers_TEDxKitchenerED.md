it&#39;s Lana daya my given name is tan chai
read verse and my spirit name is Baba
McGuinn aqua or a white feather woman I
am den a and matey from Treaty eight in
the Northwest Territories and I&#39;d first
like to acknowledge the traditional
lands of the hona shown a the nish nabe
and neutral people that we are currently
residing on in October 2016 my brother
and I started something called the we
matter campaign the we matter campaign
is a national multimedia campaign which
communicates with indigenous youth who
may be struggling but no matter how hard
life gets there is always a way forward
within a month of launching this
campaign we reached over a million
people through our social media feeds
almost a year later we have reached
additional millions have over 20,000
followers and are now a full-time
indigenous and youth led nonprofit
committed to indigenous youth
empowerment hope and life promotion we
started
we started this campaign because
indigenous youth experienced the highest
rates of addiction abuse violence school
dropouts and suicide in Canada in fact
indigenous youth die by suicide at a
rate 5 to 11 times higher than
non-indigenous Canadians this is a stark
reality and these statistics are
incredibly problematic but what is even
more problematic is that indigenous
youth are the fastest growing population
in Canada
meaning the current and upcoming
generation of indigenous children and
youth will soon make up a large
percentage of this country&#39;s population
if Canada&#39;s fastest growing demographic
is also experiencing the highest rates
of negative instances like suicide then
we are failing as a nation so how do we
change this well we need to create a new
environment one where indigenous youth
live and succeed and everybody is
responsible for creating an environment
where indigenous youth live and succeed
so how do we do this how do we all
create an environment where indigenous
youth live and succeed I&#39;m going to
share with you some ways that we can do
this
but first let&#39;s understand things a
little bit more you see as an indigenous
youth growing up I never quite
understood why I saw and experienced the
problems I did I saw addiction violence
and hopelessness in the communities and
family I grew up in and I&#39;ve had my own
run-ins with trauma abuse and suicidal
ideation it was only when I began to
learn about the residential school but
my grandmother grew up in did things
begin to make sense through my own
reflections experiences and work was we
matter I came up with a way to visualize
everything using the metaphor of a house
imagine I am standing inside of a house
right now
above and around me there is the roof
and foundation of the house this
structure is oppression and colonialism
which includes things like systemic
racism the Indian Act the taking of
indigenous lands and the removal of
indigenous people from their lands
residential schools dog slaughters and
the 60 scoop to name a few
within this structure in this house
where I live there&#39;s furniture
appliances everyday things imagine
these everyday things being a loss of
culture and language violence and
lateral violence mental health issues
and illness stereotypes abuse bullying
trauma isolation and a lack of public
representation these things are a direct
to results of this colonial structure as
a young person living inside of this
house I&#39;m like a human sponge I&#39;m
soaking in all of these things I&#39;m
soaking in everything around me but I
also don&#39;t know how to get out of the
house I&#39;m kind of locked in as a young
person I have some pretty limited coping
skills I&#39;m also trying to do with all of
the general challenges that go along
with being an adolescent such as school
and managing relationships and because I
am indigenous there is a lack of support
and resources and especially culturally
appropriate resources that are available
to me after soaking a lot of this in I&#39;m
starting to feel pretty heavy like a
soaking wet sponge I have just
internalized everything and I&#39;m really
lacking a sense of positive identity I
am now a young person who&#39;s feeling
pretty lonely I could be experiencing
things like
like mental health identity self-esteem
issues I could be having feelings of
shame depression a sense of hopelessness
and I&#39;m turning to things like drugs
alcohol self-harm and suicide because I
don&#39;t know what else to do
I&#39;ve been at this state before and it&#39;s
a really hard place to be and as a young
person a lot of the time I&#39;m feeling and
experiencing all of these things without
understanding why this has become my
normal I don&#39;t realize that there&#39;s this
structure this narrative this
environment that has created the ongoing
context and reality in which I live
however there is an alternate
environment one that is nurturing and
supportive of indigenous youth and is
structured so that youth live and
succeed this decolonized structure
includes things like affirmation and
support relatable role models and the
challenging of current norms public
discourse and media does a really good
job at affirming the negative the
hopelessness of indigenous communities
and youth but what if we affirmed the
positive what if we fostered local and
national narratives that focused more on
the beauty and strengths of indigenous
communities and youth what if instead of
headlines like this we saw more
headlines like this
supporting youth means centering youth
needs and voices nobody knows what a
person needs most more than the person
who needs it
indigenous youth need to know that they
are heard that they are valued but they
are supported and that they&#39;re loved
growing up I had a really hard time
believing that indigenous people could
be successful I had a hard time seeing
positive role models that I could relate
to musicians actors doctors
entrepreneurs
engineers politicians indigenous youth
need to know that there is hope for them
to succeed and be connected to positive
and healthy role models that they can
connect to both personally and
culturally there are two norms that
still exist today one norm makes it
really difficult to talk about
complicated and taboo issues like mental
health and abuse yet young people need
to know that it&#39;s okay to talk about
their experiences and struggles because
if a young person doesn&#39;t think that
it&#39;s okay to talk about something then
they&#39;re not going to ask for help
the second norm favors supports and
resources that are rooted in Western
perspectives but effective programming
mental health and well-being resources
for indigenous youth need to be
approached from an indigenous
perspective okay so if we are all
responsible for creating this
environment exactly what are some things
that we can do to build it here are
three things that you can do number one
learn about and understand the historic
and present context of indigenous
communities while acknowledging the
hardships and barriers that indigenous
youth face today
this means actively seeking out
indigenous authors academics journalists
are
and media there are tons of resources
and indigenous created content out there
from poetry to novels to music to movies
to podcasts to magazines that all speak
to authentic experiences both past and
present even better
visit physical places visit a nearby
First Nation a Friendship Centre or tour
an old residential school number to
actively honor indigenous and youth
strengths this means directly asking
youth what they need giving them a space
at decision making tables at roundtables
promoting youth led initiatives invite
them into boardrooms show up for them at
their events at their suicide awareness
and water walks and ask them what you
can do for them engage with indigenous
youth and promote positive media and
representation don&#39;t just scroll through
click and share posts and articles that
talk about overdose deaths and suicide
rather than perpetuating stereotypes and
hopeless hopelessness find and share
articles that promote positivity if
you&#39;re in media or reporting then
interview youth report on the hopeful
things amplify the strengths and
successes the tribe called Redd&#39;s the
university graduates the people who
create we matter videos what you choose
to engage with talk about and share has
a ripple effect number three support the
indigenous Asian of youth programs and
resources invest in supports and
resources that are specific to context
and identity specifically programs and
resources that are rooted in tradition
land language and culture invest in
mentorship programs work with indigenous
groups to create indigenous specific
mental health content review your
funding models to ensure that they are
culturally and youth accessible donate
to community projects and groups
prioritize indigenous and youth-led
projects and write to local MPs and
national leaders about the importance of
supporting indigenous led and rooted
action write those letters and speak up
more importantly accept indigenous and
youths knowledge as expert knowledge
hold those voices up these are all
things that can be done these are all
things that you can do now imagine that
I am a young person standing inside of a
house above and around me there&#39;s the
roof and foundation of the house within
this house there are things like
resilience pride positivity love
truthfulness strength culture and
language hope representation unity
confidence coping and opportunity like a
human sponge I am soaking in all of
these things this is my reality this is
my normal as individuals as families as
communities as a nation we all play a
role in creating environments we can
choose to perpetuate a negative and
toxic environment that exists for
indigenous youth or we can build a new
environment that honors and supports
indigenous youth and sees them live and
succeed so which structure which
narrative which environment do you want
to be responsible for creating Marci Cho
thank you
you
