it was the summer of 1990 my friend Joe
who had just turned 16 was going for a
joyride with his new high-school friends
to pastime what Joe didn&#39;t know was that
his Joyride would soon turn into an
initiation into a gang Joe was soon
faced with the tough decision fit in
with the gang or faced the harsh
consequences of not joining in Joe chose
to participate in a drive-by shooting
thinking no harm would come from it
maybe a broken window maybe the crowd
would scatter and fear the worst did
happen Joe shot and killed an innocent
bystander and is now in prison for life
I was born in Iowa and raised in Omaha
Nebraska my neighborhood was safe I
could pie outside when I wanted wherever
I wanted and without checking in with my
parents I was carefree during the
summers with my hardest decision being
what color of popsicle I wanted to eat
that day
blue or pink I went to an elementary
school that provided me with high
ability learning classes a middle school
equipped with honors courses and a high
school where I had access to advanced
placement classes my education was well
rounded and excellent to say the least
I never imagined I would find myself as
a junior at the University of
nebraska-lincoln doing research on
prisons and education through my
research I&#39;ve learned that the United
States has the largest inmate population
in the world
we host 25 percent of the world&#39;s
inmates while only having 5% of the
world&#39;s population our 25 percent of the
world&#39;s inmates is comprised of 2.3
million people and of these 2.3 million
people within 3 years of release over
half will be really the average daily
population across 10 facilities is
approximately 5,000 people and although
our incarceration rate is much lower
than the national average the numbers
are still significant with inmate
population numbers being as high as they
are chances are you will come into
contact with a formerly incarcerated
person or someone who&#39;ll be in prison in
the future so what went wrong
the answer is complex but part of the
solution lies in providing better more
equal education to prevent people from
going to prison
and secondly the funding of prison
education programs to keep inmates from
returning in Nebraska our public schools
are funded by property taxes for cities
like Omaha this means that areas with
higher property taxes get more money to
spend on schooling for Joe although he
attended high school only 16 miles away
from mine he attended school in an area
that had lower property taxes and that
was also considered high-risk according
to most researchers schools that are
high risk are those where social and
economic conditions render its students
at risk of failure individual
circumstances must also be taken into
account Joe a young teenager new to high
school was very likely to fall under
peer pressure to fit in and gain new
friends his decisions to hang out with
the people that he did and to make new
friends instead of focus in school were
individual circumstances that put Joe
farther into the at-risk category
another thing to consider in at-risk
neighborhoods is the high percentage of
minorities in the United States thirteen
point three percent of the population is
African American but where prisons are
concerned there are 37 point seven
percent of our inmates are African
American our inmates are often poorly
educated nationwide too and every 10
adults as a high school dropout but when
prisons are concerned the dropout rate
doubles to four in ten post-secondary
education is another issue in prisons
only 13% of inmates have some
post-secondary education this is tiny
compared to the 46 percent or almost
half of our adults who an associate&#39;s
degree or higher in 2015 a lack of
education is a serious issue when its
major causes being the school to Prison
Pipeline this occurs when students and
at-risk neighborhoods are suspended or
expelled even for minor offenses when
students are sent home from school
they&#39;re forced to spend time in their
communities full of negative social
influences not only this but they miss
out on important lessons in school and
they easily fall behind according to our
inspector general of Nebraska prison
stucco burnick students who did not
succeed
early on in school are likely to find
themselves in our juvenile justice
system which may lead them into our
adult criminal justice system in their
futures but here&#39;s where we can become
part of the solutions Doug Cobra neck
believes that if more of us reach out to
those whom we see are struggling in the
classroom and in life great things can
happen many students face significant
challenges in school and in their
extended communities before of us reach
out to them we can make positive changes
a current prison education teacher has
also suggested that we encourage our
fellow students to not only graduate
from high school but to move on to trade
school to go to college or even join the
military
he has also suggested after hearing so
many times in prison things like the
other kids at school hated me that we
don&#39;t bully people whom we see are
different from ourselves another thing
that we can do is advocate for early
childhood learning in Nebraska less than
8% of our at-risk children
are enrolled in an early learning
program pair engagement programs have
also been proven to be effective
programs that provide parents with the
skills that they need to nurture and
promote learning for their infants have
also been proven to benefit their
overall health well-being and
development Sixpence early learning
funder nebraska is one such program
dedicated to providing these types of
services to one thousand infants and
their families what if we could provide
these types of programs to every single
at-risk child the Council for a strong
America did a study and found that
children who participated in these
programs had half as many arrests and
convictions than those who did not if we
could provide these types of programs to
every single at-risk child we have the
potential to decrease our inmate numbers
drastically so what else can we do we
push for programs in prisons to provide
them with education release and restored
Nebraska is one such program that is
already in place this education as well
as improved prior education is the key
to keeping people from returning to
prison according to research done in
2014 by the RAND Corporation inmates who
participated in correctional education
programs had 43% lower odds of
recidivism also offers inmates with
opportunities to get jobs after prison
this is because education and employment
have positive relationship so as
education levels increase so do
employment rates education in prisons is
necessary to make positive changes we
must push for education in order to
decrease the number of inmates that we
have in general that way we can keep
people like my friend Joe from spending
their lives in prison it&#39;s time to treat
our peers like people who deserve equal
educational opportunities and like those
who deserve
our respect and encouragement it&#39;s time
to push for early learning programs and
to join peer mentorship programs and
it&#39;s time to push for funding and
prisons to go towards education let&#39;s
together imagine and work towards a
future where joy rides for kids like Joe
or simply that full of joy and not
tragedy
