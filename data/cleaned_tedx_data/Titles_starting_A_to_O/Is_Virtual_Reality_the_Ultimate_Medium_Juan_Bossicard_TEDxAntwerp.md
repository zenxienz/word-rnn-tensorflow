let&#39;s look at reality ultimately reality
is merely an illusion that is made up of
all the different experiences that you
have so that&#39;s the first idea so reality
using the experiences that you have to
form a vision of it so this is me when I
was five as a young kid I was already
extremely interested in news and also
barbecue two of my strong activity
activities and as you know at such a
young age you are an activity seekers
because you&#39;re building your vision of
reality and for me what it meant being
born in the 80s that was extremely
interested by technology because new
technology were integrated and we&#39;re
showed from time to time so it was a
super opportunity for me to go on a
journey on a journey to find the
ultimate medium one that will give me
opportunity to leave cool experiences to
broaden my imagination so it all start
up with the nine millimeter or the 8
millimeter projector so as you all know
some of you have seen that device I&#39;ve
used it it&#39;s really nice because you get
to capture reality and show it on the
screen the issue is the image that comes
out feels more like a distant dream it&#39;s
shaky it&#39;s a little bit grainy it&#39;s like
a postcard
now the next medium that I came across
that really that I really liked was this
media and I knew he was gonna start a
lot of smile in you because a lot of
people have experimented with that
medium you know why because he was cheap
because he was easy to use because also
the image that came out was in three
dimension you could see things with
volume and fortunately there was no
sound there was no movement so the
reliability of the content was limited
now the next device that I came across
and the next opportunity was the promise
of 3d movies you know I still remember
the excitement of going to the movie
theater for the first time putting the
glasses on you know red and blue and
then sitting in the couch and waiting
for the action to start only two after
10 minutes feeling slightly disappointed
by the immersion
by the image I mean it didn&#39;t feel real
it felt like bizarre like somebody was
trying to push an ID on me and he didn&#39;t
feel immersed so the next medium I had
the chance to try was this device he was
introduced in 1996 by company called
Nintendo he was supposed to have
Ellucian eyes the way we consume games
the way we do entertainments now it&#39;s
also a device that was known to make you
sick after 10 minutes not only because
you had to lean forwards to look at the
image but because as you can see the
quality of the image is not really there
so the next thing that I&#39;ve tried was
disappointment so for many years you
know I&#39;ve stopped looking for the
ultimate medium I mean a lot of new
things were introduced but none of them
really touched me personally so I end up
doing a very normal career I went to
business school I joined a student
organization ended up working for a big
technology company for consultancy today
I&#39;m still advising technology startups
so that gives me a unique chance to
follow technology and know where the
trends are going and then something
happened in 2013 I came across this
device an early version of the oculus
rift for the first time a device was
introduced a consumer version of the
actual reality one that you and I could
approach that was actually practical and
this is what happened to me it was the
closest thing to magic really close
because all the dreams that I had all
the vision all the things that I wanted
to experience through a device finally
came together in one medium and that was
for me absolutely extraordinary and to
understand that you have to be in
virtual reality you have to see have the
feeling to be transported somewhere else
to have the freedom of movements to have
the freedom of using your interface the
way you want of creating of trying
things it&#39;s extremely liberating and it
puts you in a totally different mode
than traditional reality the medium
itself becomes the
and that&#39;s what extremely unique about
about the medium itself now how is it
achieve well these are really three
things that come together to achieve
that experience within virtual reality
the first thing is it gives you
interaction that means you get to
interact with the environment when you
pick a tool or virtual objects and you
move around within you able to interact
with the environment something happens
with that objects so that contributes to
the immersion another thing is is the
great sense of autonomy you get to
decide how you look and what you look
when you watch a movie the size of the
screen is always this thing that means
whoever made the movie has decided to
only show you that part of the picture
with virtual reality you get to decide
where you look you have the autonomy of
your decisions in consuming the medium
I&#39;ll give you one example I was given
the opportunity to watch a video about
Barack Obama talking in the Oval Office
so it&#39;s really good because you&#39;re
sitting next to him he&#39;s talking to you
there you see him in 3d you have become
in a conversation with him so as I was
there and then listening to him I was
that a detail of the room just sort of
took me and rather than listen to him I
was looking around the room and I
realized oh my god the Oval Office
is oval so and until you try them till
you have been in an over room you have
no idea what an oval room is and so that
a medium is trying to tell you one
message and you have the autonomy to
give another message to the medium that
is extremely powerful and that is the
power of VR and then there&#39;s the last
point is really the ability to give you
presence
now what is presence presence is a
simple feeling of here and now you&#39;re
here in entropy and you&#39;re now listening
to me this is presence now to show you
the power of presence let&#39;s watch a
quick video so this is five-time world
champion Ronnie O&#39;Sullivan
and he&#39;s been put in virtual reality for
the first time ever
so he knows nothing about the medium he
has no enthusiasm about it he&#39;s just
being put there so after a while he&#39;s
learning to use the medium he&#39;s been
taught what to use so he&#39;s about to take
his first shot he&#39;s preparing himself
and then boom he falls flat to the
ground now why did he fall flat to the
ground well because for him
virtual reality was reality he was
experiencing presence so as he was about
to take his shot as he usually do he was
leaning forward he knows he needs to put
his balance on the table before be
taking the shots and his brain got
tricked into believing the table in
front of him was real that is the power
of the medium and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so
amazing so I need a volunteer
hopefully somebody that has not yet
tried virtual reality and somebody
that&#39;s afraid of animals so please raise
your hands you you were the first one to
raise please come in
so whatever happens in VR you&#39;ll be fine
we also have called animal control so if
something goes wrong we know how to
control the Beast so don&#39;t be afraid she
will all be fine okay there you go
hopefully we should be able to switch
the image there we go

[Applause]
thank you very much that is the magic of
the medium I mean there&#39;s some other
electronics behind it but it was a
screen in front of her face just like
any of the other screen I&#39;ve seen or
have experience of you of yourself
experience it was a screen now when
Internet was introduced the promise was
to democratize information with virtual
reality the promise is to democratize
experiences and she just lived an
experience she will remember for the
rest of their life now a lot of you
probably have lots of dreams like going
into space or even flying
well virtual reality can offer you such
experiences simply by going to a headset
and from the comfort of your home you
know fly like a bird that is the power
of the medium also social media and
social networks have made a promise for
a long time to keep people closer to a
lot of people to talk with one another
and to interact with one another but
ultimately there&#39;s still some distances
still we are not necessarily able to
share experiences together and what
virtual reality allows you to do is to
transcend distances and live join
experiences with your friends things
that you can live and remember together
another very interesting point is
personal development and therapy you
know a lot of people are working on
themselves on improving themselves and
they have a lot to do to imagine certain
situations or certain activity that they
need to overcome well in virtual reality
you can
Claunch people in certain situation and
have them work on themselves through the
comfort of a simulation and it&#39;s been
known that virtual reality helps people
with afraid of ID to overcome their fear
another very interesting point is
education you know for a very long time
education has been the same yet it&#39;s
been proven that experiential learning
is much more effective than traditional
learning methods so if you put a student
in a classroom and rather than telling
about dinosaurs you have him live for a
few hours amongst dinosaur is going to
be much more likely to remember what
they eat or they leave and and how they
behave as animals much better ways of
learning and activities now ultimately
the promise of cinema was to emerge
people in the action there&#39;s this legend
that when people saw this image for the
first time in a movie theater they were
so afraid that they left the room
because they were afraid the train will
run them over now we all know it&#39;s a
legend but with virtual reality was much
more closer to that to that promise
where people really feel the action they
really immerse in what they see and what
they live so ultimately this is me I
mean that the child in me is still there
I still have that energy I&#39;m using that
passion and that discovery I&#39;ve made to
help support the Belgian virtual reality
community to help intrapreneurs expand
across Europe and I was also recently
able to influence the political agenda
of the Brussels region to make virtual
reality a priority now I won&#39;t leave you
always one thoughts that if you can
accept that real reality is influenced
by your experiences and that virtual
reality can offer you experiences then
virtual reality can influence our
reality thank you
you
