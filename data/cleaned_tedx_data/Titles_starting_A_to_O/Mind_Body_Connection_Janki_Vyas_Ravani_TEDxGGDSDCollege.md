thank you for this honor it is
absolutely fantastic to be here are we
doing good so far
great so I&#39;ve lost the number of times
that I&#39;ve been asked how do you manage
to be so happy all the time how do you
always keep that smile on your face and
I share my secret with them I forgot no
I&#39;m kidding
the secret to my happiness is that I
forget happily its anyways so difficult
to hold on to all that negativity right
it&#39;s very stressful so I choose to
happily forget five minutes of anything
that happens I&#39;ve moved on and as you
can imagine that makes my husband a very
happy man because he gets away with all
the nonsense and I don&#39;t even remember
it so all you unmarried people and I see
lots of you in the crowd right when
you&#39;re looking for a partner what are
you gonna look for don&#39;t go for the
degrees or the money or the looks only
okay
go check the horoscope do a memory test
the worse the memory the happier your
marriage
believe me learn from me okay so before
we move on I want to do a quick
cleanliness check yes cleanliness check
I&#39;m a swatch bharat&#39; supporter I&#39;m doing
my bit today so let me know if you do
all these things every day right do you
clean your house your car even your
mobile phone the junk files you bathe
every day right hang on why do we do
these things we do these things so that
we can keep our body or a home liveable
efficient healthy right what about
inside us do we clean up internally at
least consciously what about here in the
mind do we clean it every day no why not
why don&#39;t we clean up every day because
we don&#39;t even realize that we are
collecting garbage shell
do you think we&#39;re collecting garbage
yeah very good do you do anything about
it no okay we don&#39;t do anything about it
because we don&#39;t even realize that that
garbage is becoming toxic it&#39;s decaying
and it&#39;s affecting your body when we
feel bad when we&#39;re holding on to
negative emotions definitely we were not
doing so good here well you know what
those negative emotions that you&#39;re
holding on to the hurt the guilt the
shame the criticism the stress all of
that is also affecting your physical
body so I had a friend who came in the
other day and she was telling me you
know what I&#39;ve had the stomach bug for a
year now every month I fall ill stomach
infection every other month for one
whole year is that normal
no she&#39;s been to the doctors she&#39;s been
taking her medicines her reports are all
clear so I asked her is there something
going on in your life that you&#39;re not
able to digest and she said no Agyei I&#39;m
doing good
there&#39;s nothing wrong in my life there&#39;s
nothing bothering me and that is her
conscious mind talking what is the
conscious mind the conscious mind is
that part of your mind which thinks
analyzes needs logic takes decisions is
organized plans thinks of the future
looks for information takes all those
well informed decisions to make you
happy but you know what here&#39;s the sad
part that conscious mind is only 10 to
12 percent of your mind
88 to 90 percent of your mind
is the subconscious mind we all know
it&#39;s very powerful right the power of
the subconscious mind but you know what
the subconscious mind doesn&#39;t think so
much it&#39;s not so intelligent it just
feels
so for every little thing that happens
your subconscious mind checks how did
this event make me feel today it records
every minute of your life literally
every minute during sessions we go back
to the time where a person was in their
womb in the mother&#39;s womb and those
memories are troubling them today
because they left them unresolved so
your subconscious mind you think of it
as a record keeper who feels so let&#39;s
see for smoking okay your conscious mind
tells you smoking is bad focus here how
many times have you tried to quit lost
count right your conscious mind tells
you smoking is bad it harms the body
it&#39;ll give you cancer it&#39;ll even kill
you someday but what is the subconscious
mind or does the subconscious mind think
so much the subconscious mind says how
did smoking make me feel and you know
what he says it says give me a kick made
me look cool I&#39;m the dude help me
relieve my stress when I was bored and I
smoked it felt good so what is that
message that the record keeper writes
there smoking is good which is why when
you try to quit smoking what happens
what do you think happens in the
tug-of-war between these two no points
for guessing right that&#39;s why it&#39;s so
difficult to quit now every time you
hold on every time you have something
that makes you sad upset or stressed
what happens is your subconscious mind
has stored and recorded all these things
which is why when all you young kids go
through heartbreak or failure and all of
us when we go through all that
consciously you say forget it I&#39;m gonna
get over it I&#39;m not gonna think about
that again and let it make me sad but
you know what that&#39;s 10% of your mind
talking 90% you see that guy there he&#39;s
sitting there like that not will
to budge not willing to let go of any of
those negative feelings you&#39;re hurt
criticism heartbreak guilt anger you
have to convince him to move only then
can you make that change in your life
because that is the power of your
subconscious mind now all these negative
things that you hold on to is physically
affecting your body the thoughts the
feelings are intangible they are here
they are here but they affect your body
do you believe me good but you shouldn&#39;t
not until you get proof right remember
that when you hear something you always
want to know how to prove it is it true
so what a scientific research same and
there&#39;s a lot of it available or believe
me research says that people who have
emotional support in friends and a
family or have a partner are at a
one-third lesser risk of heart disease
than others depression people who are
depressed it is more dangerous the
depression is more dangerous for their
body than smoking or drinking people who
meditate and keep their mind calm and
team are at a 55% lesser risk of getting
cancer than those who don&#39;t and here&#39;s
my favorite part
happy people lives seven to ten years
longer than unhappy people
so all those intangible thoughts so when
you&#39;re happy it&#39;s a state of mind right
but when you&#39;re happy the happy hormones
are released in the body which keep you
healthy when you are unhappy all the
stress hormones that are released
actually affect your health even the
common language that we talk will
actually give you insights into this but
it&#39;s only so common that we don&#39;t pay
attention you know to Express sometimes
how you say I was so scared I peed in my
pants your fear is affecting the kidneys
or when you&#39;re hungry you say my blood
is boiling
my heart broke I can feel it in my bones
you know you know those emotions you say
they are affecting your body but you&#39;re
not paying attention but your body is
always listening and responding to all
those thoughts so let me share an
example with you there was this lady in
her 50s 60s of him to me
with a corona case of acidity now you
might be thinking that your happiness
coach why somebody with acidity coming
to you all right so it seems she
attended one of my awareness talks where
I was talking about the mind-body
connection and she figured that she has
certainty since five years every single
day burning her from with him she had
been to doctors taken out all her
reports everything was clear there was
nothing wrong physically technically
nothing wrong but he was still going on
and that medicines were only giving her
temporary relief when she came to me for
therapy and we started working on her
she regressed to a time where she was a
new mother she&#39;s live in a joint family
lots of housework lots of
responsibilities and in that face she
had neglected her child she was feeling
bad about it but at that point she
couldn&#39;t do anything but that guilt she
held on to it I&#39;m a bad mother how can I
be doing this to my child I&#39;ve even
spanked her so many times and that guilt
was eating her from with him and it&#39;s
not surprising because your body is
always listening to your thoughts so if
you have that constant record going on
in your subconscious mind which says
your body which says I&#39;m bad I&#39;m bad I
hate myself you&#39;re criticizing yourself
you&#39;re feeling guilty you know how you
say that guilt was burning me from
within it literally was and it
manifested as her acidity when we
resolved it when we helped her make
peace with that not surprising
she got long term relief from that
acidity and this is just one case there
account
clients come to me with chronic shoulder
aches back aches knee pains all because
they&#39;re leaving something unresolved in
their mind something as simple as
worrying about the future taking too
much stress about it can give you
shoulder aches because you&#39;re thinking
of it as a burden let see the language
of your mind is very important because
your body is listening to those
innermost thoughts that you are having
every day so these unresolved thoughts
are pretty much like those apps running
in the background what do they do they
train your memory they slow down your
phone they don&#39;t let your phone work
efficiently right these unresolved
thoughts are like that constantly
running research says that we have about
50 stress responses a day so let&#39;s look
at the biology of it and this is not
something tough eighth ninth standard
bound when you have a stress response
anything that makes you fearful scared
angry upset the body responds the
command center fires up all those
neurotransmitters different parts of the
body react differently your heart your
liver your kidneys the adrenaline glands
they release hormones in the body which
help you face the situation you either
fight flight or freeze and once the
situation passes those hormones which
helped your face that are released from
the body but when you hold on to that
over and over those hormones keep
getting generated they don&#39;t leave the
body and too much of anything is toxic
right that&#39;s where it affects you even
people with weight issues people who are
not able to release their weight no
matter how much exercise dieting
nutritionists everything in place which
is not losing weight
because subconsciously they could be
holding on to a memory that stops them
from releasing weight like I had a
client who who was very sensitive
emotional and she was holding onto the
withas insulation literally thinking
that it would protect her from those
emotional jives so she said becoming
thick-skinned was the solution I told
you the cart
conscious mind is not logical it doesn&#39;t
need to make sense to anybody else but
it for her body and mind that was the
solution so that&#39;s how it worked what is
it that you are holding on to those are
the things that you need to rid yourself
off to be healthy not only here but
overall so I&#39;d like to believe that at
least some of us would want to start
cleaning up today right
clean the mental clutter the garbage
that you&#39;ve been accumulating over
decades I&#39;ll tell you two simple things
to do the first thing is remember that
your mind is a private garden what do
you do in a private garden you let
anybody trample in walk on the lawn
pluck flowers through garbage and litter
uh-huh you tell them get out you have to
make sure your mind is that private
garden especially for all of you there
are so many things happening to us every
day somebody got less mark somebody got
a scolding from their parents somebody
has been told what a bad mother or
father they are somebody has been told
something by their boss or you goofed up
at work all these things make you feel
bad they are the emotional garbage you
have to be aware that you don&#39;t want to
collect it and leave it as an unresolved
memory which will cause you an illness
later so out now the other thing that
you need to do is my favorite part love
yourselves actually you know what we
have some time let&#39;s do it right now can
I request everybody just close your eyes
for a minute this won&#39;t take long
close your eyes thank you think of all
the negative things that have happened
to you in the last one week what were
those negative emotions that you felt
the guilt criticism anger sadness grief
pain betrayal heartbreak sadness think
of all the things that have happened
and now that you&#39;ve thought of it own up
tell yourself I chose to feel all these
things because yes you have the power to
choose
you chose to feel all these things not
somebody else they just did their job
they literally but it was you who
accepted that garbage into your mind so
see I chose them and now that you&#39;ve
chosen it choose to release all the
things throw the garbage out of your
mind in your mind just throw it out and
now that you&#39;ve thrown it out tell
yourself I forgive myself for feeling
all these things for allowing my garden
to be littered I forgive myself and most
importantly I love myself when you say I
love myself
your body is listening your body is
responding to the happier emotions and
releasing those happy hormones rather
than when you think I hate myself how
can I do this I regret it I&#39;m guilty I&#39;m
bad so when you say I love myself your
body feels happier you are more generous
with yourself you are kinder you are
more patient you&#39;re more encouraging and
think that tomorrow I will do better
tomorrow I will not get angry tomorrow I
will give it a better shot tomorrow I&#39;ll
be more patient with my child or with my
boss and when you do that your body is
listening to those thoughts and becoming
healthier so at least by doing these two
things you won&#39;t be accumulating more
garbage every day for the bigger things
that you&#39;ve gone through maybe yes you
can go to a therapist and get that
resolved but at least the little things
don&#39;t collect the garbage every day
because you know what this body this
mind is yours for a lifetime it&#39;s the
only place where you have to live right
clear up every day and make sure that
this mind and body
is your house of happiness always thank
you
[Applause]
