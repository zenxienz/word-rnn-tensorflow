thank you so I&#39;m talking about gratitude
from a little different angle from what
we heard earlier gratitude is
thankfulness gratefulness appreciation
this is an emotion it&#39;s a feeling and
it&#39;s rare that there is a profession
that&#39;s built around a feeling but in
fact there is an entire industry that&#39;s
built around just that I am a fundraiser
at UCLA College the academic heart of
the campus and I&#39;m here to talk to you
about the business of gratitude if you
I&#39;d like to share a little fact with you
last year 2015
across the nation colleges and
universities raised more than forty
billion dollars that&#39;s a lot of money of
philanthropic dollars and rest assured
there is an industry and there&#39;s a
business behind that just to give you a
local perspective here at UCLA we just
closed our fiscal year and we raised 663
million again that&#39;s a lot of money and
a lot of gratitude in the college we
raised 62 62 million so I want to point
out you know why do we need to fundraise
ride we need to fundraise at UCLA so
UCLA is almost a hundred hundred years
old and philanthropy has not always been
a part of what we do it has been more of
a need as time goes on and I&#39;m gonna
give you an example a case that has to
do with our students in particular
undergraduate population in the 1950s
and 60s a student could come to school
by working three to four weeks in the
year and that would cover their tuition
for the entire year so they could work
and pay to go to school today
in 20 this is a statistic from 2015 a
student has to work 42 weeks so it&#39;s a
different playing field and students do
student loans look for financial aid and
of course scholarships and scholarships
are given through philanthropy so UCLA
is an engine of social mobility it is
something we pride ourselves on over 66%
of the undergraduates here receive some
form of financial support and so
building the case for scholarship and
making that connection to an individual
who wants to express their gratitude and
give towards that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a
business aspect of expressing that
gratitude I also wanted to share with
you the idea of stewardship
so people give because it makes them
feel good to turn their feeling into
action and that action is something that
here at UCLA in our fundraising offices
we take care of and this is called
stewardship so stewardship the
stewardship offices if they&#39;re focused
to thank every gift that comes in to
UCLA and to report that not only did we
spend it the way we said we were but
that it has an impact and for the folks
who receive that impact that they are
grateful we share that gratitude with
the donors and then the donors
oftentimes and more often than not they
give again and this is a cycle of giving
it&#39;s a cycle of gratitude you know
gratitude is the backbone of
philanthropy philanthropy could not
exist without gratitude I have a couple
of examples of the way that we thank our
folks because we can&#39;t thank them enough
for what they allow us to do here we do
it publicly we do it in special events
and postcards this past year in my
office we sent out over 6600 postcards
thank-you notes
testimonials all sharing how deeply
grateful we are for their support we
also sent out over 540 reports that dig
a little bit deep deeper into the impact
of the lives of that&#39;s been changed for
students and our faculty this this is
also an another poster that we have in a
couple of places on campus you know I&#39;d
like to share a story with you when I
first started at UCLA a number of years
ago I met a woman who has been involved
for really long
time she&#39;s met a number of chancellors a
number of Dean&#39;s and certainly a number
of development officers and one of the
things that she shared with me on her
first meeting were some problems some
grievances she had she&#39;d given a number
of years ago and didn&#39;t know what was
happening where did her money go it are
we still using it are we still spending
it so I went back to the office looked
her up created a rapport met with her a
few weeks later and showed her these are
all the students who have been impacted
by this gift here&#39;s some what some of
the students are doing today here&#39;s the
faculty that were impacted by her gift
and I really showed her a comprehensive
look at what was going on we maintained
a great relationships and many years
later she ended up giving more fun to
the English department to establish a
chair so again this is a cycle of
philanthropy and it&#39;s our job to show
you how grateful you we are for what you
do I have another story that I want to
share it definitely puts a smile on my
face I try to meet with a woman to
engage her in a department and she just
was not interested in meeting me she was
older you know she&#39;s kind of been there
done that and I said you know I really
want to talk to you about the the money
that you gave and share the story of the
student no I&#39;m fine I&#39;m all set I said
you know what ever report for you I&#39;m
just gonna drop it in the mail
two weeks later she calls me and she was
so thrilled to have read the testimonial
of this student and to have seen the
history of how many people just like
that student who were so grateful what
this woman had established a number of
years ago that the next year when I
called her again and said you know I
have another report I&#39;d like to send you
she said let&#39;s go to lunch and Santa
Monica we went to her favorite Mexican
restaurant we had margaritas she tried
to have give me more margaritas and we
really had a wonderful engagement and it
was such a pleasure for me to share
UCLA&#39;s gratitude towards her of what she
did people are grateful and people are
grateful for a lot of different things
and they turned that gratitude into
action here at UCLA and from the time
that I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve
a lot of people who have very different
reasons I&#39;ve met folks who met their
spouses here on campus and UCLA is kind
of near and dear to their heart I&#39;ve met
a number of folks who received a
scholarship many years ago and that
experience in higher education changed
their lives
a lot of those folks are giving back to
us today I&#39;ve also heard a number of
times that just the quality of the
education that they got here at UCLA has
made them be successful and they&#39;re just
grateful for that I have also met some
folks who are grateful for the work
that&#39;s being done to help cure a disease
that might be someone near and dear to
their heart and they want to be a part
of that cure and also folks who love
investing in the discovery and being
part of that discovery and also UCLA
offers the opportunity for people to
leave a legacy and people are grateful
for that opportunity as well so major
gifts are part of what we do it&#39;s when
somebody gives a large gift that really
makes an impact on a division and
there&#39;s a number of places that this
happens for our students our graduate
students and for our faculty and I have
another story I&#39;d like to share I had
the opportunity to meet a couple who&#39;ve
been giving to students for I think
since the 80s and every year they come
and they meet their cohort in the last
couple of years I enjoyed having lunch
with the students and the donors and
hearing the stories the students were
fantastic and interested and wanting to
hear the path that brought that donor to
UCLA and beyond and he shared wonderful
things about you know he came from a
poor family he was the first generation
to go to higher education he had a big
family in a small apartment he used to
sleep on the kitchen floor
he scrounged up money to take the bus to
campus but he couldn&#39;t have been here
without the scholarship and one of the
stories that the students really loved
hearing is when he talked about his
going to his first fraternity party
because he had never experienced
anything like that before
so part of what we do on the business
side is we bring these people together
and these students that are hearing his
story they will be in his shoes someday
and they&#39;re gonna remember that they
were there because of him and it&#39;s
possible that they&#39;ll be grateful and
they&#39;ll give back as well
so in closing I think that I would like
to say that it is a pleasure to work
with people who like to give they they
give it makes them happy they make an
impact here on campus and then lives are
changed thank you
[Applause]
