I would like to say just thank you for
being here thank you for those of you
are gonna watch this on the TEDx
channels we&#39;re so glad that you&#39;re here
as we discuss and talk about I will need
this because I have just the the
old-fashioned deal I always get asked
this question though after I speak
anywhere and so I&#39;ve got to kind of
address the elephant in the room and
that is you don&#39;t look old enough to
speak anywhere are you
does your mom and your dad know that
you&#39;re out here and just so everyone
knows I&#39;m older than 12 I&#39;m 48 and so
hey as I want to dive into creating
change why should you listen to me today
why should you be here why should we
even be interested in creating change
and it&#39;s for two reasons and the two
reasons we should be interested you
should be interested in creating change
is because we will all need the change
that is created by somebody else and we
will all need to create change in our
own lives
I called them Papa jack I was adopted
but he was my grandfather and he took me
in as his own and he got cancer I mean
he eventually passed away but before he
passed away he wanted to come home and
when he came home the family all got
together and we we love to Papa Jack my
grandfather but there were some things
that we couldn&#39;t handle there&#39;s some
things that we couldn&#39;t do there&#39;s some
changes that we couldn&#39;t create because
we just didn&#39;t have the resources and
there was a great organization called
Hospice I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever
heard of them for ever dealt with them
but they came in and did some things
that we couldn&#39;t do this Hospice the
local hospice they created change in our
lives that we could not we needed them
and we are forever grateful for an
organization like Hospice the reason
that we need to be here today the reason
that we need to hear about creating
change is because at some point you and
I will need to change that someone
created so that we can experience life
and life to the full the second reason
is is at some point in life you and I
are going to need to create change in
our own lives I&#39;ll never forget
I remember it just like it was yesterday
my daughter was in first grade
well my daughter was younger she would
come home we&#39;d have this routine and
before she would go to bed every night
she would turn the light off and I&#39;d
come in and leave the door cracked and
the cat would jump up and and say
goodnight and I would sit there and I
would talk with her about her day I
wanted to make sure I connected with her
every day and I&#39;ll never forget this one
night in first grade when I sat on the
edge of my daughter&#39;s bed and I began to
ask her about her day she said it was
okay but I could tell by the tone in her
voice that something was drastically
wrong and I said hey what&#39;s going on you
can talk to dad dad mom and dad are here
for you and slowly her voice began to
crackle and tears began to flow and my
little first grader began to tell me
about how she didn&#39;t have any friends at
school because my daughter is on the
spectrum of autism and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve
discovered and here&#39;s why you watching
in you in this room today need to
understand how do we create change
because at some point we&#39;ll need change
in our own lives that we can&#39;t provide
and at some point we&#39;re going to want to
create change whether it&#39;s in our
marriage and our physical bodies with
our family with our children or in our
job or with our co-workers creating
change matters if we&#39;re going to
experience the life that we all want
now the word creating change is a pretty
cool word right when we say that where
we all kind of smile we all kind of get
emotionally amped and we get pumped up
we&#39;re like yes we&#39;re cheering creating
change and you want to know why because
when we think about creating change we
have this mental image in our mind we
see a picture of a better world that we
live in in a better world that other
people get to live in and it makes us
feel good but to feel good of the phrase
of creating change there&#39;s a hidden
problem this feel good covers it matter
of fact we discovered this problem in
the actual word of creating change mean
think about create Krait means to make
something that doesn&#39;t exist or bring
into existence I mean think about that
that means it isn&#39;t there and you&#39;ve got
to bring it in or you&#39;ve got to create
it this isn&#39;t like mowing the lawn or
doing the dishes or making
abed this is solving or creating or
doing something and that requires some
some thought and some time and some
energy you&#39;ve got to create and then
think about the word change change make
different alter direction have you met
human beings I mean I&#39;ve worked with
middle school high school kids and now I
work with adults for a living it&#39;s like
herding cats I mean anytime you want to
alter or change direction it doesn&#39;t
happen easily so think about this when
we come up with the definition of what
is it to create change think about it
this is where Vanna White would be very
helpful creating change to produce what
doesn&#39;t exist that causes movement in a
different direction how do we create
something that doesn&#39;t exist
that causes people to move in a
direction that they&#39;re not already
moving in it&#39;s a fluffy word that sounds
really good that we&#39;re all gonna cheer
today but the hidden problem it&#39;s very
very difficult and the reason it&#39;s
hidden is because when we think about
creating change we think about the great
people who brought social justice we
think about the great businesses that
brought about innovation we think about
the humanitarian organizations that
create great change that we all applaud
I mean we think about dr. Martin Luther
King and we go isn&#39;t that awesome we
think about mother Teresa and her love
for the poor we think about Bono and his
rent campaign when we think about
creating change then when it comes to
businesses we think of innovative
companies like Apple how many of you
have an iPhone it changed the world
Southwest Airlines when all the other
airlines couldn&#39;t make it they made it
they created change in the industry do
you think of Amazon who would ever think
of buying groceries online not to
mention the humanitarian organizations
like make-a-wish that help kids
experience something that they would
never get to experience
Doctors Without Borders the Wounded
Warrior Project which is relevant to our
local community that serves the military
community compassionate
we think about these great organizations
that create change and it hides the
problem that it&#39;s very difficult
the reality is dr. Martin Luther King
and Bono and mother Teresa and the
businesses and the organizations we
talked about they are the exception they
are not the role it is not normal I did
some research on nonprofits in creating
change did you know that ninety percent
of all of the reported revenue for
nonprofit goes to two point four percent
of the nonprofit&#39;s that exists in the
United States
think about that 90 percent of the
revenue goes to less than two and a half
percent of the nonprofit&#39;s that is a
tragic fail rate we know in the u.s.
that there&#39;s roughly an eighty percent
business fail rate and the nonprofit
fail rate is even higher so today how do
we create change how do we not end up in
the pile of tragic failures how can we
become the exception and here&#39;s what I
stumbled across I stumbled across this
in my reading in my research I
discovered that those great leaders
those great businesses those great
organizations all had four things in
common and if you and I need to
experience a create change in our own
lives or to have someone do it this is
something that all of us need to know
and these four things apply to any
organization you can specify it but all
four of these things are needed if you
or I or anyone is going to create the
change in the world that we want well
the first is a picture a clear picture I
mean to create change they call it
vision it is a preferred picture of the
future I don&#39;t know about you but my
yard it needs to be mowed I have a
picture of what it looks like to be
mowed and then so I will be able to go
out and I will be able to mow it to make
it look like the picture in my mind but
I can&#39;t tell you the number of people as
I&#39;ve worked with people for 23 years who
have sought across the table from me
coffee or to lunch or to dinner and told
me about the change that they wanted to
see created and I see will tell me about
the picture that you see in your mind to
create that change and it&#39;s like a
Fogg I&#39;m like that was a hundred great
ideas can you settle on one I mean think
about it you need to have a crystal
clear picture a preferred picture of the
future I mean think about it
if you ask dr. Martin Luther King he
could tell you in a sentence what his
picture was I desire that people would
not be judged by the color of the skin
but the content of their see it was
simple he knew exactly what his picture
was I mean you think about Steve Jobs we
want to create products Apple will
create products people don&#39;t even know
they want yet you think about Andy
Stanley one of the leaders of the
largest church he says we want to create
a church that unchurched people love to
come to got any sci-fi fans Ridley Scott
from the aliens he was pitching his show
in the nineteen late 1970s about this
aliens and they&#39;re like what is this and
he says it&#39;s jaws in outer space he had
a clear picture of the change that they
want to see I&#39;ve heard it said this way
if you are riding on an elevator with
someone and you&#39;ve got 60 seconds this
change that you want to see either in
your life or in the world or in your
local community can you paint that
picture on an elevator ride because if
it&#39;s not clear to you on an elevator
ride it&#39;ll never be clear to anyone that
you want to help create that change with
so if you want to create change in your
life or in the world in the local
community we must have a clear picture
of exactly what that looks like which
linked me to number two that I&#39;ve
discovered that all great leaders all
great businesses all great organizations
have they have a principle play and
listen I didn&#39;t come up with this I
didn&#39;t make this I&#39;m sure I read it
somewhere but listen to this a dream
without a plan is simply a wish nod your
head come on go ahead one out there not
ahead turn your neighbor and say a dream
without a plan is just the West right
you may have a dream to do something but
if you don&#39;t have a plan then it is just
a wish and when we say principle plan a
plan is not an idea a plan is actionable
steps that you can take their behaviors
and things that you can do I mean think
about when Steve Jobs took over Apple he
went there and they had over 350
products and he was listening to him all
the meeting talk about the different
products and he was going crazy
he said stop it and he went up to a
whiteboard and he drew a quadrant he
said a laptop on the left and desktop on
the left and then he couldn&#39;t happen he
said we&#39;re going to do laptops and
desktops and they were to do them for
consumers who want to do them for pros
got it and they went from 350 products
down to 10 he had a plan he settled his
suit with Microsoft he had a plan to
execute the picture that he saw of Apple
becoming back on the top of the industry
do you want to see change in your life
do you want to see change in your
community&#39;s life do you have more than a
dream do you have a plan that has
actionable steps and the reason that I
use the term principle plan is because
culture and technology are always
changing anybody here been to the local
chick-fil-a I love chick-fil-a if you
ever want to buy me a shake you can do
that I love chick-fil-a but you know
what I&#39;ve discovered in my research and
my discovery chick-fil-a is not in the
fast food industry chick-fil-a is not
even in the chicken industry chick-fil-a
is in the customer service industry
their mission statement is to give value
through service and so you know what
when the industry came out with this
modern thing you could drive through and
you could talk to an electronic thing
and someone could hear on the other side
they could prepare your food and give it
to a drive-through window they move with
the times but when that got backed up if
you&#39;ve been through a chick-fil-a lately
especially here in our community they
have living people standing outside with
a headset taking your order to help it
go faster it is a principal plan because
a dream without a plan is simply a wish
and a wish never created the change that
you need I need or the world needs which
leads me to the third thing that all
great leaders great businesses and great
organizations have and that is passing
Howard Thurman said this don&#39;t ask what
the world needs ask what makes you come
alive because the world needs alive
people
think about this in all my research and
all my reading and all my life
experiences years under the Suns
discovered passion will not only set you
up to succeed it sets you apart think
about it when you have passion about
something they don&#39;t have to pay you for
it you would do it on your free time you
find yourself doing this regardless of
what&#39;s going on the world around you you
are passionate about this thing when you
are passionate you will do the comment
in the uncommon way you will do it
excellently our first speaker talked
about bringing pride back to America
that&#39;s passion people when you are
passionate you will do the little things
well that matter and that stand out and
when you do the little things well and
you make them stand out you will be set
apart you will be set up for success not
only does passion set you apart because
of excellence you do the common things
in an uncommon manner passion doesn&#39;t
have to be taught passion is always
caught think about it as you scale in
creating change in the community or in
your workplace or in your community or
in your home or in your family or your
church or in your soccer field or in
your school whatever it is that you want
to create change you typically can&#39;t do
it by yourself and when you have passion
passion is caught and it is transferable
to other people who will scale with you
and then they will be passionate about
what you&#39;re passionate about because
you&#39;re passionate and you&#39;re on fire and
they don&#39;t begin to do the uncommon I
mean the common things in uncommons way
you&#39;ll be set apart and you will be
successful sometimes I think we asked
the wrong question what does the world
need don&#39;t ask that what ask what makes
you come alive I can answer that easily
I love people
does that come across yet passionate
about people I want to see people win at
life I care about them are you
passionate if you don&#39;t have a clear
picture if you don&#39;t have a principle
plan and you&#39;re not passionate you&#39;re
not gonna make it
you&#39;re not gonna create change in your
life you&#39;re not gonna create change in
the community&#39;s life lastly you need
perseverance now everyone everyone smile
everyone smile cause I&#39;m gonna say some
words but it&#39;s okay you can smile okay
because I&#39;m about to tell you something
hard that&#39;s gonna make you not smile
listen if the problem that you want to
solve could be solved overnight and it
already
solved this is why you need perseverance
if it could have already been solved it
would have been solved somebody would
have done it because it was easy when
you want to create change
you will need perseverance I mean think
of Edison in the lightbulb when he was
asked about his thousand failures he
said oh I&#39;m sorry sir I did not fail a
thousand times I took a thousand steps
to figure out how to make the light bulb
correctly he needed perseverance you
think of Martin Luther King jr. as he
fought for civil rights for human beings
to act like human beings and to give
dignity to other people he was in jail
and persecuted and eventually lost his
life persevered to solve a problem that
would not be solved overnight it would
be great if a mayor could be a place
where would give everyone dignity
wouldn&#39;t it we think about Albert
Einstein Albert Einstein didn&#39;t even
make it into the school he wanted to get
into one of his teachers said you&#39;re
slow think about Walt Disney who created
Disneyland and created what we love and
we may have been frozen let it go right
Walt Disney was fired by his newspaper
they worked for because they said he
lacked imagination Steve Jobs was fired
from the company that he built and yet
he persevered and he came back you see
we&#39;ll need perseverance because
sometimes there will be obstacles
outside of control and I love what dr.
Henry cloud said he said we never focus
on the circumstances we can&#39;t control we
always will focus on the circumstances
we can control if you want to see and
create change you&#39;re gonna run into
problems it is a problem that is not
solved the night and you will need
perseverance so focus on what you can
control what behaviors or actions can
you take that will lead to the results
you want because if you don&#39;t want to
run into problems you&#39;ll never create
change because that&#39;s all creating
changes is solving a problem that
someone hasn&#39;t yet solved this is why
creating change locally is important to
all of us
whether you&#39;re watching this on TEDx or
whether you&#39;re here today whether you
desire to be an inventor or an
entrepreneur or someone who creates a
better place for the world or you just
want to create change in the sphere that
you go in but I want to leave you with a
tough question today are you going to be
here today and be all raw rod and
experience the feel-good of the word
create change are you going to use the
four p&#39;s so that you can actually create
the change that your life needs our
community needs and our world needs
thank you for being a great audience
