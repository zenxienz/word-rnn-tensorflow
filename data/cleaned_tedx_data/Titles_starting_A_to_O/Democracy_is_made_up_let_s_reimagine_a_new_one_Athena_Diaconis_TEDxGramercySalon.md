I&#39;m going to start by laying it all out
you ready
democracy is made up I&#39;ll say that again
democracy is made up democracies
monarchies communist states all forms of
government are all just conceptions of
the human imagination our system of
government was designed like the Rubik&#39;s
Cube or the telephone or any other
product service or system we know today
governments are just experiments in
figuring out how to use rules and
principles to organize people so that we
can benefit from being part of a
collective and so that we don&#39;t devolve
into warring sections at least all of
the time but at some point all of these
forms of government in fact all of our
social systems they didn&#39;t exist until
someone thought them up they didn&#39;t
exist until someone imagined them our
system of democracy our philosophy of
democracy didn&#39;t exist until the ancient
Greeks until this gentleman Clea Sinise
thought it up so if this whole thing
democracy is made up we&#39;re all on the
same page about that well then let&#39;s see
exactly what we created so democracy
this made up philosophy of government
rests on three key principles liberty
justice and equality in the u.s. to help
us live out these principles our
founding fathers created a system of
rules and institutions to help us live
out this practice it was to help us make
decisions distribute power and protect
us against tyranny we know these things
today as how bill becomes a law our
process of elections and how our
president becomes into power but here&#39;s
the thing
those founders they created this system
from their point of view and as you can
see that was a very white very male very
Christian and very wealthy point of view
they didn&#39;t know or in reality they
probably didn&#39;t care that the system of
governance this practice of democracy
that they were designing was heavily
biased by their conception of power an
ingrained belief and patriarchal angle
European and Christian values
they were crafting a system of democracy
yes that was built on those fundamental
principles of liberty justice and
equality but they were also designing a
system that perpetuated this ideology of
power the system they designed was and
still is today biased let me show you
what I mean in 1789 George Washington
was elected in that election only six
percent of the population could vote six
percent there is about a hundred of us
here look around if this was 1789 six of
you could vote and by the way you&#39;d have
to be white you&#39;d have to be male and
you would have to own land
how many of you live in New York City
okay almost all of you well you know as
well as I that it is so hard to own
property in New York City so I don&#39;t
know if any of us would have qualified
to actually vote so over the next 250
years as those empower expanded their
definition of human to include women to
include persons of color to include
queer persons they slowly eked out right
to these roots and that began with the
right to citizenship the right to vote
the right to access education the right
to not be discriminated against for your
race or religion but you can think of
these founders like quilt makers they
were crafting this epic quilt right this
quilt of modern democracy but they were
the crafters they manifested its design
to suit them and anyone else that looked
or was like them anyone else outside of
that system wasn&#39;t included or
incorporated in its design and they
certainly weren&#39;t given any authority to
help craft it so over time as these
rights expanded we were creating more
access than opportunity and you could
look at this list and say okay all right
so sure they made this design in their
image but look at how much we&#39;ve done
we&#39;re expanding access we&#39;re creating
change and you&#39;re right this is a pretty
long list we have made change but I look
at this system of piece by piece tacking
on rights as just more evidence of our
systems flaw because if this process of
progress this piece-by-piece process of
expanding rights was working then why
are so many individual
still fighting for equality
we had an abolitionist movement and then
a whole civil war and then a civil
rights movement in the 1960s but yet we
still need a modern civil rights
movement in black lives matter because
persons of color in this country don&#39;t
have the rights or opportunities that
they deserve as humans in our society we
have had two women&#39;s liberation
movements too and yet we still needed a
women&#39;s March just this past year where
millions of people men and women marched
in 653 cities across the country because
sexism still oppresses all of us and we
still and women still don&#39;t have the
rights or opportunities that they
deserve as people in this country when
those in power still control what gets
added to our quilt we will never create
a more just and equal society when those
in power still control what its design
is rather than inviting all of us to
create a more colorful quilt we won&#39;t
achieve progress we&#39;ll continue this
progress this process of progress that
looks like progress but in fact fails
millions of people over and over again
we need to create a new way in which
we&#39;re redefining power in which we&#39;re
creating progress in which we&#39;re moving
forward to address a fundamental flaw in
our system what I want to see and what I
know is possible is a reimagining of our
ideology of power I want to see an
ideology that&#39;s rooted in the
fundamentals of our humanity not our
race not our religion not our sexuality
not our gender not anything
else that others us to be fair it&#39;s not
that those markers don&#39;t exist it&#39;s just
that in my opinion in the practice of a
modern democracy those markers shouldn&#39;t
generate different levels of value for
people this is the point at which I&#39;m
sure several of you are thinking that
sounds great super idealistic never
gonna happen
change is hard and you&#39;re right change
is really hard we&#39;re humans we don&#39;t
like change and changing something is
fundamental as this bias that&#39;s been in
our system for centuries is even harder
but I know that change is possible
because we have done all this I know
that change is possible because I
wouldn&#39;t be standing on this stage if it
wasn&#39;t so if our goal is a reimagining
of our ideology of power how do we start
well we actually start in the same way
the ancient Greeks did we start by
experimenting we start by imagining we
practice by designing experiences where
we get to see and feel and understand
our humanity in a new way
we prototype by designing new systems
together with those most underserved and
underrepresented and our existing
systems today
an example I&#39;m really proud of is a
experience I designed late last year
with my creative partner Alex Todaro at
median we designed an interactive dining
experience where we enabled participants
to understand the decisions and emotions
that immigrants average citizens and
political representatives experience
when they interact the outcome was
really powerful participants who
typically held positions of privilege in
our existing system shared that for the
first time they understood what it felt
like to be outside of it
another example that&#39;s happening on the
global political stage is a group called
democracy earth democracy earth started
out as a political party in Argentina
that was trying to use blockchain
technology to enable more participants
to pop to participate in policy
decisions today they are a Y Combinator
back to nonprofit that is seeking to
build a platform to support this thing
that they call liquid democracy it&#39;s a
combination of direct democracy and
representative democracy that they
really hope spreads throughout the world
they are creating a new system that
disrupts our traditional notions of
power so that the most underrepresented
and underserved individual can have a
meaningful voice in the practice of
democracy now you might be sitting here
thinking amazing I&#39;m not a part of any
of these things I don&#39;t know how to
design a dinner I&#39;m sure you all do them
how can I contribute to making change
well there&#39;s actually a lot that you as
individuals can do you can start by
doing two things first start doing the
personal work to become a modern
democratic citizen get comfortable with
ambiguity and realize that multiple
perspectives can be valid not just your
own in this new world in this new world
of power and collective experience you
might you might experience some things
that are maybe uncomfortable or
unfamiliar I encourage you to lean into
that discomfort acknowledge and
recognize when your biases crop up and
learn from them too
connect with someone who is different
from you start by talking to someone in
your own community start by actively
listening to them and understanding and
hearing their story try to learn
something new about them that you&#39;ve
never before heard and seek to
understand what the world looks like
through their eyes
the larger point is this if this whole
thing is made up we&#39;ve so much more
capacity to create change than we think
if this whole thing is made up our
system of government our ideology of
power then let&#39;s make something new
together thank you
you
