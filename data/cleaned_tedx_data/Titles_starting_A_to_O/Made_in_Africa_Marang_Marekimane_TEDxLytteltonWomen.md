Africa with a population size of 1.2
billion people it is the second most
populous continent on earth
we have an abundance of resources and
minerals to our disposal we have vast
lands we have a great climate for
cultivating food livestock there&#39;s also
opportunities to discover new medicines
yet with all these resources we&#39;re still
the poorest continent and most
underdeveloped continent we&#39;re given
we&#39;ve given away more than we can afford
to far more than we can afford to and
have had to deal with corrupt
governments we&#39;ve had to deal with human
rights violations we&#39;ve had to deal with
a high level of illiteracy malnutrition
water in San si the water and sanitation
is not adequate across a large part of
the continent and with all this
there&#39;s obviously very high levels of
unemployment that we have to deal with
these are the problems that we have to
face and these are the challenges that
we have in our continent and like for
the better part of the world we look to
entrepreneurs to expose at least 90% of
the jobs that we need in the world now
that&#39;s a heavy request so then I find
myself wondering what is it that I as a
citizen of Africa can do to make a
difference look at me
I&#39;m sure you just see a woman African
you probably notice my dress
and if you look closer you probably even
notice my earrings and well there&#39;s no
chance you can mistake my afro what you
don&#39;t see however is that my skincare is
supplied to me by an African woman my
haircare also from an African woman you
won&#39;t see that the stitches on my dress
were done by hand by an African woman
what&#39;s interesting for me to have found
out is that with women 90 percent of
what they earn is shared with others now
sixty percent of what a man makes goes
into his pocket needless to say this
means that by making sure that women
businesses are profitable
we&#39;re affect a nation at a time this is
why I buy made in Africa as a business
strategy consultant I work with a lot of
entrepreneurs and most of them they come
to me because they are feeling stuck as
to how they can get their product out
onto market what is the best and most
efficient way that they can deliver
their products it&#39;s a conundrum that
we&#39;re constantly trying to solve I&#39;m not
saying I have the solutions but I&#39;m
saying that I have a mind that can&#39;t
think out of the box for that most
people start a business to solve a
problem of their own like the women that
I support they started this business to
start to supply an income for themselves
but then very quickly they realized that
they only stay in business by solving
the other the problems of other people
so they start employing other people the
woman that surprised my skin and hair
care products she is looking for
distributors on
foot on the ground so that they can earn
from the products that they saw the
woman that made my dress has got a team
of seamstresses that work with her to
make sure that they can earn but also
deliver items made in Africa so when I
was a youngster
we used to take a lot of trips with my
parents and we&#39;d go around the country
and along those trips my parents were
teachers about the country itself and
then they would also tell us stories
about their childhood and I&#39;m convinced
it was to make sure that they know that
my life could be worse
just as a gentle reminder and there&#39;s
some lessons from those road trips that
I would like to share with you do or
take only what is necessary for this we
were only allowed to pack one bag each
person one bag if you try to sneak it in
my dad was very quick to tell you that
it&#39;s not going anywhere the second
lesson do not let the unnecessary occur
third lesson educate and entertain
yourself I&#39;m going to break this down
into more granular levels for you so in
developing strategies for people we
often have to look at the way is your
business right now
what is working what is not working and
just from reflecting on the lessons
learned we can fit we can work out what
it is that you need to stop doing
because it&#39;s a waste of time money and
resources perhaps what you need to start
doing to then gain better access to
markets and grow the business that
you&#39;re growing but also what you need to
continue because that is what works and
that is what your customers have
responded to now if you look at age-old
traditions that exist in Africa which we
are very rich with things like herding
cattle those used to be very tedious
stas but in Kenya youngsters have
realized that they could develop an app
to manage your cattle but one step
further you can even hurt your cattle
from the app via GPS tracking in South
Africa we panic about land and we we are
of the notion that you need land in
order to have cattle but again someone
has spotted an opportunity and developed
an app where you can own livestock
without owning the land
so you invest in the livestock a new
type of JSE market if you say so again
let&#39;s take the lessons that we need to
learn from our history and use that to
continue on what is working do not let
the unnecessary occur now this was a
very interesting lesson but this we
weren&#39;t allowed to hang out any body
parts out of the car unless you wanted
oncoming traffic to take it off of you
now in applying this logic to my current
light a day life I look at what it is
that entrepreneurs are doing in their
world and how much the noise distracts
them and it has them going in different
parts of the world and we sometimes
think it&#39;s easier to go fetch what is
outside and bring it in I mean look at
the cell phones the cell phone that is
in your hands right now the one that has
you twitching because you haven&#39;t
checked it in the last two minutes that
very made-in-america permit designed in
america but made in China product it has
changed the way that we relate to one
another we are so dependent on the apps
that are on this fall that we may have
forgotten what life was like now I&#39;m old
enough to remember what it was like to
have a landline landlines you had to
call people and find out where they
and then move towards these people
without knowing what has happened in the
interim so we were restricted by
location because of its design so when
cell phones came in it obviously was
very exciting that we could reach one
another without having to be in one
place breaking boundaries so it is
possible that we create solutions that
completely changed the way that we live
the last lesson was either to ever you
either educate yourself or you entertain
yourself now we weren&#39;t allowed to bring
in any carry-on luggage remember my
first rule we weren&#39;t allowed to bring
in any carry-on luggage so either had
the option of books or some other music
to entertain it and this is where DJ
daddy came into play you had one of two
choices you are either listening to Paul
Simon&#39;s Graceland album or Paul Simon&#39;s
Graceland other and to me these journeys
of Education oranges and also through my
experience with these entrepreneurs has
been that some of them have found the
strangest of products and have made it
work to a point where I&#39;m like where do
you come from and they have to remind me
that I am African this is the
dissolutions come because of the life
that I&#39;ve lived so I need not look
elsewhere to get the solutions the
solutions are actually right in front of
me now a few years ago I traveled to
China and I stayed there for a while I
started feeling a bit ill so I lived in
an apartment and there was a pharmacist
downstairs and I went to the pharmacist
and I told him I feel not so well I&#39;ve
got a bit of a cough and he said to me
well you&#39;ve got two options one I can
offer you Western medicine
but no good I can offer you Chinese
medicine to solve a Chinese problem
I took the Chinese medicine seeing as I
was in China and to take that back into
my current day situation I would like
you to think about what it is that you
are buying into as you go out and seek
solutions for the problems that we
experience and our daily lives what
option are you going to take now there&#39;s
a proposal out there that we should just
all be citizens of Africa and generally
when you travel you need a passport
imagine if we had an I am African card
instead of this passport now Rwanda
started experimenting with this whether
they make it easy for me to spot an
opportunity in Rwanda go there and start
working quite powerful because then
there&#39;s no laborious paperwork in it
they say it&#39;s necessary but come on
visas Texas sure we could find a plane
around that Nigeria has also got an
interesting policy if you want to
manufacture in Nigeria they will not let
you do it if you&#39;re going to be
importing products if they can rather be
made locally now I look at it with envy
South Africa is very diverse very
multicultural and yet I think we have
probably the biggest barriers to entry
that ever exists on the continent we
should be taking advantage of that and
it&#39;s with this in mind that I offer you
two options with many possibilities you
can either use Western medicine no good
or you can buy made in Africa and in
particular made by African women because
you know that 90 percent of it is going
to go towards growing the continent I
thank you
