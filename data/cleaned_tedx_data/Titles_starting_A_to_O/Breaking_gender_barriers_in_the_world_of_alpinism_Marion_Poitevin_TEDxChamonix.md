I&#39;m a mountain guide and mountain rescue
to become what I am today
I had to exploit every bit of my
potential today I want to share with you
how to exploit your potential I grew up
in a little town in the mountains
my parents were big outdoor people we
went climbing hiking biking camping but
also sailing windsurfing or even hang
gliding paragliding caving skiing well
any sport you can do in the outdoors
at 14 I was hooked with Alpine climbing
and world climbing
Here I am training on the Boston glacier
in Xiamen evilly I wanted to spend as
much time as possible in the mountains I
just realized I was following three
rules on a very unconscious way to do so
the first one is to accept challenges am
I good enough should I go for it at that
point just accept the challenge you will
learn something on the process my major
challenge was to join the French army
Montana nearing group it&#39;s a it&#39;s the
elite group of the French army composed
of ten climbers soldiers that go on
expeditions to remote locations all
around the world I was 23 I had about
the group leader was looking to hire
woman because there were more and more
strong female alpinist he wanted to give
a chance to one of them I was very
intimidated to apply I was intimidated
to join French army and become a soldier
to go on expeditions harsh conditions
only with men for months and also to be
the first woman in that team I mean I
would have to prove myself a good friend
of mine she said well you want to spend
time in the mountains they are looking
for a woman I
you should apply where that make sense
so I tried I applied and behind me so
the group was created 40 years ago there
have been 86 team members and I was the
first and only woman to hold that
position I went to at Attica we climb
the highest peak them on Vincent I had
to cover myself from the cold as you can
see in this picture we went to the
Himalayas we climbed a 7,000 meters big
I also went to Canada we climbed high
speed the Mount Logan we hiked this
narrow reach for four or five days and
this mountain is just so far away from
everything you have to take a plane and
land on the glaciers or the world it
would take weeks to get there
we also participated to a mixed French
Chinese expedition I also went to
Pakistan Iran Norway Baffin Island in
Canada again well I accepted that
challenge and it brought me far beyond
my expectation I wanted to spend time in
the mountains and I was a professional a
penis whether the challenge were
accepted with my friend Vanessa was to
climb the zodiac route in Yosemite
National Park on El Capitan in the US
Vanessa had a mountain accident she
broke her back she&#39;s paraplegic but she
kept climbing we heard about a woman a
paraplegic climber who did that route so
it will why don&#39;t we try we accepted
that challenge we team that with other
climbers lives on Souls and Fabian DG we
train hard in Germany to figure out how
to do with the Rope because it&#39;s a bit
different when you pathologic we carried
Vanessa to the foot of the base we
carried on our bags we carry the water
and food for five days we fixed a rope
for her and she pulled herself up like
this for five days during 600 meters we
slept on the world
the furthest we were surprised about
that challenge and we didn&#39;t know we had
this potential they accepted that
challenge in I worked rule number 2
surround yourself with the right people
friend boyfriend/girlfriend family we
need a strong Beca team even if we go
for a solo climb you need a strong team
during these four years in this elite
group I often felt sidelines I felt like
the other team members we&#39;re competing
with me instead of teaming up so I
decided to move on
perhaps because I was the only woman I
apply to become a norm is key and
mountaineering instructor the French
Army&#39;s Kinmont in you in school was
created 90 years ago there are 30
instructors and again yes I was the
first and only woman to hold that
position I was a master caprile after 4
years in the Army and my job was to link
mountain infantry troop I was there to
teach Alpine techniques to soldiers some
of them just came back from true of
duties in conflict zones like
Afghanistan they were strong tough guy
soldiers and I was their teacher but my
colleagues were very supportive they
taught me how to lead search large group
leave entrusting me to lead a group all
the way to the mumblin which is the
highest peak in Europe it stands above
shaman II wanted guys have two clients
when they climbed Aman blow I had 22
clients
so I was there and my troop was
following my tracks so you can imagine
the face of the other mountain guys
cursing my way up was interesting sorry
but after four years as an instructor
the higher ranking officers were not
very happy to have me in the team at the
very beginning they did not want to hire
me because I was only master cap role
and a woman and then they didn&#39;t want to
go higher rank and become a Sergent and
then they didn&#39;t trust me to become a
ski instructor they thought I wasn&#39;t
good enough anyway so I decided to move
on I so short advertisement about the
Montaigne rescue palace that was looking
for a mountain instructor yeah you know
the story yeah so I passed the police
exam I joined the police school for nine
months
and I joined the mountain with two
police yeah you may think I like to get
into troubles no the year was the
montane rescue police was created 60
years ago there are 200 mountain police
Montaigne West real policemen and yes I
was the first and only woman to hold
that position but I can say that today I
found a very supportive team they trust
me to become a good Mountain Rescue
policewoman they trust me to become a
ski instructor and they even want to
hire more female Mountain Rescue
policewoman so there are two we young
women they are in the process to become
mountain rescue a woman just passed the
exam this spring so next fall I&#39;m about
to have a female colleague after 9 years
in these male-dominated institutions
that&#39;s exciting
rule number three train her fail hard
even talented people at some point they
have to Train
if you know if they want to reach
ambitious goal and eventually fail hard
and train harder the first time I took
my mountain guide admission test I fell
I was 22 I was young I was very
intimidated to be a mountain guy because
it&#39;s a lot of responsibilities and only
15 women had passed the exam before so I
tried but I didn&#39;t commit 100% I fed the
clothes so dear after I trained harder
I got new skis I got new boots I went to
the gym during the evenings to train my
climbing and my past and today I&#39;m one
of the 23 female mountain guys in France
out of a total of 1,500 we are not even
true percent I want to say people this
is a very durable job for women I mean
we can do it and this is an amazing job
but you have to train her for the exam
eventually fail and join harder but this
it worth it I love to ski and the better
you ski the muffin you have so I thought
about joining the ski instructor courses
to improve my technique and there is a
special ceramic Sam to join the crosses
so I asked a friend ski instructor if he
thought I could be good enough he said
well you could do it but that&#39;s going to
take you a long time okay I thought then
if I trained bubble then I will shorten
the time so I got new skis I got new
boots yeah I have mini skis and I joined
a kid Ski Club so there was we might
because identity club do not exist so
there I was with my tied ski suit and
these 12 year olds showing me how to
slalom ski and the kids were great and
they cheered me up for my exam so the
first time I felt this special time exam
I started 17 at 29 and I got it year
after so today I&#39;m a ski instructor
training and last winter I went for the
euro test
the giant slalom exam and I said by 0.04
seconds yeah I&#39;m ready to train harder
it&#39;s nothing so what&#39;s next
today I want to share these values with
my woman
I wanna share this with women because
well I&#39;m a woman because we may need
more positive and supportive empaths
because women have different physical
capacities and they have to change
differently to pass exams defined by men
because women have less role models we
can use as a ground to further develop
themselves because women have to break
through more gender barriers and mental
barriers so lead the climb is to develop
women&#39;s leadership with mountaineering
courses they didn&#39;t know it was
impossible so they did it from my train
thank you
