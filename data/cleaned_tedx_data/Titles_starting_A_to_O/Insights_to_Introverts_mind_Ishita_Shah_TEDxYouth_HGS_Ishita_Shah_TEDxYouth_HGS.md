to human foul to space and do alien for
Earth this is how my friends describe me
no they are not trying to insult me
they&#39;re just trying to put me into
familiar slot but couldn&#39;t find any
ladies and gentlemen I am an introvert
and I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it
in fact I&#39;m quiet okay with it really I
know I am different
and I&#39;ve got content to be that way an
alien bore dull these are some of the
objectives that my acquaintances hurl at
me as a father a pathological case but
let it be known once and for all
that interval ism is not an illness
which needs to be treated why then do
you find parents lamenting at the fact
that the child is shy and needs to be
drawn out of his shell let me show let
me share an example with you I live in a
boarding school and have a identical
twin sister Ishita and people in my
school differentiate me and my sister by
simply asking one question what is 2+2
whoever takes less time to answer the
belief is a shitao well if you want to
understand people like me here are some
of the insights into inter words mind
first we introverts are deeply confused
in making small insignificant decisions
but we are better at making big ones
because we think deeply second in two
words are good listeners they respect
people and therefore do not feel the
need to shout back during a discussion
third we enter words are reflective we
tend to go off sometimes think maybe
read up a little before we come up with
the solution of a problem
we love philosophical talks we
understand moral values and years a good
news preparing
in the words are believed to be good in
studies because the thing deeply well
extroverts may seem to have a lot of fun
parting around hanging out with friends
chatting non-stop on phone but
introverts have the same kind of fun in
reading books and listening to music
honestly I could sit alone for hours and
not feel a wee bit alone here are some
of the myths of an introvert first
people believe in the words always want
to be alone that&#39;s not true because they
can get lonely if they don&#39;t have
someone to share their discoveries with
second in the words don&#39;t like to talk
that&#39;s wrong because we talk only when
you have only when we have something to
say third in towards our xenophobes
no we are not afraid of people what we
need is a reason to interact you won&#39;t
catch is saying hi in the train
compartment or talking about a family
friends problems with mother-in-law and
creative mangos and all of this in a
matter of viewers myth number four
people believe in towards a antisocial
that we lack social graces that&#39;s
completely wrong
we are just picky about whom we make
friends with I live in a boarding school
and have many friends but one of my
special friend is devyani and it took us
one month to be friends and to actually
know each other another one have heard
is in two words are rude well we just
don&#39;t like beating around the bush
we are direct to your face as an
introvert people sometimes tell me I&#39;m
rude because instead of being
complimentary I&#39;m blunt I remember when
I used to sit alone in a corner reading
a book people used to pass comments like
you&#39;re so boring you&#39;re a bookworm which
may not exactly be the case
yes a comfort zone is silence but that
doesn&#39;t mean we are dull okay some of
the most creative people in history have
been into words from Albert Einstein
your brahim Lincoln Bill Gates JK
Rowling and Mark Zuckerberg as an
introvert I like to mull over things I
like to see the colonel in the knot I
remember when we went to watch Mona
Michael a supposedly time-pass movie
most of my friends didn&#39;t enjoy it
but then I found something of value
there I learn something which was if you
are passionate enough you can surely
reach your goal yes my friends laughed
at me after that because I found
philosophy in a movie like Mona Michel
but then Mahatma Gandhi once said in a
gentle way you can shake the world
Einstein said the monotony and solitude
of a quiet life stimulates the creative
mind these people have changed the way
we think and have propelled the world
forward in many cases they have proved
you don&#39;t have to be the loudest voice
in the room to be heard sure in the
words are not back slappers or arm
twisters but hey can you imagine a world
without Microsoft or Facebook thank you
