we all remember our first crush mine her
name was sandy she was the most
beautiful girl I had ever seen curly
brown hair green eyes and the dimple on
her right cheek whenever she giggled I
was 9 years old and I wanted to marry
her back then unfortunately for me all
the boys in my class wanted to marry her
- starting with dad the bully who
intimidated other kids took this stuff
and offered them to her as a sign of
sandless love - Zahi this shyest nerd
ever
who made sure to sit next to her during
math classes should she need any help
and her multiplication and long division
exercises I wanted her to notice me
I wanted her attention finally the day
came the day I would make all the other
boys envy me it was at class and we were
assigned to draw something and present
it to our moms on Mother&#39;s Day we each
had our crayons and materials ready for
the job
except for sandy she was upset she
wanted to draw a lily but she only had
the yellow crayon and guess who had the
color purple oh yes yours truly this was
my chance I would give her my crayon she
would definitely fall in love with me
and she would be my wife but not so fast
as it was a bit hesitant on how to
approach sandy Sammy the spoiled brat
had already beat me to it before I knew
it sandy was coloring side by side with
him I hated him I hated how he made her
smile I even hated how both their names
starts with the same letter I had missed
my chance with sandy throughout my 20
years I had lost many Sandy&#39;s the first
time I missed my chance was because I
let out the right moment slip from my
hands all the other times I was just
waiting for another right moment I
waited too long to tell my mom I broke
her vintage vase she found out I got
punished I procrastinated in adopting a
healthier lifestyle
my decisions to go ahead with a diet
were and still are awaiting the right
Monday I was afraid I was afraid to tell
my best friend that he was messing his
life up I was afraid that you would
think I was being judgmental
he wouldn&#39;t appreciate my honesty in any
case he messed up when I lost him anyway
I waited too long to tell my granddad
how much he meant to me
I continued to blame myself for that
after he passed away I hesitated to
choose what university I would study and
I ended up wasting the whole academic
year as a result all of this happened to
me because I kept waiting for this
so-called right moment
I kept questioning myself one is the
right moment to come clean and a mistake
on your part one is the right moment to
speak up even when you know someone you
love would get hurt when is the right
moment to break up with your significant
other and when is the right moment to
tell your parents how much he loved them
before it&#39;s too late
those questions found their way to my
professional life and I found myself
wondering when is the right moment to
ask for a promotion when is the right
moment to quit a job if that incident
with Sandy has taught me anything
instead there is no fixed formula nor a
structural algorithm to define or
produce the right moment there is no
such thing as the right moment it is all
about you it is about how willing you
are to create the right moment and to
reflect afterwards on how right that
moment was all experiences are lessons
learned for the next time you attempt to
create the right moment most of us are
so concerned with finding what&#39;s right
that we end up with all the wrongs we
are held back by our doubts crippled by
our fears of what if I should wait a bit
more what if I ended up making things
worse we think that we will always have
more time on our hands
to those of you who can relate to this I
say we do not have all that time and
time is not on our side it&#39;s okay to be
afraid of what we can&#39;t foresee but
what&#39;s not okay is the statement in your
place when you know you&#39;re missing
something and then wondering why things
are the way they are it&#39;s not okay to
invest your efforts in a dead-end job
and then to wonder why you&#39;re not as
successful or at least as fulfilled as
you want to be it&#39;s certainly another k
to drag a relationship on when you know
you have fallen out of love to waste
your and the other at the others time
and then to wonder what if you were with
that other person your heart beats at
the side and it&#39;s never okay an absolute
no-no to assume that your loved ones
know how much they mean to you to assume
that there will be a tomorrow for you or
for them when you can simply say thank
you and I love you the right moment is
what we make of it fear of the unknown
is enough table
mistakes are unavoidable but what we can
do in the meantime is to provide
ourselves with as many experiences and
as many lessons learned that&#39;s when we
become more aware of how to seize
whatever opportunity lies in front of us
that&#39;s when we shall never have to wait
recently I approached my boss at work
and I told him I believe I deserve a pay
raise he has been expressionless so far
so I&#39;m not quite sure about this right
moment but at least I have not gotten
myself fired however I made sure my
parents know how much I appreciate them
and how much they mean the word to me
and as hesitant as I was about giving
this TEDx talk it was they who cheered
me up
and supported me all the way through it
so the bottom line if you are ever
confronted with a sandy but did not have
the color purple it&#39;s okay you don&#39;t
need it you make use of what you&#39;ve got
which is what really
matters mix the colors red and blue
together and guess what color you get
thank you
