let me take you to a place called Allen
alter an island on the east coast of
Mexico where legal Manny happens where
rare earth minerals are dug up and is
very minerals I process to go into our
phones laptops electronic devices hot
enough is harvested to make our phones
load milliseconds faster there&#39;s a
wikipedia online videos on YouTube and
images we&#39;re now able to connect these
places the touches of our fingertips
these are the people these are the
places and these are what is sold to us
have you ever considered where our
phones are made how much of the world we
hold in our pockets or how we are able
to view these landscapes and the devices
that are causing these places
now at an altar is entirely fictional
from its images the narratives the
videos they&#39;re all designed for a more
modern-day understanding of place a
place on the Internet in the flickering
of screens throughout history we&#39;ve
always created fictional cities from
Atlantis to our Dorado to Sandy Island
one belief about Atlantis was that Plato
being a master storyteller is to tell
the politicians of Greece that the
people Atlantis got so greedy and
corrupt that he sent them to the bottom
of the ocean
Plato using Atlantis as a cautionary
tale at an altar is a phantom island
dispersed across the Internet in
response to conflict technologies the
very technologies we use to watch this
talk we as architects are now able to
create a place without it being
physically manifested how do we navigate
information today how many times have
you blindly trusted Google Maps and gone
to your destination how does it all
really work these were the questions I
really just wanted to understand
so as excited as I was I started
uploading all my photos onto Panoramio
in Google at the start I used to you
know tag all the photos that I used to
go to but then I thought well what if I
started tagging mismatched locations so
I started tagging my London photos in
Mexico that got accepted and then let&#39;s
push it a bit further
I started photoshopping them and then
eventually rendering from complete
scratch there became so real that he
went Google&#39;s algorithms couldn&#39;t tell
them apart and in 2013 when Google map
maybe came up I wrote to Google I said
this island that doesn&#39;t have a name is
called out at Nova
I waited for a week and had a reply
congratulations we have made changes
based on suggestions
happy mapping well then I thought was
logical - make a website create a
Wikipedia article have people add to
that Wikipedia editor and then through
webcam travel I made a stage set model
those live streams onto Google Earth I
referenced the legal minds of the Congo
the Amazon and all the informal housings
that was happening in Mexico this was
all done in the little room in London
live streamed onto Google Earth we set
off multiple fire alarms and this
project got so far that the National
Geographic photographer contacted me and
asked Monde tell me is this place safe
to travel this fiction that I waved
together in 2013 brings together many
things are gonna face in the future
we&#39;re currently living in an information
era where everything we consume is
governed by an explosion of bits and
bytes how do we actually navigate this
space I had a goal to change the
perception of architecture projects that
made a difference rather than just more
buildings and as in the future jobs are
going to be completely different I just
want to share a couple of insights today
virtual ecstasy making the unmake herbal
think about all the projects that
architects have designed in the last 200
years or the amazing spectacular
I just endless spaces but guess what
none of these are actually built we as
architects by nature construct fictions
mere representations of worlds that
could be on average only 0.5% of
architectures actually built we do the
endless amounts of competitions use our
blood you know sweat do endless
all-nighters and for what for that point
five percent well we&#39;re creating a
platform which actually experience all
these things and through technology one
can take pure and easy for example an
architect in the 18th century it&#39;s done
around 1804 to 1806 or to be impossible
practically unfeasible the column
recedes from the foreground into the
background so what did we do we painted
this in virtual reality brush by brush
stroke by stroke
we started decoding Pyrenees illusions
we spent about what 250 hours in reality
yeah and through this people are now
able to experience it we created into a
space where you go through the shadowy
Lions of Pyrenees you&#39;ll get lost in an
endless haze now virtual reality is
nothing new it&#39;s been around since the
1960s
from the center Rama to Nintendo give me
a go in the 1990s Rosen until recently
that graphics got good enough for us to
actually play tricks on the mind now a
lot of people ask me about one what is
virtual reality can you please tell me
what virtual at least I can use it I
always reply by saying remember when you
were a kid and your parents told you not
to put your eyes too close to the screen
well now we&#39;ve literally wrapped it on
our faces
did you don&#39;t excites me at that about
the most about the future the day when
we can&#39;t told the difference between the
two when the physical world and the
virtual world will start blurring into
each other architecture become
expression of ourselves we can pick and
choose objects textures volumes our
current conventional idea of place is
already being consumed by digital
landscapes we decide where to stay on
images and ratings on Airbnb we live
vicariously through other people&#39;s
Instagram feeds
we&#39;re not far off from being able to
actually imagine a room where you can
see your Wi-Fi or radio signals or
alternatively bask in a city of gold in
your room or if you wanted to just a
ruin and get lost in your living room
this is what the future of architects
and designers could do not limited by
physical constraints we&#39;re already
experiencing a revolution in what a
place is and what a place could be just
like a Delta we in the future are the
reality makers one can tell stories
about the opinions about the world and
architecture being the ultimate
experience machine not just on the
flatscreen but through visceral
fantastical electric pixels of tomorrow
thank you
