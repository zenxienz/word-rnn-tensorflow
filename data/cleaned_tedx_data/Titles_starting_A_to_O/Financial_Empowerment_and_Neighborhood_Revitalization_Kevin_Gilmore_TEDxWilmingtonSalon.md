this is my dog mr. P he&#39;s pretty happy
we are on a boat watching the sunset
together out in the middle of the bay I
think he&#39;s pretty happy because his
basic needs are being meant he&#39;s got
plenty of food it&#39;s got a great shelter
lots of time to play and run around lots
of love in his life some would say he&#39;s
living life to its fullest financial
stability allows for us to provide for
the basic needs of ourselves the basic
needs of our families financial
empowerment is about taking control of
our finances and not being controlled by
them financial empowerment is not about
how much money you have or how much
money you don&#39;t have it&#39;s about choices
how do we use our choices to create that
stability in our lives to meet our basic
needs as an affordable housing developer
for the past 25 years I also believe
that simple decent and affordable
housing provides for that stability in
our lives on which we can build and grow
I think back to some basic psychology
that most of us learned in grade school
you recall Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs a
picture with me a large triangle and at
the base of that triangle the base of
that triangle our basic human needs
shelter warmth food and in the middle of
the triangle our psychological needs
feeling a sense of belonging a sense of
appreciation and at the pinnacle of that
triangle
it&#39;s our self-actualization fulfilling
all of our whole purpose and the basic
concept here is that at the you have to
address your needs at the bottom of the
triangle those basic human needs have to
be addressed before you can build on
them and it
Eve above financial stability allows for
us to provide that foundation I dedicate
my life to helping others build strength
stability and self-reliance I&#39;ve done
this for many years through housing
through building homes and repairing
homes so that folks can have that
stability in their lives on which to
build on which to achieve this higher
level of needs in their lives so if you
recall with me about eight years ago we
had this financial recession in our
society and over those years I started a
witness that in our small towns in our
communities the level of vacant and
abandoned homes was starting to increase
an increase as we drove around town you
could see that postings and doors and
windows started to pop up on a lot of
our structures if you walked up to those
doors and those windows you&#39;d see the
posting that said condemned or it said
that this house has been winterized by
the bank or that it was scheduled for
demolition so our position as an
affordable home builder we started to
ask ourselves what role do we have not
just in helping an individual or a
family with a house or repair but role
what role do we have in this society to
help revitalize entire communities how
can we use our position to address that
need and about a year ago we learned
about a financial empowerment program
stand by me we embraced it and adopted
it and said with this resource in
addition to what we do with building and
repairing homes we can now offer
financial empowerment opportunities to
an entire community so we started to to
to offer workshops to anyone in the
community who wanted to take advantage
of this resource
we started to do not workshops not just
with individuals but with entire
families workshops for children for
adults to help them see that they can be
a resource in their own community to
improve their own situation we started
to see this momentum build you could see
a sense of hope
physical repairs physically improving
the visual the infrastructure of a
community through homes seeing their
neighbors become homeowners for the
first time and through the environment
and but empowerment financial
empowerment opportunities that were
there people could sense a sense of hope
was being developed we started working
with community leaders to build trust
within the neighborhood through a series
of activities just as simple as a
neighborhood cleanup and bringing people
together we call them dumpster days and
people would come out fill dumpsters to
physically clean up their neighborhood
we started a series of high impact low
costs volunteer intensive gatherings to
work on addressing a whole blocks at a
time we call to rock the block all these
elements coming together with the
baseline of financial stability that
people could start to look at there the
resources differently that people could
control their financial situation and
not be controlled by it or starting to
have an impact in these communities that
were focused on at this time I believe
that through this experience and what
we&#39;re seeing is that financial
empowerment is an essential tool in the
toolbox of neighborhood revitalization I
ask you to think about how can you use
financial empowerment how do you see
financial empowerment the creation of
that stability in one&#39;s life to
revitalize your community whatever that
means to you and your situation how can
you help create that stability in
someone else&#39;s life
how can you create the doggie effect and
someone else&#39;s life so they have this
stability to become active productive
members of their own community
