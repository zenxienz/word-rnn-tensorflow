signed is all about making life better
it is shaped our culture and history and
now it&#39;s it&#39;s changing our future from
claims and phones to medicines there is
hardly an aspects of our daily lives is
not touched by engineers physicists
chemists and biologists working
tirelessly to improve life for all
science make life better was affirmed
the London International Youth Science
Forum or Li ysf which we were fortunate
enough to attend this summer spending
two weeks in London with over 500
students from 70 countries across the
world it was inspiring to meet young
people our age have already achieved so
much such as 17 year old Daniel Zhang
who&#39;s created a new method for trance
diagnosis or Andrew Tang who was created
in early earthquake warning system one
talk that particularly inspired us all
was by Jonathan Firth the executive vice
president of spaceport and program
development at Virgin Galactic his talk
was on the commercialization of space
travel you may think this is a simple
matter of replicating aircraft travel
taking off landing but this is not the
case a flight from London to Sydney will
take almost a whole day using today&#39;s
standards of aviation Virgin Galactic
envisions the idea of shorting this
travel time to a mere two hours but
instead of taking off and going the
distance Virgin Galactic spaceship 2
will leave Earth&#39;s atmosphere and enter
orbit here
it will let the earth rotate beneath it
and after a certain amount of time
re-enter the atmosphere to glide to its
destination the thing we found most
striking however about our time London
was seeing that an underpinning all
these advancements in science no matter
how different they may be was a common
theme about teamwork and worldwide
cooperation the greatest advancements in
science are not made by a single man
locked in their office working alone for
years on end until they have a Eureka
moment they are made by large
collaborations of scientists across the
world this is because the problems
facing the earth today cannot be
confined within the boundaries of
physics chemistry or biology but so
instead of mixture of many different
disciplines as such it is now impossible
for one person to be able to answer his
questions alone and though ISF was a
great reflection of this we&#39;ve got to
meet hundreds of people from every
corner of the globe and made many
friends we intend to keep
touch with although their beliefs and
ideologies may have been different from
ours it was unanimous that everyone that
I was passionate about using science to
improve the world nowadays this shared
ideal is more vital than ever for the
international community of scientists
you need to work together to overcome
political boundaries intense global
relations for the best ment of the
planet as a whole because that&#39;s is what
will lead to a positive future we are
privileged to be a small part of this
and hopefully a small part of a larger
scientific community thank you
