alright ladies and gentlemen this is a
bike
not just any bike it&#39;s a Dutch bike I&#39;m
Dutch so good expert product no this is
from the company called Vaughn mouth and
they make actually very expensive bikes
because this bike is an electric bike it
has the battery on top and the frame the
engine in the middle and it were helps
you to pedal extra these bikes are also
pretty expensive they start at two and a
half K up these are expensive bikes and
they have GPS tracking and blah blah
blah in there now who of you loves
cycling who loves the bike see Wow yeah
that&#39;s great that you respect bikes who
of you is in the forwarding industry in
the shipping industry a few a few now
there is a little bit of a mismatch
between bike lovers and let&#39;s say your
average shipper and every shipper will
transport bikes because how do we
transport bikes you take a bike you put
the steering wheel like this and you put
it in one bar large cardboard box now
shippers are forwarders take these boxes
and just throw the box that&#39;s it because
they don&#39;t really respect bikes that
many except the few here of course you
are the best combination so if a moth
had a problem a lot of their bikes being
shipped especially also in the Middle
East and in northern america got returns
because as shippers would throw the
boxes in airplanes in cars at driveways
these boxes would get damaged but also
the bikes in there and these are very
expensive bikes so people return the
bikes bla bla bla
in enormous costs so this car yay one of
the cofounders of a moth thought hmm who
else is shipping stuff in large
cardboard boxes but they do arrive
safely and then he thought televisions
so we just stole the idea from
televisions they just printed
it&#39;s our vision on about there&#39;s still a
bike in there it&#39;s an electrified s bike
it&#39;s all there and since then the
shoppers respect because this is wow
that&#39;s a gigantic OLED display whatever
and now comes the great part returns
dropped by 77 0% yeah absolutely
fantastic now as ID DJ I&#39;d like to
collect these kind of examples and help
other companies to implement implement
these and I&#39;m here to outline a little
bit on how ideas work there&#39;s an
illusion about ideas that you sit
somewhere and you have this beautiful
invention that&#39;s not the case IDs are
not so much inventions they are way more
discoveries and combinations so it&#39;s
literally looking outside to find
something and to combine that in an
elegant way now
I&#39;m an idea DJ and together with my
colleague Mark hell even we&#39;ve indeed
written a book and about that not
invented here taking IDs from outside
what does an ID a DJ do an ID DJ is
someone who creates powerful and
beautiful combinations which add value
now the heroes of our time because it
comes here an idea DJ mixes IDs and
concepts it&#39;s like a DJ in music ID gjz
music take pieces of music mix them
together and actually these are the
heroes of our time now the most popular
DJ&#39;s get flown to LA to Ibiza but even
more popular DJ&#39;s have their own
airplanes I don&#39;t know if you know
Afrojack yeah his airplane is called F
Road yet absolutely crazy now these guys
love airplanes and love to fly together
with my beautiful wife Linda I traveled
throughout the Silk Roads for one and a
half years and the sport was not to use
airplanes why did we do that we&#39;ve
traveled all the way
silk road&#39;s all the way into Iran
beautiful Iran crazy Turkmenistan
beautiful India you name it just to
learn how people deal with challenges
which are at the core similar as we do
here but in our cultures and other
environments people figure out other
solutions to them and that&#39;s interesting
so let me let me take you to the
outskirts of Tehran where a lot of
people in Iran move from let&#39;s say
farmlands into the cities and tell
around the capital of Iran so a lot of
people move to the city and there you
see an incredible urbanization going so
Tehran is growing and if you combine
urbanization with transport or mobility
they get this a mobile atm ladies and
gentlemen and mobile ATM this figured
out a lot of it&#39;s also actually a lot of
a lot of problems
normal infrastructure cannot cope they
cannot build bank branches enough and
everything so you have a mobile atm it&#39;s
satellite connected very advanced
separate entrance from a male and female
all fall off and I think also the
easiest way ever to steal a truckload of
money
but anyway now here today to share with
you three id DJ secrets first one your
best ideas come from outside secondly
you need to create cool combinations and
thirdly don&#39;t copy pastes let&#39;s dive in
the first one your best ideas come from
outside how does that work let me give
you an example in chengdu they&#39;ve mixed
a restaurant receipt with a lottery
scratch card it looks like this this is
an actual receipt for us in a restaurant
in Chengdu and the guy we were if
explained yeah you need to ask for to
receive here that&#39;s private persons ok
I&#39;ll ask for the receipt because the tax
office wants more people to ask for
receipts normal people private people
are not that interested in receipts but
Chinese love to gamble and the Chinese
tax office knew that so they implemented
these two little scratch cards if you
scratch them open you can earn part of
your money back so unless people I
started to ask for receipts and
restaurants owners had a problem because
they were being very creative with our
administration but with so many receipts
going around it was a big challenge to
do that so these are little little
things you can you can use to mix ideas
now you need to look outside to remix
how do we do that the key is to see that
ID DJ&#39;s know that you need to look
outside your area outside your sector
you need to step out of your zone and
the key is that you can do that via
cross industry innovation cross silo
innovation cross culture innovation
across whatever innovation the key is to
step outside and take IDs in second
secrets create cool combinations
not just any combination every as we
look at any kind of combination if you
take 7 Lego breaks 2 times for the
number of combinations exceeds 85
billion crazy with just 7 Lego bricks
imagine in your organization in your
surrounding the number of very
is way higher than these seven Lego
bricks so ID DJ&#39;s know that random is
too random just combining two things is
great for artistic installations but not
always that useful so how do we survive
that we use tools let me give you an
example of a tool if you&#39;ve ever flown
via Heathrow Airport you see these
beautiful commercials from HSBC
where it take a specific words and put
different meanings to it
that&#39;s I love these things I make
pictures of that all the time and you
see that here as well for
accomplishments beautiful Association
exercises now that&#39;s the same thing as
we&#39;re gonna do with you right now let&#39;s
for instance take the word customer now
customer let&#39;s look for some synonyms if
you analyze customer you have maybe
someone in retail but with taxi business
it&#39;s more passenger or in education
things it&#39;s a student at the core these
things are connected are virtually
similar but in different areas and
different segments they are treated
differently
so hence the business synonyms method
which allows your brain to jump from
bucket to bucket to figure out what did
they do there to solve a similar issue
so instead of attracting customers you
may want to look at how Harvard and
Stanford attract students they target
that specifically you have Scouts like
in soccer and to try to get the best
students in if companies would do the
same thing for their customers they
would get a way more stable customer
group but many organizations just like
our artists before shoot with hail and
try to hit some kind of customer to
attract them now to our way more subtle
ways to do that yet they are hidden in
different industries or different
sectors and you can do these kind of
crossovers on multiple levels you can do
that on products or services on your
processes or your business models or
your partnerships as soon as you think
who else has solved my problem and most
likely they are not in my direct
surrounding now let&#39;s me let me give you
another cool example literally in this
case let&#39;s combine skiing
with a power plant or actually a waste
burning plant which also generates a bit
of power and then we get to go to
Copenhagen to the a mugger Resource
Centre that&#39;s what it looks like a stack
impression and what they they came up
with is burning waste which also if you
like your fridge if you have a warm side
the back side of your fridge is warm so
the inside is cool
so they&#39;ve combined that into a ski
slope it looks like this you can ski
from the top down while they&#39;re burning
stuff and you can also climb the sides
and the cool fact of this is it&#39;s real
it&#39;s being constructed as we speak so
it&#39;s a fantastic combination they need
the city of Copenhagen still needs to do
something until they go fully circular
but this is a good mean combination and
also linking multiple actors like in
this case tourism or a landmark a cool
combination literally now you need to go
from plus 2x so not just combine these
two things but actually look for the X
Factor and the X Factor is both powerful
and beautiful all right
last secret three secrets don&#39;t
copy/paste copy/paste makes no sense
copy-pasting and when we were traveling
through Vietnam I took this this picture
here this is copy paste kind of Nike
kind of Adi I saw something of Queen by
copying for sure but to generate that
x-factor don&#39;t just copy paste because
sometimes you don&#39;t even look that good
and you get these kind of things makes
no sense so don&#39;t copy paste rather copy
adapt paste copy learn something paste
copy take one element paste because then
you make it specific to your environment
and also it&#39;s not about copying the what
because that&#39;s too easy
it&#39;s about copying the thinking behind
the thinking and that sometimes a little
bit more complex so don&#39;t copy paste
copy adapt paste and that brings our
journey back here to beautiful Antwerp
I&#39;ve been living in now for fourteen
years and let&#39;s say about seven years
ago we moved to zoom embarked and
straight straight across the street we
have our local Aldi and our local all we
had a bit of a bit of an issue with
their shopping carts so a lot of
shopping carts got moved out student
City Antwerp so it&#39;s a very nice copy
adapt paste that shopping carts become
barbecues transportation things very
creative although for all the these
things are pretty expensive now if you
combine that with an ankle monitor who
views ever had an ankle monitor nothing
I had I have one person met him not so
long ago so an ankle monitor goes around
your ankle and if you&#39;re not allowed to
leave the house or something something
starts to beep at the police and they
come and call you and blah blah blah in
this case the only thought we will
implement the same system so here&#39;s my
local all these there he is and if you
take the shopping carts out of the
parking terrain the thing will lock so
it&#39;s virtually impossible to move unless
you start to lift it up and then
students say I don&#39;t butter so great so
this actually took me some some effort
to move the cart here the security guy
came to look at what are you doing I
said no I&#39;m just making a picture and
nicely put the thing back so it&#39;s
another
beautiful combination and you can do
these things on multiple levels so to
conclude my story ladies and gentlemen
how to become an IDE DJ first find your
best ideas outside secondly you need to
create cool combinations go from plus 2x
both powerful and beautiful and lastly
don&#39;t copy paste copy adapt paste and
with this I wish you good luck at
combining me an idea today thank you
[Applause]
