today I&#39;m gonna tell you a story about
the father of genetics Gregor Mendel and
how he persevered and rose above his
challenges to found a whole new field of
biology this is a story about finding
your particle your uniqueness and rising
above the small things to have a really
big impact Gregor Mendel was born
Johan Mendel in 1822 and grew up on his
family&#39;s farm and what was then the
Austrian Empire and is now the Czech
Republic one of Mendel&#39;s favorite tasks
on the farm was to help his father tend
the orchard one of the jobs in the
orchard was to graph new plants to make
new varieties I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve
ever tried to graft plants before but
it&#39;s highly technical work you have to
cut the root of one plant and then you
cut the top of another plant then you
have to stick them together in just the
right way so that you don&#39;t kill the new
plant Mendel learn how to do this at an
early age and appreciated precision
technique and attention to detail
early on Mendel enjoyed science but his
family was not rich he couldn&#39;t afford
it to be a scientist to be able to
continue his studies in Sciences he was
advised to join a monastery he became a
priest but he didn&#39;t really enjoy being
a parish priest so he decided to teach
high school then as now you have to get
a teaching certificate to be qualified
to teach and to get that certificate you
have to take a test Mendel failed his
teaching exam you can imagine that
that&#39;s done no one likes to fail no one
likes to have their life plans to railed
so the monastery paid for him to go to
the University of Vienna to get extra
training in physics chemistry and
biology you can imagine that he really
studied hard and paid a lot of attention
to what he was learning he did not want
to fail again fast forward a few years
to when Mendel was at the Abbey he
decided to look at heredity at that time
the blending hypothesis was the accepted
theory for heredity it stated that
offspring are a blend of traits from
their parents and this made sense to
people if parents have a child that
child doesn&#39;t look exactly like either
of their parents but rather they&#39;re a
blend of traits from both parents you
get your blonde hair from your mom
your athleticism your dad and over time
in future generations the blonde hair
might get lost and so you could lose
traits over time the problem with that
theory was that no one had looked at
this trait by train people looked at an
organism as the whole and looked over
maybe one or two generations and so
blonde hair might pop up again after
five generations but scientists weren&#39;t
looking that far out so that&#39;s where
things stood when Mendel&#39;s decided to
start his experiments he decided to look
over many generations and look at just
one trait at a time he eventually looked
at two traits but the point is he
started simple one thing at a time
so he started planting peace and paid
attention to their properties he looked
at things like pea plant height if you
mated to Paul tall plants what did their
offspring look like what did their
grandchildren look like how tall were
they Mendel asif decided to look at
flower color seed shape seed color
flower placement pea pod shape and color
the point being that he looked at each
of these things one at a time rather
than looking at all seven at once in all
Mendel planet around 30,000 people ants
and so let&#39;s appreciate that number for
a minute 30,000 people ants and it&#39;s not
just that he planted 30,000 people ants
he also kept track of the grandparents
the parents the children and so on the
bookkeeping alone is amazing not only
did he have to keep track of the family
trees for his pea plants but he also
took detail
notes on those seven traits the pea
plant height flower color seed shape
color pod shape and color and flower
placement he had to be extremely
organized to keep all of that straight I
don&#39;t think I&#39;m as organized as Mendel
was or as gifted note-taker
but he learned early on in his childhood
that precision and attention to detail
are important lessons and he carried
those with him
remember that Mendel had received extra
training in physics chemistry and
biology because he had failed his
teaching certification exam in both
physics and chemistry there are
particles that we can&#39;t see and those
particles behave in predictable ways
that are governed by natural laws these
particles are things like electrons
protons and neutrons and even though we
can&#39;t see them we can design experiments
to test their properties and to learn
more about them at the time there
weren&#39;t particles in biology but Mendel
reasoned chemistry is particles physics
has particles why not biology he
reasoned that the thing that&#39;s getting
passed from parent to offspring were
particles now we know that that thing
the stuff that gets passed from parent
to child is DNA but remember this was
the mid-1800s scientists couldn&#39;t even
agree that DNA was the heredity
information or even what its structure
was until the mid 1950s so at any rate
Mendel thought about his traits the pea
height flower color he thought of those
things as particles that get passed from
parent to offspring and this was a
radically new way of looking at heredity
while he thought about them this way and
looked at these traits over multiple
generations he could he saw that he
could start to understand their
properties and make predictions about
their behavior just like the particles
in physics and chemistry there are also
equations that can be written to
describe and predict the behavior of
electrons protons and neutrons so Mendel
realise reason that the
must be equations to describe the
behavior of his particles in biology so
we used math to predict how its
hereditary particles must act he
presented his landmark results in 1865
in 1866 and was largely ignored people
at the time didn&#39;t really understand
what he had done they took one look at
his paper thought it was too mathy I
didn&#39;t really try to understand it
Mendel died in 1884 well before genetics
was ever a branch of biology and he was
very much underappreciated
it wasn&#39;t until 1900 when three other
scientists all working independently in
three different countries verified
Mendel&#39;s results when those scientists
searched through the literature they
realized they weren&#39;t the first one to
make their discoveries about heredity
though rather Mendel had made them 35
years earlier Mendel&#39;s story is one
example of an obscure but highly
innovative person that rose from humble
beginnings and circumstances to be
regarded as the father of genetics
I like Mendel&#39;s story because it
illustrates several important points
first even the greats fail don&#39;t be
afraid to fail you can rise above that
failure second everything is related
being interdisciplinary is important and
third don&#39;t listen to the naysayers your
time will come
Mendel&#39;s did thank you
you
