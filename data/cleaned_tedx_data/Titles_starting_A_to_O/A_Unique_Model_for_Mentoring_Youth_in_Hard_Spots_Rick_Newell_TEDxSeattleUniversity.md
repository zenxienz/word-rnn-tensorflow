check check check
sound good my name is Rick Newell and if
you haven&#39;t noticed yet I am white I&#39;m
about as white as you can be but for the
next few minutes I&#39;m going to talk about
African Americans which means I&#39;m
probably going to unintentionally offend
somebody right in fact I may have
already done it and all I&#39;ve done is
introduce myself right in practicing for
this my white friends told me to include
things that my black friends have said
don&#39;t say that and my black friends have
told me to include things that my white
friends have said don&#39;t say that so I
have already offended all of my friends
because this is hard right it&#39;s I just
want to acknowledge they&#39;re talking
about race is hard this has been a part
of my story from the beginning my
parents named me after my dad&#39;s best
friend in college who is black
Claybourne Richard Jones he was third
the nation and scoring and Division one
basketball and he was also in my parents
wedding which doesn&#39;t mean much nowadays
but back in the 60s
having a black guy on your wedding was
kind of a big deal so knowing I&#39;ve been
named after him is one of the reasons we
started this organization called must
can I tell you some scenes that for the
last 11 years have happened almost every
day at my neighborhood of the Rainier
Valley act one will call childhood a
healthy african-american baby with all
the promise of potential a newborn
brings is born into poverty with only
one pair most African Americans don&#39;t
grow up in poverty but far too many do
and the parent of this one is going to
have to work at least one low-paying job
and/or be on assistance so the
environment he&#39;s gonna grow up and is
often really hard act to high school or
the last stop rarely is anyone gonna get
him up in the morning for school or ask
him about his grades and even though he
has as much potential as you or I he&#39;s
going to become lost in the system and
drop out of high school
act 3 after high school without a
diploma or guidance he has a very little
way of knowing what it takes to earn an
honest living or raise a family and so
that lonely discarded angry kid has a
69% chance of going to prison and then
his kids grow up without a dad 760
african-americans dropped out of high
school in the last class Seattle Public
School District because the system in
America has failed 760 that&#39;s as if two
old high schools didn&#39;t graduate their
senior classes 69% of the male&#39;s will go
to prison we all know those that have
been shot and killed or they often
continue in this cycle of poverty
they&#39;ve been living 760 it feels
hopeless doesn&#39;t it but it&#39;s not I
wanted to share with you some stories
how some very unique individuals are
helping these guys rewrite acts two and
three of their lives into some really
cool stories I want reduced you to
Shahin we call him shy but he is
anything but shy he&#39;s extremely affable
bright a good athlete and as he&#39;s quick
to point out very handsome his act one
occurred right here in Seattle his dad
was never really in the picture his mom
died of a drug overdose so imagine your
childhood with neither your mother nor
your father his act - his grades were
low he ended up stealing a car the
promise and potential he was born with
was beginning to erode away and not to
sound sensational but prison or early
death right around the corner his best
childhood friend was shot and killed
just two years ago and think about life
for many of these kids perspectives
would you have honestly finished high
school if no one got you up in the
morning for school or asked you about
your grades or what if the only square
meals you got were the ones you got at
school or you didn&#39;t have enough clothes
one kid I know well has been to four
different high schools in a little over
a year and not because he&#39;s a bad kid I
know they&#39;re just a few of the issues
that many kids face shai didn&#39;t face all
of those issues he was raised by
great-aunt was a great lady and he still
struggled but if you face some of those
issues you might also find yourself
making shockingly bad decisions so it
begs the question what could alter his
life from what feels like his destined
prison early death to a totally
different life rich with possibility
before we look at a solution we&#39;re
hearing many great ideas today just a
solution I would like to look at the
problem little deeper in my opinion the
greatest need in the urban core by quite
a bit I think second place is way behind
is positive male role models when you
fix this you fix a lot the tragic fact
is more than half of african-american
kids will grow up without the influence
of their father for a 2012 Census Bureau
report but here&#39;s the deal if you get
anything two things out of this talk
this is one of them because so many
african-american males are separated
from the kids the temptation might be to
think that when they&#39;re with their kids
they&#39;re bad fathers but that&#39;s just not
the case a study comparing fathers of
different races with kids ages one
through four african-americans took
three out of the top four spots they ate
with their kids more they bathed and
dress their kids more they read to their
kids more and they almost played with
their kids more than any other day with
kids ages 5 to 18 they again took three
out of the top four spots my many years
because of experience can attest this
african-americans are simply naturally
amazing dads so why are so many apps
that&#39;s the question isn&#39;t it and it&#39;s
also a whole nother TED talk it really
is but really quickly I want to point to
two the first one is you can probably
guess dates back to the earliest days of
our country Isabelle Wilkinsons amazing
qulet your prize-winning book spells it
out really well there&#39;s an old saying
that children inherit their parents
paint well we as Americans allow
african-american kids to inherit the
many many many J&#39;s generations of pain
and injustice that African Americans
have faced and that affects math
American fathers today the second reason
that african-american males are
separated from their kids is that they
are jailed at a much higher rate than
any other segment of our population
we jailed more african-american males
just the males then the whole prison
population all rates all genders the
whole prison population of India and
Argentina and Canada and leb in Japan
and Germany and Finland and Israel and
England combined you take all the
prisoners from all nine of those
countries and put them together in one
spot and you still do not have as many
african-american males as we have locked
up in our country India alone is more
than three times as large a country as
we are african-americans make up just
13% of the US population but 38% of the
prison population and they serve nearly
20 percent longer prison sentences than
a white male convicted of the exact same
crime famous rapper named Tupac who was
later shot and killed wrote when he was
young those that knew me would easily
cosign that no one has had a life as
hard as mine no father no money no
chance and no died I only followed the
voice inside in so many ways these kids
are set up to fail african-american
males have been systematically removed
from society and children have been
robbed of their fathers we hand them
that pain the day they were born society
also tells these kids they are at risk
youth imagine how you would feel if your
whole childhood you were told you were
at risk instead of full of potential you
live in fear right a study by Columbia
University labeled instead of calling
them at risk they call them
opportunities and the study revealed
between the ages of 16 and 24 there are
6 million opportunities and each one
costas on average 6 to 700 thousand
dollars over the course of their
lifetime they pass they are more prone
to hit the criminal justice system
welfare public health care and they pass
the same patterns on to their kids
shai the handsome fellow I mentioned
before was paired with a positive male
role model when he was just 15 when he
graduated he wrote his mentor and said I
don&#39;t know where I would be without you
so how did it get here let me tell you
real quick about 12 years ago I went
from a great career in technology
working at companies like Microsoft&#39;s a
microsystem singular to teaching high
tech at a very small community center in
the urban core it was one of the best
decisions of my life and it really
changed me in some wonderful ways I
worked there for seven years and I took
mental notes and what I felt were the
main issues and there was one issue that
stood out far above all the others one
issue that hurts the most kids the most
families the most number of times and
that was lack of positive male role
models single mothers can only do so
much right single mothers are super
heroes they are the anything and
everything for their kids but they are
often stretched beyond their limit
because they have to be for their kids
and they often have problems of their
own and anxiety employment problems
domestic issues I saw kids with all the
potential in the world erode over time
without the support of a strong male
figure and it made me mad not just as a
parent but as a problem solver to think
to see the same issue happening over and
over and over again the other thing I
noticed when I was there is that almost
every year I worked there a great guy
and it&#39;s early mid-20s would come and
work there for about a year great guys
you would trust him with kids
responsible they had made it through
high school but they didn&#39;t go to
college I went to college base because I
didn&#39;t have a choice it was a you know a
paved road and I could see the next stop
graduation but these guys couldn&#39;t even
see the road much less the next stop and
so their struggle continued however
while I was working there I became aware
of an organization called friends of the
children and they take kindergartners
who are in the most danger parents are
incarcerated on drugs what have you and
they give them a paid professional
mentor all the way through high school
$10,000 a year for 12 and a half years
one hundred and thirty thousand dollars
for one kid amazing friends has helped
thousands of kids from Harlem New York
to Cornwall England and has been doing
paid professional mentorship for more
than 20 years they have the outcomes to
prove that it works and a Harvard study
to show that it&#39;s more than worth the
financial investment
this little idea began to grow in my
mind why not take the friends of the
children model a proven model that works
and it&#39;s applied to the two big issues I
saw every day kids desperately needed
positive male role models and positive
male role models desperately needed help
getting to and through college what
better way for a kid to imagine himself
in college than seeing somebody a lot
like himself in college he comes from
the same place I do if he can do it so
can all and suddenly the road appears
the next stop appears for them and an
organization my wife and I have devoted
our lives to is born I mention
organizations called lust it stands for
mentoring urban students and teens
mentoring is a must must is a four-year
mentoring program we find and hire
positive african-american male role
models who want to pursue their higher
education and we pay them well to mentor
african-american males who are genuinely
in danger of dropping out of high school
the model can work with young women
Latinos foster care this is just who we
are spending time with and what makes
the model unique is that our mentors are
so highly relatable and we&#39;re helping
both the youth and the mentor break the
cycles in which they&#39;ve been living and
here&#39;s what it looks like during the
year we taught that guys like mr.
Marquez coached on the community and
find positive male role models I&#39;m a
parent I have four boys I understand the
risks involved I look at it as if these
guys will be mentoring my own kids and
in many wonderful ways they do end up
mentoring my own kids we do background
checks drug tests interview people all
around them getting a sense of who they
really are and we hire respectable
mentors guys who are going to go to the
University and get good grades and guys
who are kind of scared they&#39;re not going
to make it through Community College but
all of our mentors get the support they
need and they have the support they need
to get all the way through college we
ask our mentors to try and commit to
four years to the use that they&#39;ll be
mentoring they have PhDs and experience
and we pay them well for that experience
they start at about 20 dollars an hour
for 16 hours a month for each youth that
they&#39;re mentoring there are not enough
programs that serve the 18 to 25 year
old age range of our mentors they
among the most valuable resources in the
urban core and we should treat them like
gold seriously like gold wrapped and
platinum with a diamond on it they have
the power to rewrite X 2 &amp; 3 for every
kid they touch to literally take them in
an entirely new direction in life plus
society saves seven hundred thousand
dollars per kid because that kid will
grow up to be a regular guy like you and
me not in prison not shot and killed and
this brain we work with middle school
counselors to find youth who are
genuinely in danger of dropping out of
high school we have nine criteria not
nine criteria that are strong indicators
of youth dropping out low grades more
than twenty absences from school parents
are incarcerated and then in between the
use eighth-grade year in freshman year
of high school they&#39;re paired with a
mentor that looks like them it talks
like them and the four year relationship
begins this is the last stop for many of
them if you do not reach them now they
could be gone forever
Youth meet with their mentors for
breakfast once a week during the school
year they talk about everyday things
like boys talk about with their fathers
relationships sports but remember the
whole we&#39;re trying to fill is positive
male role models so we also talk about
something we call eight things that make
a man and each year both mentor and
youths are asked to work on just two of
the eight the first one is a man does
the dishes no that&#39;s not first but man
doesn&#39;t do the dishes by dad taught me
that makes dad know the first one is a
man is reliable he do what you say the
second one is a man owns his mistakes
just getting those two down gives any
guy jumpstart on life every other
weekend we go and do fun and new
experiences as a group movies go cards
tour the university life skill classes
the activities keep them off the street
and connected to the program but often
provide experiences they would not have
otherwise one youth has been with a
program while said the other day that
the best memories of my life are with
you guys and plus they&#39;re building
relationships with other guys that are
in the same direction we say show me
your friends and I&#39;ll show you your
future
our mentors don&#39;t go to the loan they&#39;re
assigned volunteer coaches who are older
successful men in the community who&#39;ve
agreed to meet weekly with the mentor to
help them navigate college and to be a
great mentor a better man only 11% of
first-generation students will finish
college so the relationship with the
coach is another positive male role
model are really vital to what we do I&#39;m
sure you know this but mentoring works a
study funded by the Gates Foundation
reported equality short-term mentoring a
nine-month average reduces depression
increases grades increases social
acceptance but you need long-term
outcome based mentoring like ours with
highly relatable mentors to really help
with deviant behavior sexual activity
substance abuse this is shy today
tackling college it&#39;s not easy but it is
opportunity happening right now we are
seeing guys who would have dropped out
of high school go to college and
probably become mentors for us if that
does not get you excited you gotta check
your pulse right now I want to tell you
a story that will happen in my
neighborhood in the Rainier Valley of
Seattle Washington Act one will call
childhood a healthy african-american
baby with all the promise of potential
and new born brings this born into a
great family with a great dad people
deal with them play with them read to
him act to my school or the next stop
he&#39;s going to do really well in high
school because his parents are on him
best grades and because his dad had a
positive male role model when he was at
high school
we checked his grades every week and
taught him what it means to be a man act
3 after high school the world is the
limit for this guy rocket scientist
world&#39;s famous scholar or just a regular
guy like you and I who has compassion
for others and sees ourselves worthy of
spectacular awesome regular lives
my personal mission my hope is to
preserve the potential every child is
born with to give them the potential to
shine to rise to be whoever they can be
and not what their early life
circumstances condemned them to be thank
you very much
[Applause]
