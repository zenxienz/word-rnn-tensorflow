so if I can get just a quick show of
hands how many people learned in school
that in 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean
blue and proved to everyone that the
world is actually round anyway right
this is one of the first memorable
nuggets of information that we learned
about the Middle Ages but the trouble is
it&#39;s not true people already knew that
the earth was a sphere and there&#39;s
plenty of evidence to show it for
starters here&#39;s a picture of England&#39;s
Richard ii in Westminster Abbey about
hundred years before Columbus sailed and
in his hand he&#39;s got a globe to show his
power on earth here&#39;s a picture that&#39;s
now in Belgium&#39;s royal library from
about 30 years before Columbus sailed
and in it you can see the earth the sky
a fiery atmosphere and the star is
beyond in fact well over a thousand
years before Columbus ever got on a boat
the ancient Greeks had calculated the
circumference of the earth using
geometry and modern measurements show
they were only about 70 meters off a
distance so small that our Olympians can
run it in about seven seconds so I can
show you plenty more evidence and point
to the many times that historians have
disproved the Flat Earth thing but what
I really want to talk to you today about
is why we continue to tell and retell
this myth and why we need to change our
thinking when we learn about history the
emphasis is often placed on those things
that we find hilarious or shocking and
pretty much everything that we take in
afterwards confirms that negative
impression we watched movies and TV
shows that emphasize brutality and bad
decisions and we tell ourselves stories
about how people were primitive and
superstitious
how they never bothered to get clean how
they were unscientific and unreasonable
and we pass along this information
without actually wondering if we&#39;re
looking at the whole picture we carry
around this notion that because we&#39;re
the latest models of humankind and
because we have a lot of access to
information that means that we are
smarter than the people who live before
us
we&#39;d like to think of history as a story
of continuous forward progress from left
to right
at the pinnacle us and in a way this is
perfectly natural especially if we
accept Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution but
if we look back to a common Western idea
of civilization so say three thousand
years that&#39;s only about a hundred and
twenty generations not enough to have
made any real significant evolutionary
progress I mean men still have nipples
right so we&#39;re not x-men yet and it&#39;s
gonna be a while before him get there
and what this means in practical terms
is that our brains are just about
indistinguishable from the brains that
built the pyramids and the brains that
wrote Magna Carta and the brains that
lived and loved on Turtle Island long
before Columbus now they may not have
had the same technology that we do but
they had our innate intelligence and so
you bring someone forward from the past
I bet that once they got over the
culture shock they&#39;d be just as good at
using a smartphone as we are now besides
me telling you that you need to cut your
great-great granny some slack question
as always is so what why does it matter
if we underestimate the smarts of our
ancestors it has a historian I can tell
you that everybody thinks that their
moment is crucial or pivotal and I could
also tell you that everybody&#39;s right
there&#39;s never a real insignificant
moment but this moment right now we are
facing some huge challenges climate
change artificial intelligence
overcrowding space exploration and if we
choose to dismiss all of history before
living memory then we miss out on the
chance to learn from people who have
experienced similar things before for
example one of the easiest periods for
us to dismiss is a so-called Dark Ages
which happened between what people call
the fall of the Roman Empire and around
the Norman conquest of England
so really roughly about 500 to 1100 AD
and I think that when we picture this
time in our minds we picture a little
mud and people carrying torches and
drawn swords because that&#39;s what we see
in our storytelling but the truth is
that people are writing books and
they&#39;re creating music in art at this
time just does that any other time and
one of the things they
creating we&#39;re books of home remedies
for common illnesses this is balls leech
book it&#39;s one of the many treasures in
the British Library and it contains all
sorts of really interesting information
like advice on how to cure madness by
whipping someone with a pork biscuit
what we&#39;re looking at right now is a
cure for infected eyes and it&#39;s a
mixture of garlic and wine and cow bile
you put it all together and you let it
steep for nine days and then you apply
it to your eye by the feather now
there&#39;s a lot about this that seems
pretty far-fetched and we might dismiss
all the bugs leech book based on the
porpoise suggestion alone but this
recipe has recently been recreated at
the University of Nottingham with some
surprising results it turns out that
it&#39;s pretty great at killing a super bug
called mr sa in fact it looks like it
may be more effective or faster at
killing mr sa than the leading
antibiotic now this is important because
as we keep using more and more
antibiotics more and more bacteria are
becoming resistant to them because
bacteria evolve a lot faster than we do
so it&#39;s really important that we keep
looking for new cures for these
superbugs now not saying that we should
start whipping people with porpoise
skins to see that work what I am saying
and we need to give our ancestors a bit
more credit for their knowledge of the
natural world they used to pact wounds
with peat moss because it led to fewer
infections and we now know that the
moulds that grow in peat moss have
antibiotic properties they chewed and
they brood willow bark to cure pain and
fever and that we now synthesize
something very similar to make aspirin
in fact in ancient Rome they used
electric eels for shock therapy such as
migraines and chronic pain and while
many of not most of the cures that
happen before the 20th century involved
reciting a prayer or an incantation we
can now measure the effects of positive
thinking on the healing process
now balls leech book is called the leech
book because leech is an anglo-saxon
word for doctor doctors used to use
leech
to reduce swelling by draining excess
blood and modern medicine has come back
around to using leeches for the same
purpose just as they&#39;ve come back around
to using maggots to clear dead flesh
from otherwise healthy wounds it&#39;s true
in fact the American Food and Drug
Administration regulates leeches and
maggots as medical devices and they have
since 2004
so sometimes timeless wisdom can be
pretty gross but it works now certainly
and not all these cures are gonna be as
effective as we might hope but here&#39;s
aren&#39;t the only thing that we can learn
from looking at the works of history&#39;s
doctors and healers one of the most
devastating things to ever happen to
humankind
with the Black Death which hit Europe in
1347 killing between a third and a half
of the entire population so if you look
around this room and you picture between
a third and half of people just gone you
get an idea of what the death toll was
like no history books make the most of
the silliest of plague remedies but I
think it&#39;s fair to say that if half of
this audience with dying of plague the
other half would do just about anything
to survive and some of the things they
did like smelling stirring the flowers
probably wouldn&#39;t have worked but other
things would have helped for example the
word quarantine comes to us from the
40-day isolation period imposed on
infected ships during the Black Death
now some people did go around praying
and whipping themselves because they
thought it might please God but that
didn&#39;t mean that everybody gave up on an
earthly cure French doctor said sure
definitely pray but this does not mean
forsaking doctors for the most high
created earthly medicine and although
God alone cures the sick he does so
through the medicine which in his
generosity he&#39;s provided those they in
French doctors in 1348 at the University
of Paris were asked to come up with
their best guesses as to where the
plague came from and how to stop it and
I think that moderns might think that
the beginning of their work was kind of
silly because it&#39;s mostly about
astrology but then they get into the
possible environmental causes the entire
last year they said has had unexpected
winter was warmer than usual summer was
colder but the whole of last year was
unseasonally wet and they quote into
Greek wisdom and say a year of many fogs
and damp says a year of many illnesses
something every modern kindergarten
teacher can attest they also thought
that the plague might have been caused
by something they called corrupted air
and that the corrupted air may have been
stirred up by weather or recent
earthquakes because everyone has to
breathe they said everyone is at risk
from the corrupted air and it turns out
that they were right modern scientists
and historians now believe that the
Black Death is a combination of bubonic
and pneumonic plague meaning it started
out being transmitted through infected
flea bites but then it evolved to be
transmitted through airborne droplets
spread by coughing and sneezing so in
that sense it definitely was breathing
that would get you sick and scientists
have also used ice core samples and
triggering data to show that weather is
indeed connected to epidemic disease do
the most devastating plagues in history
the plague of Justinian which hit the
Mediterranean in the sixth century and
the Black Death which hit Europe Asia
and Africa in the 14th century both
followed periods of massive volcanic
activity and unceasingly wet weather and
it looks like the recurrences of plague
that happened all the way up into
Shakespeare&#39;s day followed similar
weather pattern so suddenly looking back
at the weather that immediately preceded
the Black Death seems very important and
it is as we all know our climate is
changing rapidly and the bacterium that
was directly responsible for the plague
of Justinian the Black Death and the
third plague pandemic which killed
millions in the 19th century that
bacterium called Yersinia pestis still
exists in hot spots in Asia Africa and
even the United States know we can kill
your senior pestis with antibiotics
provided we&#39;re ready so it&#39;s really
important that we learn as much as we
can about historical outbreaks so that
we can be better for
haier next time and because people wrote
down symptoms and the path of the
devastation we can now follow the
skeletal remains and plague burial pits
and learn more about how the disease
grew and spread and we can plan for
other outbreaks of different epidemic
diseases now like superbugs and climate
change related illness another super
modern problem that we can use some help
with is the dilemma of artificial
intelligence No believe it or not
clockwork robots existed as far back as
the ancient world and everywhere from
Japan to the Middle East this is monk
bot
he is a 16th century robot which he can
find in the Smithsonian and his robe is
removed in this picture so you can see
the gears that allowed him to move
around and greet people now historical
robots are a far cry from the androids
that we have today or the programs that
are creating their own languages but
theologians and philosophers have been
debating for millennia what makes us
different from that what makes us human
Aristotle thought it was reason and the
drive for excellence Thomas Aquinas
thought it was the desire to know God
Mencius
an ancient Chinese philosopher believed
that humans have innate compassion know
as our brilliant machines become more
brilliant and perhaps more like us it
makes sense to go back and look at those
things that we&#39;ve always said separate
us from the other species now looking
back to the past for help with science
and technology seems like a bit of a
stretch what about the many ways in
which our ancestors tried to help us
with practical wisdom the ancient
Mesopotamians were wise enough to tell
us not to make big decisions while
drinking heavily
medieval courtly lovers told us to
beware of gold diggers medieval monks
built green space into their monasteries
to rest the souls and the eyes of the
brothers who&#39;ve been sitting at desks
all day ancient Egyptian and Greek women
told us to use a contraceptive if we
don&#39;t want to get pregnant they use
pomegranate seeds and animal dung to
increase their estrogen and disrupt
their pH pretty much everything on the
modern magazines
and has been covered at one time or
another monks from all different
religions over millennia have been
teaching us how to find inner peace get
enough sleep eat in moderation meditate
be grateful 15th century writers told us
to have respect and find education for
women and girls ancient philosopher is
like the Stoics told us to live a life
of disciplined virtue
although Confucius said I have yet to
meet the man who likes virtue as much as
he loved sex
elders and indigenous cultures continue
to pass on practical and philosophical
wisdom including the very smart advice
of paying attention to the wisdom of
your elders know what I love about
history is the many different ways in
which our ancestors tried to help us to
leave better lives to learn from their
mistakes and their heartache they don&#39;t
always get it right
like the porpoise thing sometimes they
don&#39;t even get most things right and
sometimes they just serve it as an
example of who we don&#39;t ever want to be
but when we take our current living
relatives and friends advice with a
grain or two of salt we let them sit at
the table with us to share their ideas
we really need to let our ancestors sit
at the table with us and hear what they
have to say and why they say it instead
of just missing their knowledge as
primitive or superstitious because it&#39;s
old or we don&#39;t understand the thinking
behind it technology hasn&#39;t necessarily
made us a little smarter if you don&#39;t
believe me remember that well hundreds
and thousands of years ago people knew
the earth was a sphere there are people
today that can look at photos from space
and still believe it&#39;s flat now I&#39;m not
saying all the answers are in the past
if they were we&#39;d have no problems left
to solve but what I am saying is that if
we find ourselves using words like
primitive or superstition when we talk
about the past that we look to make sure
that there&#39;s evidence to support those
conclusions and that&#39;s not just our
tendency to
see history is a straight-line of
progress this is our moment in time and
we are facing immense challenges to meet
them we can draw on the wisdom of the
billions of people living on earth right
now and we can draw on the wisdom of the
billions of people who lived on the
planet before us but first we have to
see history in three dimensions and
really consciously take note of people&#39;s
brilliance and their successes as well
as their failures as hilarious because
those may be there is so much that we
don&#39;t know about the past and so many
exciting discoveries are making every
day but if we choose to ignore the
wisdom of the past or if we continue to
rip misrepresented by perpetuating myths
and stereotypes they were adding
exponentially to the things that we
don&#39;t know and we&#39;re limiting our
ability to solve current problems we can
do better we can respect the past we can
learn from it and we can build ourselves
a bright future thank you
[Applause]
