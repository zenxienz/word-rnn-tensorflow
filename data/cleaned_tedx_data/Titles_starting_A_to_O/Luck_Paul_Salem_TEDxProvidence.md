I was supposed to be on that flight Pan
Am flight 103 it blew up over the skies
of Lockerbie Scotland on December 21st
1988 and I had a ticket booked on that
flight 243 passengers died that day 16
crew died and 11 innocent victims on the
ground all died because of a silly
random awful terrorist attack and I&#39;m
going to tell you today why I wasn&#39;t on
that plane and why I think luck in
believing that you&#39;re lucky is the most
important thing that you can have in
life so I was 25 years old living in
London England having the greatest time
I had a job at the Prudential Insurance
Company I was young fun couldn&#39;t have
been happier but every once in a while I
got homesick I&#39;ll never forget
Thanksgiving celebrating Thanksgiving in
London with a bunch of Americans it just
didn&#39;t feel right having Thanksgiving in
a foreign land just as not the same as
being at home so next day work Monday
morning I called the travel agent they
said hey I want to go home for Christmas
I want the cheapest flight possible I
want to go from London Heathrow to Logan
and Boston traveling said cheapest
flight possible as you go from Heathrow
to JFK on Pan Am flight 103 then you
take a shuttle from New York to Boston
they&#39;ll land at 8 o&#39;clock at night and
Logan I said let&#39;s book it so I booked
the flight call my parents super excited
that I&#39;m coming home for Christmas mom
dad I&#39;ll be coming home I land on the
21st can you pick me up that Logan of
course we can pick you up at Logan can&#39;t
wait to see you couldn&#39;t wait to go home
two weeks later so it&#39;s a week before
I&#39;m about to fly my colleague at work I
said hey what are you doing for
Christmas I said I&#39;m going home cuz oh
are you flying home on the company dime
so what are you talking about because
you know as an expat you&#39;re an American
living in a foreign country
you actually get one free round-trip
ticket home a year and I said how come I
don&#39;t know about this he goes it&#39;s in
the company manual and I said do we have
a company manual I didn&#39;t even know we
had a company manual so my colleague
shows me the company manual and sure
enough I&#39;m looking at it and I get one
free round-trip ticket home so I run
into my boss and say hey I get a free
round-trip ticket I just booked a
one-way through New York it&#39;s a pain in
the neck you know can I can i you know
have Prudential paid for this ticket my
boss said fine I call the exact travel
agent same person said hey do you mind
if we switch flights says well that was
a non-refundable ticket but you get a
it&#39;s a free round-trip ticket what do
you care you can go British Airways
London Heathrow directly to to Boston I
said well what time does it get in funny
enough it got in the same exact time as
when I had been coming in from the
shuttle from New York City so December
21st comes around all excited get the
Heathrow the security lines were out of
control I was sitting up next with an
extra strange I said what&#39;s going on
today
I mean don&#39;t security line wasn&#39;t moving
I was worried as actually to miss my
flight
so anyway barely make it to the flight
get on the British Air flight flied
directly to to Logan in Boston get
through customs go get my bags super
excited to see my parents hadn&#39;t seen
him in a year I come out see all these
people holding signs looking for my
parents didn&#39;t know where to be found
like this is weird
actually I&#39;m kind of pissed I&#39;m like
I&#39;ve been home for a year where the hell
are they so I go to a payphone yes I
went to a payphone this there was no
cell phones no texts no emails back in
1988 okay so I call my mom answers the
phone said mom where are you
it&#39;s Paul and she gasped you and she
couldn&#39;t speak and in my mind I&#39;m
thinking holy cow my dad has been sick
maybe he just you know he had a
heart attack a couple years early maybe
that&#39;s why they&#39;re not here they&#39;re not
here because you know my dad&#39;s sick I&#39;m
like mom I&#39;m here at Logan what where
are you she literally was like crying
so I said to her I go you know
mom mom and she hands the phone to my
older brother my brother gets on a phone
and goes where the f4u and I go well
we&#39;re the f4u I&#39;m at Logan why is there
no one here to pick me up and he goes
your flight the flight you took from
Heathrow it blew up I&#39;m like what are
you talking about a blew up he goes were
you on the Pan Am flight I said no I
switched it last week because you didn&#39;t
tell us I go well what do you mean I and
I was I was speechless
the plane blew up as I was leaving
London I didn&#39;t know it blown up I get
to Logan my parents were six hours
Colin Pan American Airways trying to
figure out what was going on just as
soon as I was dead well I got lucky that
day I wasn&#39;t on that plane and I&#39;m still
haunted by the 270 people who did die
because of this random act of violence
and it&#39;s hard to really fathom all this
unless you know you search for an
explanation and the only explanation I
could find was that I do believe I&#39;m the
luckiest person alive and let me tell
you how I came about believing I&#39;m lucky
it all started with this guy this is my
dad my hero email Salem the most
positive upbeat guy you&#39;d ever meet in
your life if I would walk outside and
he&#39;d say and I&#39;d say ah dad it&#39;s cloudy
it hit me in the back of the head and
say no today&#39;s a great day I grew up
with a dad that everything was sunny he
told me from an early age I was born
under a lucky star he used to read these
books by norman vincent peale called the
power of positive thinking and he
if you put your mind to it you can
achieve anything in I mean it was at
dinner at breakfast at lunch he always
kept on telling me how lucky I was so
eventually you start believing it but
you know when you&#39;re a teenager some of
that talk about luck usually goes in one
ear and help the other so I&#39;ll tell you
a little story about you know we we grew
up on a lake
and we had a boat that was my form of
entertainment I wasn&#39;t old enough to
drive but I could take the boat out so I
told my mom I&#39;m dad I&#39;m going out for a
little boat ride and I go pick up my
buddy we stopped at a dock we go buy
some beer now we had fake IDs back then
and drinking age is 18 wasn&#39;t so bad and
we met a couple girls and we had a great
party that night we partied in the boat
we had a ball kind of pull in maybe a
little too late to my dog sneaked back
in my house and didn&#39;t get caught things
were pretty good so the next morning I
wake up and I was put on my running
clothes because I had I was training for
this ice hockey tour my was a pretty
good hockey player in my day and I had
to go get in shape for this summer
league ice hockey tournament I was
playing in so I put on my running shoes
and my shorts went for a jog I didn&#39;t
even make it a quarter mile I started
throwing up I come back I got my head
down I walked out of the dock I go in
the lake I&#39;m washing myself off and I
look inside the boat a bunch of empty
beer bottles a bag of pot some women&#39;s
clothing and a pink comb so I get the
beer bottles I throw them in the trash
they take the clothing I hide it in the
boat I take the bag of pot and I throw
it in the lake and I have this pink comb
in my hand and all of a sudden my mum
starts walking down from the house
towards the dock they take the pink comb
I put it in my back pocket right right
where my running shorts were and I just
like you know hey mom you know I&#39;m not
feeling so well she goes yeah I thought
you going out for a jog yeah I got to
the end of the street I threw up
and she puts her hand on my forehead oh
you must be sick are you okay only a
mother can be so nice and and she goes
once you go up and take a shower and and
you know I&#39;ll make you some tea and
toast
so as I&#39;m taking off my running clothes
and I&#39;m gonna hop in the shower
this pink comb falls on the bathroom
floor I take the pink comb put it up on
the van I take a shower and for whatever
reason as I&#39;m combing my hair that day I
start combing it with the pink comb I
look in the mirror and I say man I got a
changed my life this is really not good
you know I&#39;m supposed to be this good
athlete I should be training I can&#39;t
even make it to the end of the street
and I&#39;m really letting my parents down
next day I go for a jog take a shower I
actually made it a few miles this time
and there&#39;s that pink comb I comb my
hair again with it and I said you know
what my dad&#39;s been telling me how lucky
I better I better capitalize on my luck
so that was when I was 16 years old and
I had my birthday last week and you know
sure enough I still have that pink comb
38 years later for the you that can&#39;t
see it for you that can&#39;t see it I comb
my hair with this pink comb every single
day and every day I tell myself I&#39;m the
luckiest person in the world I know I&#39;m
making my dad proud by doing that but
this is my little cue to just say that I
can achieve just about anything in life
so it&#39;s been 38 years the good news is I
still have hair so that&#39;s always good
and you know I have achieved some some
success in my life and and I think about
why have I achieved this success you
know I did go to Brown University I
graduate in 1985
I went to four years working at
Prudential
couple years in London one in New York
one in San Francisco and then I went to
Harvard Business School and in 1991 I
graduated from Harvard Business School
and I joined up with a couple fellow
Brown and Harvard Business School grads
and we actually built up a company
called Providence Equity Partners we
started with 171 million dollars and
today we manage about 52 billion
so we&#39;ve had tremendous success it&#39;s
probably the most successful investment
firm in Rhode Island that no one knows
about and we like it that way so we&#39;ve
had this tremendous success and and you
know when I sit down with our young
professionals and I talked to high
school kids now I tell them that you
know success is all about believing that
you can be successful that you can be
lucky so let me just tell you a little
story when I was graduating from Brown
University I was a senior who Browns a
pretty good school right you figured not
so hard to get a job well I sent out a
thousand resumes I think I would get a
medal just for sending out the resumes
and guess how many resumes like how many
rejection letters I got back I got a
thousand rejection letters I actually
filled up our whole wall in our
apartment at Brown with my roommates
just all the rejection letters we should
have rejection letter parties and one
time I was in New York and I had my
backpack with me and I&#39;m walking down
Park Avenue York and I see one on one
Park Ave and I was like you know what I
got a rejection letter from their dress
101 Park Ave was consulting firm I
happened to have it with me in my
backpack so I took out the rejection
letter and I said Wow 101 Park Ave so
what did I do
I walked right in that building was the
27th floor and I asked for the woman who
rejected me
her name was Sheila Smith and I went up
to reception I said Sheila Smith please
she goes do you have an appointment I go
no I don&#39;t have an appointment but I
have this letter here and I just like to
see it for five minutes
receptionist calls Miss Smith and she&#39;s
kind of whispering in the phone and then
she goes I&#39;m sorry mrs. Smith is busy
she can&#39;t see you and I said hey I just
came down from Providence Rhode Island
took a three hour train ride can&#39;t you
spare five minutes just to see me
and of course mrs. Smith said no so I
said to the receptionist I said you know
what I&#39;m not leaving until she comes out
and of course I had a train to catch but
it was two hours away so I had nothing
to lose I&#39;m thinking all this wait here
matter of fact it was a lot nicer
waiting there and then waiting in in
Grand Central Station so so I ended up
just sitting there and finally I think
got a guilt mrs. Smith came out and she
was carrying this big computer printout
and she goes what&#39;s your name said Paul
Salem she starts Salem Paul we rejected
you I go no kidding I got your letter
right here I got your letter right here
and is that printout is that stack of
papers is that all rejection letters she
says yes it is I go do you think there&#39;s
any chance that you might have made a
mistake and she says well um we got a
lot of candidates and I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t
help you I said well at least you know
mrs. Smith thank you for coming out
that&#39;s all I asked I just wanted to see
you for five minutes thank you for your
time and I leave they caught my train
what did I have to lose nothing I get
back to brown I told my roommates that
story

7:30 in the morning the next day the
next day I&#39;m sound asleep I&#39;m in college

don&#39;t forget no one gets up at 7:30 in
the morning phone rings I answer the
phone I&#39;m sound asleep
as Paul Salem there please yes this is
fall this is shit Sheila Smith someone
canceled you&#39;d like to have an interview

today at 1:00 p.m. in New York like yeah
hop back on the train I go to New York I

have my 1:00 p.m. interview guess what
happened I did not get the job I got
rejected I got rejected so why did I
just waste your time telling you that
story well I&#39;ll tell you why so next
week I&#39;m interviewing for the Prudential
Insurance Company of America and on my
resume it said I&#39;m lucky and ambitious
so my dad&#39;s brainwashing really did work
out and like the guy that was
interviewing me was a pretty senior guy
and he goes I&#39;ve never seen someone on
their resume say lucky and ambitious
tell me about that so I told him about
my dad and how you know he was this you
know crazy guy that loved to tell me how
lucky I was and he loved that story and
then he says tell me about being
ambitious so I told him the story I just
told you about 101 Park Ave and how I
demanded an interview and the guy hired
me on the spot and that&#39;s how I got my
job at Prudential and just to tie it all
together
that same guy that hired me also wrote
my recommendation to Harvard Business
School so I don&#39;t know if I ever would
have gotten in without him at Harvard
Business School and to add one more part
to the happy-ending Prudential Insurance
was the first investor in Providence
Equity Partners so when I think about
all the amazing luck that I&#39;ve had over
my life the fact that I was never afraid
to fail because I had a dad that told me
I&#39;m the luckiest human being in the
world that I was born under a lucky star
when you know you&#39;re going through life
lucky you don&#39;t care if you fail because
what can go wrong nothing someone says
no who cares and what I want to tell you
about today is I want every one how many
people this audience actually think
they&#39;re lucky raise your hand if you
think you&#39;re lucky okay that&#39;s good
there should be a
hundred percent people thinking you&#39;re
lucky because it&#39;s a great way to go
through life think about it if you
believe you&#39;re lucky you will be lucky
luck is believing you&#39;re lucky and when
opportunity falls in your lap you don&#39;t
let it hit the ground
you make sure you capitalize on that
luck and when you think about it what I
want you to remember from my talk today
is that you go find your pink comb it
could be brushing your teeth every day
it could be putting your socks on
combing your hair blow-drying your hair
whatever you do you do something every
single day and every day you do that
monotonous task just remind yourself how
lucky because if you go through life
good things can happen I&#39;m living proof
of that thank you
[Applause]
