I&#39;m going to tell you the story of a day
in which two things happened
simultaneously one which was semi common
and didn&#39;t really mean that much on its
own and the other which I thought was
everything because these two things
happened at the same time I thought this
this is my peak this day and everything
after will be the meaning and my life
and become the person I was supposed to
be I want it to be clear before I tell
the story that I was wrong in this
situation I was a victim I didn&#39;t have
the power or knowledge to change the
thing that hurt me
I thought because of how badly it hurt
naturally I would become a survivor
being a survivor means having something
to show for your pain that you learned
something or you changed a thing that
happens where you put yourself in a
better position to fight against it for
the future
that you live a better life in some way
yeah not all survivors not all victims
can do that I certainly couldn&#39;t see I
didn&#39;t have the power or knowledge to
change or prevent the situation that
helped that happen to me I didn&#39;t have
any ability to make something good out
of it and because I thought I had to I
thought that&#39;s what bad situations
naturally are I held on to this for far
longer than healthy so I wanted two
things from this experience one I wanted
it to have a meeting I wanted to be a
better wiser stronger godly air person
because of this experience and this
experience specifically - I wanted other
people to see them I wanted another
source to validate my newfound strength
and wisdom and only then would I be okay
have I mentioned that I was wrong at so
to tell this story I&#39;m gonna need to
tell it a little out of order we&#39;ll talk
about the non important part and the
aftermath and saved the important bit
but the point of telling the story is
that this could happen to anyone this
doesn&#39;t have to be a specific situation
about me this could be anything that
makes you feel angry and unfinished that
makes you feel like it&#39;s a reflection on
you so just know that before I continue
to make a long story as short as I can
when I was at the end of junior year in
high school a girl took a non-consensual
photo of me circled my face and wrote
look I found the terrorists and uploaded
an online again this is the non
important part of the story as strange
as it sounds by this point in my life
I&#39;ve grown numb to racist comments and
I&#39;ve had worse things happen to me than
getting all the racial slurs if all that
happened here is I gotta call the
terrorists I wouldn&#39;t be giving a TED
talk right now
so I went to make this long story a
little bit longer sorry guys naturally
what happened was we were in our
theology class because theology is
boring and this girl was bored so she
took a photo of me and other students
saw it told her to take it down express
their disapproval and even though she
complained like a lot she naturally
listened to peer pressure and even
though she did take it down a girl
wasn&#39;t satisfied reported it to the Dean
the Dean saw it made her take it down
gave her a punishment that was supposed
to be the end of it I go to school like
everything&#39;s normal
I go into the hallway after my very
boring theology class and a friend of
mine walks up to me and asks are you
okay and I look at her and say uh yeah
why wouldn&#39;t I be
she then has to explain to me a
situation that is directly about me that
I know nothing about by this point my
first instinct was say like hey what&#39;s
this girl&#39;s name in the most colorful
language I could so I can report her to
the Dean I thought it is something to
just report get done with I move on but
she looks me dead in the eye and says
Sam drugs they they already know I
didn&#39;t what I I didn&#39;t really know how I
felt at this point see I was confused
kind of sad but I thought this is a
small enough situation that it shouldn&#39;t
be an inconvenience I should go on with
my day like normal
I went to my next class couldn&#39;t really
focus I used my lunch break to go and
see a counselor I asked her if she knew
what was going on but she wouldn&#39;t even
talk to me her first instinct even
though she didn&#39;t know what happened or
the situation that was going on was to
ask who told me and then shipped me off
to the Dean I didn&#39;t know why she would
ask as if I didn&#39;t have the right to
know but I trusted her so I told her the
name of my friend it wasn&#39;t until she
was walking me to the dean&#39;s office I
started to realize how wrong that
actually was I I almost wasn&#39;t surprised
when the Dean asked me the same thing
this time I said I wouldn&#39;t answer when
I didn&#39;t give her a name the Dean
disapproved she said well I don&#39;t see
why people are gossiping about it the
fact I had to explain it wasn&#39;t gossip
probably should have been my first red
flag I asked her why she didn&#39;t tell me
and she said it&#39;s a violation of the
other girl&#39;s privacy to tell you what
happened what this was something she did
on social media she openly admitted what
she did and openly complained about what
punishment she got but the Dean still
refused to even say her name I asked
about my privacy
I asked why there was a non-consensual
photo of me on the inert calling me a
terrorist and she knew but I did it I
was so confused I thought it was beneath
me to get upset over something like this
this was just supposed to be an
inconvenience I broke down crying in her
office and I didn&#39;t realize until later
it wasn&#39;t because some girl made an edgy
joke at my expense that I&#39;ve heard a
million times before but it was because
of the behavior of someone who&#39;s in
authority but as confused as I was I saw
this as an opportunity see this hurt me
to the point it was supposed to be
significant to my life that&#39;s how this
worked I was supposed to make impactful
change here so I told her about all of
my experiences with racism at the school
and she seemed willing to listen when I
left her office that day she asked if
there was anything she could
to make me feel better I told her and
just get over it of course that&#39;s where
it ended would have been terrible but I
wouldn&#39;t be talking about it right now
when I left her office she proceeded to
immediately call my mother which would
have made sense if she explained the
situation all she did was really try and
suck up to her at work before I can get
home and say like this is what happened
so when I went home it was like this is
what happened she insisted we meet with
the principal I&#39;m going to spoil the
story of it here the principal didn&#39;t
know what happened the Dean made a bad
call and chose to make something up on
her own some punishment that wasn&#39;t
fitting and which would have been
tolerable if they just openly sense him
instead they proceeded to lie to my
mother&#39;s face they made up some grand
story about how they met with four
people and an attorney and just decided
it wasn&#39;t legally best to tell me what
happened
the Dean denied the gossip comment from
a few days earlier the principal tried
to equate it to her finding a mean note
someone wrote about me and throwing it
away before anyone ever saw it my mother
stood up for me but I was almost
embarrassed that she did I understand I
was getting lied to and she was the only
person in the room taking it seriously
when she asked about using this as a
teaching tool for the student population
the principal proceeded to deflect all
responsibility to the theology
department of our school saying it was
somehow their responsibility in those
boring theology classes to ensure that
race issues didn&#39;t exist I didn&#39;t think
I was getting lied to but I was still
disgusted but the lack of compassion and
how they chose to handle it okay so
obviously this hurt
I still get upset talking about it now
but this is the part I left out that
makes it significant the day I got
called the terrorists the thing that
happened simultaneously the day before
all of this happened I had reconnected
with a friend who hadn&#39;t talked to me
for a few months this was someone really
close to me who was going through
something significant and it finally
opened up to me but I didn&#39;t know what
to say i rambled on and tried to say
anything that sounded right I&#39;d probably
talk
for 20 minutes straight and I couldn&#39;t
remember anything I said to you except
one thing I told her in the middle in a
rush state it&#39;s okay not to be okay and
she cut me off and told me that&#39;s
exactly what she needed to hear that
wasn&#39;t for me I don&#39;t speak in cliches
and my edgy high school time I thought
oh that&#39;s just a disingenuous way of
saying something I can make up in a much
prettier sounding Hallmark card II way I
thought that my words were better than
things that were clich√© for a reason I
didn&#39;t mean to say it so I ended the
night by looking in the mirror closing
eyes okay God you win make me something
you can use I think you can see why this
felt so significant now I took this as
the answer to my prayer this really big
bad thing was my cancer action I would
go through something worse than anything
I had ever been through before and be
better as a direct result my character
arc would be complete I would become the
person I was supposed to be I&#39;d be
recognized for my special wisdom my
hallmark hard words and someone would
look at me and say wow you&#39;re you&#39;re
doing such a good job and my pain would
end and I&#39;d be okay
I&#39;d be recognized as being a survivor
but of course there&#39;s no pre-written
script for the happy ending and I&#39;m not
the star this was just a bad really bad
thing that happened to me but because I
was treating it like the climax of my
life I made things so much worse for
myself it&#39;s okay to have scars and be
stronger because of them it&#39;s not okay
to make yourself a worse person and set
yourself so far back trying to find the
strength that you think it&#39;s supposed to
be there but life moves on right so the
day I got back to school the Dean the
counselor and the girl had a meeting
with
me I had to explain uh ya know you can&#39;t
take a non-consensual photo of someone
with the racist caption and put it on
your story sorry
surprise surprise she wasn&#39;t sorry
and me to get over it and the Dean and
the counselor thought I was being too
hard on her and while their continued
expectation that I just ignore it
get over it made me feel so much more
violated I it left me so reaffirmed in
my need for something tangible I was
going to be a survivor I would have
something that people could look to and
see this experience they can see this
strength and this would be who I was
yeah it uh it got to the point where I
wrote help directed and played myself in
a 1x play about race issues in a high
school I was such a mess I had so many
issues whenever my principal gave a
speech at school or at math I would
actively spread the story when I thought
she got too self-righteous only it
stopped being about teaching anyone
anything and it was more about making
them hate her as much as I grew to I was
a mess
it was a cringy mess who lived and
breathed victimhood it was all I was and
this attitude led to two things that
inspired my senior year two big events
one at the beginning one at the end at
the beginning was a retreat regardless
of if you were religious or not
everybody praised the functional weekend
retreat people were saying it changed
their lives in three days and they made
friends they want on their wedding party
one day
naturally the cringy professional victim
I was I thought this would be it this
would be my recognition I went and I
talked about the most significant thing
that had happened to me the first chance
I got but obviously it didn&#39;t stick
because I shared it at the first chance
I got and not in an organic way when
other people talked about what they&#39;d
went through that was significant to
them much like the night with my friend
I tried to say things that sounded
pretty but nothing stuck okay I didn&#39;t
have any special wisdom okay
was kind of just an ego thing I just cuz
I was the one talking didn&#39;t make it
useful or helpful to the people who are
trusting me the vulnerable parts of
themselves and so naturally I wasn&#39;t
chosen to lead any of these other
retreats that year and it kills me
watching these other girls flop likes
walk around the leaders and congratulate
each other and get emotional and happy
and for crying in the hallways these
girls would go on the three days that
were supposed to change their lives
killed me because they found community
and importance in an institution that
devastated me was a continuous remember
but I had nothing tangible to show for
what I went through I had wanted what
they had they found something here that
was valuable and important and I was
just sitting in my room upset every time
the retreat came around the second big
event was at the end of my senior year
my theology teacher of that year was
leaving our school because he got a job
offer from the Catholic Church he was
going to change the theology curriculum
many of the Catholic schools in America
so when I heard about this and I
remembered what my principal said to
avoid talking about race issues I wrote
him a letter it was six pages long I
explained what happened and he called me
into his office said he was sorry for
what happened to me I almost got excited
until I realized he was talking about me
getting called the terrorists as if the
worst thing in that whole story was
getting called a racial slur I was so
upset but here I&#39;m the one who got my
hopes up
I don&#39;t regret bringing what happened to
his attention because maybe he could
change something but I also wanted a
validation from him which I didn&#39;t get I
wanted him to see what happened and see
why it was significant to me and say
something about it
but he wasn&#39;t going to he was going to
use it for what he deemed fit because
that&#39;s he&#39;s a separate person and you
know what as much as I disagree with his
interpretation I have to stop looking
for the validation I want from another
source
no one on the outside it&#39;s gonna be like
I&#39;m sorry for what happened to you and
they&#39;re going to try and push me into
being better I had to do that for myself
I still had to be a person outside of
being victimized and I was convinced
that this label was going to resolve me
of any need to do work on myself and
that I was just going to be better
because other people would do it like
some tragic hero but naturally that&#39;s
not how the world works the only thing
is on my moral high horse I could have
told you the same thing back then I
wasn&#39;t found that old letter I have a
section where I talked about everything
I thought I learned and something stood
out to me I said it&#39;s okay to be angry
but eventually you&#39;ll have to forgive
and take your power back otherwise
you&#39;re just bitter here&#39;s the thing I I
knew back then this was about power and
re empowering myself but I didn&#39;t
actually feel it this entire section was
just pretty words stacked on top of each
other that I thought I knew but didn&#39;t
actually and never took any of it to
heart I thought I could be passive and
not use any of my power because I was
powerless when it happened and that
somehow someone else wouldn&#39;t see my
tragic here onus or whatever and I&#39;d
learn a lesson that someone else would
impose on me
I like the protagonist of some cliche
story that&#39;s not how the world works
even if I could have learned some things
from this experience because there&#39;s not
much to learn other than people calling
you a terrorist is bad it wouldn&#39;t be a
reflection on my identity because Who I
am more than the things that have hurt
me I still have to be a person outside
of it and what I do matters more because
guess what happened to me was terrible
but everything I did after was worse for
my own development I was I may be lost
friends by looking to validation and
looking for outside sources of approval
I wanted people to be like this is
important and I just wanted them to make
me a person I didn&#39;t want to have to try
anymore
and you know what I&#39;m the only one who
can make me better there&#39;s one more
thing from that that&#39;s kind of fitting
that letter I said life is more than
pretty words and impersonal speeches
well here&#39;s some words that are for once
just not pretty I&#39;m not a victim or a
survivor I&#39;m just healing because I&#39;m
the only one who can heal I&#39;m the only
one who would do this for myself and
I&#39;ll keep going because life is
continuous it&#39;s more than this one
struggle I&#39;ll be better and worse and
better and worse and struggle and be
better all over again because that&#39;s
what life is and if I wait for something
else to make me a person I&#39;ll never be
one
