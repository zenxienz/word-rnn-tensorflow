French words best croissant Baker&#39;s
Italians words loudest people Syrians
words new guests in a five-star hotel
called Germany and me what do you think
about me when you see me the truth is
whoever I am the most important thing is
what I made of it till now and how I
developed it into the society I&#39;m living
but how well this is my story in brief I
was born and raised in casablanca
morocco to the age of 21 and then my
parents encouraged me to go abroad see
more of the outside world choose the
country and do my master&#39;s degree there
after some thoughts I chose Germany
obviously and I remember at that time
that my dad was so surprised and at the
same time happy about my choice what
surprised because it was a bold choice
coming from a Moroccan girl who knows
absolutely no one in Germany and no
single word in German apart from its
limitation but I mean how could that
have been helped I mean and somehow
Moroccans or Moroccans know this
sentence how why I have absolutely no
idea and he was at the same time happy
because my dad is one of those people
that whenever he will see a German
product he will be so excited and happy
about it as if he actually participated
in producing it so when he will see a
fox fucking car he will say that we
check what he did or when he will see a
bosch mixer he will say Mohamed torchic
credited and partially because of this
enthusiastic and optimistic attitude of
my dad I just didn&#39;t want to disappoint
him nor my mother but I did and this is
how well you remember about this
master&#39;s degree that I chose to do in
Germany what I didn&#39;t tell you is a two
years master&#39;s program in civil
engineering but entirely in English that
means that during those whole two years
all I was doing
speaking in English not caring about
integrating with Germans or learning the
language and with the stress of exams
and student life I just didn&#39;t feel the
time passing by until one of my friends
asked me you&#39;ve been living in Germany
so how is it like to live in there how
are Germans I heard there are a special
case of your opinions is that true umm I
never answered simply because I couldn&#39;t
but then I started analyzing everything
backwards so now what changed that I
have a master&#39;s degree in civil
engineering but I could have done it in
Morocco right and then what else changed
but I&#39;m eating a lot of Catalan in self
couscous or but I&#39;m having an umbrella
under me instead of flip-flops in summer
but the situation that ranked about the
most is when I had to look for a job
after my master&#39;s degree I was so
confident at the beginning that I would
send all my applications in English
thinking that they would actually be
considered and little by little I
understood that this is just an illusion
there is no way out
to the situation but to learn the
language and get to know Germans so yes
I disappointed my father and myself
after 2 years being in Germany but it&#39;s
never too late right I made a decision
I&#39;m gonna be jobless for some time and
learn German on a daily basis that&#39;s
what I did and let me tell you that a
lot of things have changed since then I
was suddenly invited for interviews my
applications were suddenly considered I
mean I have been a foreigner before in
other countries but here your efforts
are extremely appreciated when you speak
the local language and actually I had
this situation where I had to look for a
job and it was the company of my dreams
and he prepared so well for it like all
the possible eventual classical
interview questions that could come up
because I was part so fluent in in
German and there will be of course I&#39;m
and
questions that I would not find the
perfect word for nevertheless I saw the
interest of the recruiters go in one
question after the other so I got
confused and by the end of the interview
they asked me if I had any questions
about the company and of course I have
also prepared that but the one and only
question that I naively thought about
asked it at that time was like hisui
happens the imaan of interest and minam
who feel of what each village crichton
me - hahaha and they answered that is
kind problem so a language in which we
attend it is part a new line of Hoggett
outside and this sentence kept me
motivated every single day I mean effort
and motivation are key to success and
integration
I haven&#39;t been accepted in that company
but they gave me the secret to be
accepted at least in the company I&#39;m
working on right now and within the
society I&#39;m livid in and that&#39;s really
important and they are right because if
I didn&#39;t make any full effort I would
discover that I have been eaten a couple
of times shinken thinking it was chicken
and I don&#39;t even eat pork but how could
I know we never had chicken in our
German classes and that when someone
comes and say Khadija my outside he
wasn&#39;t saying come Khadija I invite you
for a meal or when my colleagues at work
now say in the morning hello Khadija
listed they weren&#39;t treated many of
someone making jokes they were simply
saying hello hadiza Chris dish not to
mention that I was secretly noting down
the expressions that impressed me like
at first dr. blooms agony or each fish
the new Obon hope or my favorite word
pillar father I also discovered that the
German industry is not only about Fox
fuckin cars or Bosch mixers and for that
I say sorry dad but the good news are
for my dad is now I don&#39;t only feel a
part of this society I also feel like I
deserve to be part of it and the
language is a powerful communication
tool gave me the possibility and
opportunity to get into know you and you
get in to know me now I am no longer the
etiquette of just an Arab immigrants who
came here two years ago making no effort
to integrate now I can finally give
myself the label that truly defines me
the one of an Arab immigrants who came
here two years ago making it first and
fought for her future and I bet just
before coming or just before starting
the speech you all had a whole other
idea about me
and don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not blaming
you we all do it we all judge people
that we don&#39;t know at the beginning but
I feel like now I finally have this
possibility of giving myself the label
that truly defines me and I feel like my
efforts are finally paid off
I need it took me two years to do it but
better to use to wake up than to never
wake up and so when you think about this
three types of French people are just
good at baking class home and when you
integrate with them you realize that
they are not just
good at being Hassan or the Italians
that they are not just being loud they
could do a lot more than that cooking
good lasagna or the Syrians that they
didn&#39;t choose to live their countries
and their families to come here live
away from their people but don&#39;t get me
wrong we foreigners also have the
responsibility to clarify and give
ourself the label that truly defines us
through integration I like you say who
envy list is all Heinrich thank you
[Applause]
