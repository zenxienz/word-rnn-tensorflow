hope is homeless hope is something that
happens when you aren&#39;t expecting it and
homelessness is something we walk into
we walk by every single day and until it
happens to you you just keep walking and
you pretend it doesn&#39;t exist when that
person sitting on the ground and it&#39;s
you and you watch other people walk by
you think you&#39;re invisible but the
reality is you&#39;re not invisible society
is blind I was homeless I was homeless
for about a year and a half something
that I never thought would happen to me
homelessness is many things it&#39;s not
just sleeping in the street and it&#39;s not
just it just doesn&#39;t happen to people
that have mental illness issues or
someone with drug habits I was making
3000 euros a month but I was not able to
pay for debt six months before that I
was basically we had just raised three
hundred thousand euros for a startup
called Heath accion I was really excited
to get things going and my first my
first son was born to what was supposed
to be the highest moment in my life
became my lowest moment and I really
didn&#39;t know what to do
hope is what&#39;s left when you lose your
mind with that losing track of time one
of the closest indicators for
understanding if a homeless person is
ready to come back into society is
whether or not they can conceive that
what time is for example if they have to
do a presentation for five minutes
normally will happen twenty fifteen
minutes maybe even 30 seconds-1 you to
keep track of time
it means you understand what&#39;s going on
I made a personal decision to become
homeless
the economic situation did not allow me
to have a healthy family lifestyle and I
thought the best thing that I could do
would be to leave that&#39;s probably the
hardest thing I ever had to do I took my
left step out and my first step towards
homelessness without even being able to
understand what that meant the worst
moment in which I felt really hopeless
was when I woke up on the first night
and I heard my son crying in another
room but he wasn&#39;t there and I wasn&#39;t
there for him
that was probably the hardest moment for
me so during a year I was making 3,000
euros pretending like my life was
perfect I had to be with my clients and
pretend like everything was perfect and
that was probably the most difficult
time
hope is an unexpected hand from a
stranger I was actually looking for ways
to get out of my situation and there was
one moment in which I had looked at
Cuddy tha&#39;s there was one problem I was

working from 7:00 in the morning until

1:00 o&#39;clock at night and you have to be

there at 8:00 o&#39;clock that is impossible
for me I couldn&#39;t stop working to be

there at 8:00 o&#39;clock and ironically I
went to lunch week and I spent that
night underneath the Stars with my
future partner and it&#39;s ironic because
that would have been where I was going
to be sleeping
the next night but she opened up a door
for me she gave me a place to live home
is not just a roof home is a place where
you feel comfortable and secure and you
can focus on what&#39;s really important to
you
once you helped yourself you can help
others I was not able to help anyone
else but I was able to focus on a model
to help someone else I&#39;m the first
homeless entrepreneur I&#39;m the first
success story in that sense because I
was figuring out how do I get out of
this situation
I had 35,000 contacts online I had my
entrepreneurial spirit in mid design and
my desire to change my situation I
focused on that and focused on it and
focused on it and when I was out because
I had a home a place to call home I then
started working with the first homeless
entrepreneur publicly Marko&#39;s I had just
got done offering English classes for
free to Pablo Iglesias and that was
unless sexta my friends recorded it and
I said okay let&#39;s go edit it so we can
send it out I was walking through Metro
niversity debt and Marcos was sitting on
the ground like this and he was asking
for a friendly coin I walked by I
thought I have an event in two days to
raise funds for the first homeless
entrepreneur and there are no homeless
entrepreneurs yet because strangely
enough the entities that should help you
the most give you responses like if you
can&#39;t offer housing for life we can&#39;t
help you
or if you can&#39;t promise they&#39;ll they&#39;ll
never go back to the street we can&#39;t
help you these are things that I could
not promise anyone but I kept looking
and I ran into Marcos probably the most
complicated person I could work with but
I like challenges so I came and I sat
down by his side something that people
don&#39;t normally do and I said Marcos do
you mind if I record you with a big
camera give you gifts for Christmas and
share that with the world
he was like free presents I&#39;m like yeah
okay so we did the first video and that
was my first step in trying to help
someone besides myself
hope is failing and succeeding while
always proceeding everyone talks about
success kind of makes me laugh if you
want a success story that everyone
smiles about and can read the newspaper
Paco is an example he was homeless for
three years and he was unemployed for
three years I was in Haiti working with
the IDP the inter-american Development
Bank and I received a message on
LinkedIn saying we&#39;re looking for a
programmer I said I have the person for
you his name is Paco I sent a message to
Paco I said Paco you have an interview
he went running to the interview he got
the job not me
we got the interview but he got the job
thanks to that he&#39;s now making 1300
euros a month and he donates 10% of what
he makes to the association so we can
help with his rap CD which is his talent
because we believe talent can change
your life and he&#39;s also gonna be a
father in seven months that&#39;s an example
of a success story for me personally
working with them every single step
forward is success what we try to do is
make sure that the step backwards isn&#39;t
as far as last time and reduce the
margin of error but this is the most
important thing helping them smile more
and longer that&#39;s our most important
indicator
help is growing unfortunately at 35
years I can&#39;t grow anymore my
four-year-old son can and also so can
our association
what word we&#39;re doing now is we&#39;re
reaching we&#39;re helping 12 people in
Barcelona
Tarragona Rios Madrid Santiago and even
Islamabad in Pakistan but we want to do
it the right way it&#39;s not about being in
the press being in the press is really
easy you just have to give people a
story that want to hear the journalists
don&#39;t even check to know if it&#39;s true
it&#39;s easy but that&#39;s not our goal when
we enter a city we start with one or two
people and we make sure that they get
what they need they have one coordinator
and nine managers do you know how many
people it actually takes to help one
person get off the street in six to
twelve months thirty thirty people
dedicate him one hour a week to a
stranger that they don&#39;t know and to
that homeless person who doesn&#39;t
necessarily have to trust them and the
result is that there have been four
people that have gotten out of the
street because of what we&#39;re doing some
people have the opportunity thanks to
government pay checks but the majority
is employment homeless entrepreneur is a
homeless person who wants to tell their
story which creates transparency and
credibility which brings people together
and work hard to get off the street the
majority like outside and normal society
will be employees but the
intrapreneurial spirit and mindset
allows them to be motivated and smile
which gets people involved and that&#39;s
the main difference
it&#39;s not about just putting a roof over
their head it&#39;s not what it&#39;s about is
giving them an opportunity to be active
citizens turning liabilities into assets
turning donations into deposits when you
put a donation in you&#39;re never going to
see anything back but if you make it a
deposit and they return even twenty five
percent you&#39;re creating 25 percent more
wealth so you can help more people
hope is having a solid foundation in
more than one sense a foundation like an
NGO or foundation as a place to stay you
have models like housing first which
really help people get back into a house
so they can focus again but we believe
that homeless entrepreneur is essential
to make sure that housing first really
takes place 35% of the people that are
homeless are there because they lost
their job and what we are going to be
doing in the near future is the
Association will be there for the 40,000
homeless people in Spain so they have a
place where they can speak and a place
where people listen to them and working
on building the foundation as well so
that way we can raise the 30,000 euros
that&#39;s needed so that way we can deal
with institutions in a more professional
way hope is working if they&#39;re not
willing to sweat we won&#39;t sweat either
working is what gives them the
opportunity to be active citizens tomas
one of the homeless entrepreneurs right
now he doesn&#39;t have to work anymore he
got a government paycheck so he&#39;ll be
making 1,100 a month he&#39;s 57 years old
he has no need to work with us but he
receives value as friends and family and
he&#39;s forms part of our community which
adds value to his life he is now working
as a full-time volunteer to recruit
future homeless entrepreneurs and
transfer the knowledge that he has
received in his experience to help other
people get involved in society again
hope is Tomas unfortunately he wasn&#39;t
able to come today because he couldn&#39;t
pay for the train ticket but on the 25th
he&#39;s going to be able to do something
more important that he&#39;s going to be
able to pay for a place to stay
Timaeus is widowed but he can still
smile and by the end of the month he&#39;s
going to be smiling with a full set of
teeth thanks to a place called dental
residency instead of having to pay 3,000
euros for a budget for his teeth because
he was missing a lot of them we brought
it down to 1310 and 605 now he&#39;s going
to be able to smile and he&#39;s going to be
able to show people how he really feels
hope is that good-looking guy over there
from Brazil Beto
he came to Spain looking for change and
he didn&#39;t have any change in his pocket
he ended up in Park me at all which is
next to plus espana for a few days his
entrepreneurial spirit helped him sell
tissues so he could buy a 500 euro
camera how long would that take a normal
person he was able to do it in less than
a month because people gave him five ten
even fifty euros because they weren&#39;t
buying the Kleenex that were buying his
hope his desire his will to get off of
the street and this is what gives me
chills and this is what I hope gives you
chills and moves you to action Beto
what does hope mean to you hope he is
doing what I love samaya
last but not least for us hope is
homeless entrepreneur thank you very
much
