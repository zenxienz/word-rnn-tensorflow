what if we don&#39;t have a political
problem what if we don&#39;t have a
Hollywood problem what if we don&#39;t have
an opioid problem what if I presented
these issues to you in a different way
the electorate and the elected are a
reflection of those who go to the polls
Hollywood is a reflection of the
audience it serves and opioids are a
numbing agent for a much deeper
individual need what if we spent so much
time reacting to all of the noise around
us that we miss the fundamental problem
if I accept these propositions and the
general rule that they communicate which
is that our social ills are a reflection
of the condition of our society then I
have to take some time to think about
how our society got to where it is now
and this process
logically begins at the beginning where
society is stitched together and this
part of the process is especially
important to me because my day job
involves stitching together one of the
most fundamental aspects of society it&#39;s
to where I build my bridges and that is
to the family in other words my day job
is making babies but the last weird way
to say that is I work in the field of
in-vitro fertilization right you have to
make things always a little bit awkward
at the dinner table
I&#39;m very proud of this picture this is
our embryo hall-of-fame picture those
are human embryos superimposed against
the finest salt crystals you can find
and for an embryo to qualify to be on
this picture it had to have become a
human baby so each one of those guys are
alive and some some of them are in their
early teens now my goal from a 3,000
foot perspective today is to get you to
think very deeply about what happens
when technology doesn&#39;t just change how
we live but can begin to fundamentally
change who we are and the reason we&#39;re
going to spend the rest of our time
together here laser focusing in on IVF
and technology is that technology that
can begin to affect how a human is built
serves as a testbed for our assumptions
and preconceptions that inform our
worldview and inform the way we live and
the way our society looks at large so I
want you to sit back and relax as we go
into this very specific field of IVF
technology and ethics and I want to
begin by telling you a story it&#39;s a
beautiful spring morning the lilacs are
out and you&#39;re feeling a trip to the zoo
today so you&#39;re calling to work well
tell your boss I&#39;m sick and you know he
doesn&#39;t buy it but doesn&#39;t matter you
can&#39;t do anything about it
you go to the zoo and you don&#39;t care
much for zoos not really but you&#39;re
going to the gorilla habitat and this
part of the zoo is special to you you
walk over and you look down and you see
a gorilla named Agatha
now while Agatha may look like all of
the other gorillas in her pen she&#39;s not
just another gorilla not to you at least
you see gorillas Agatha is your birth
mother every element of your appearance
your blue eyes your dark hair was
designed by an embryologist in the lab
using sperm from an anonymous donor
eggs from an anonymous donor and they
selected and designed the embryo to
specification using an embryo D
selection process and once your parents
realize that renting an animal womb is
much less expensive than the human
alternative the embryologist transferred
your embryo into the womb of Agatha nine
months later out you come fully human
perfectly healthy and with no biological
connection to your parent who&#39;s going to
raise you what so ever you think what
I&#39;m talking about is impossible it&#39;s not
embryologists today using embryo
selection technology you can
fundamentally and basically design a
human and once our society becomes
comfortable with the idea it is entirely
possible for a gorilla to carry a human
baby to term if you still don&#39;t believe
me look it up you&#39;ve got phones I&#39;ve
even put the search term up there for
you inner cell mass transfer this is a
technique that was perfected in animals
in the early 1990s we live in a world
where the evolution of technology has
begun to delimit the boundaries of what
we are able to do and we as humans love
this imagery we love the idea that lines
are erased that not even the sky is the
limit it holds a certain kind of luster
that we just find enticing we do things
because we can and this mindset is
something that has been pervasive
throughout our Western society really
since the Renaissance I call it a canned
culture we do things because we can but
the yin to this concepts yang is the
idea of odd odd implies that our society
and our behavior should be ordered in a
particular way not in order imply that
there are limits to what we can do it
also implies that if things aren&#39;t
ordered the way they ought to be ordered
we can expect to see some negative
repercussions down the line
and implies also that limits are there
for the sake of that we wish to protect
cherish and promote now I want you to
keep these two concepts in mind as I
tell you another story I was talking
with the embryologist who&#39;s from out of
state and he was telling me about a case
that he was involved in started when a
couple walked into the IVF Center and
they said we want his child with the
specific genotype and with a specific
phenotype well I mean most IVF labs have
this technology it&#39;s commonplace now we
have it why not use it to serve the
customers need they designed the embryo
using donor eggs no no sperm and once
this embryo had been selected for the
specifications that the parents wanted
the parents decided that they didn&#39;t
really want to go through the
inconvenience of carrying the child to
term so they retained the services of a
commercial gestational carrier it&#39;s a
large industry throughout the world six
months into the pregnancy the attending
obstetrician discovered that this child
has a heart defect and it would require
corrective open-heart surgery to correct
shortly after birth this wasn&#39;t the
product that the parents had ordered
this isn&#39;t what they signed up for the
child wasn&#39;t really even there&#39;s not
there&#39;s junetta clay and it hadn&#39;t been
born yet really all this presented was a
very expensive failed investment so they
embedded the child in utero the
gestational carrier despite the parents
decided to carry this child to term and
said she would raise the child on the
appointed day she brought the child for
the open-heart surgery but while the
child was recovering in the intensive
care unit she realized that there are
long-term repercussions to her decisions
and this is in what she&#39;s signed up for
either she too abandoned the child as I
started wrestling with the concepts of
can and ought in my own work and dealing
with messy situations like this one I
came to the realization
that we can use extreme and powerful
technology that is the same but the
philosophies and the assumptions that
lead into it and its application can be
as different as night and day let me
give you an example of what I mean a
couple comes to an infertility clinic
they meet with the doctor and they&#39;re
suffering from miscarriage after
miscarriage after miscarriage well going
to the extremes of what we are capable
of on a technological level we can use a
procedure that&#39;s been used throughout
all of these examples that I&#39;ve
mentioned pre-implementation genetic
screening and we can determine that this
couple is suffering from a rare genetic
disease that is embedded in the embryos
the majority of their embryos have it
some don&#39;t and this disease causes
spontaneous abortions at three weeks of
gestational age now using this
technology we can go in and transfer one
of the few embryos that don&#39;t have this
genetic disease as a result this couple
can have a child and this genetic
disease that has been plaguing this
family online can be eradicated for
generations to come
you see there&#39;s this misnomer that the
concept of odd is prudent that if you
subscribe to the idea of limits that
that will steer you away from
advancement and progress now as we&#39;re
wrestling through these examples
together let me assure you that that is
a false dichotomy you can be a very
aggressive in your science but very
thoughtful in how you apply it let me
tell you one final story a couple of
parents this time come into an
infertility clinic and they bring their
four-year-old daughter with it turns out
as we&#39;re having this conversation that
their daughter has bone marrow cancer
and if she doesn&#39;t receive a bone marrow
transplant from an exact donor
genetic match she will be dead within
two years can you imagine what this
family must be going through their only
child their first child dying as they
watch
but there&#39;s a treatment for this
theoretically we can use what&#39;s called
HLA typing selection to create a number
of embryos and an embryologist can go in
there with the wisp of a needle no
larger than a fraction of the width of
your hair and a blast from a laser
scalpel this embryo can be selected and
this embryo can be transferred over into
the mom this mom can carry this child to
term and the birth of the baby boy
can lead to the ability to potentially
save the life of the older sibling with
a bone-marrow transplant that can happen
just a few months after birth the
younger life gave sustenance to the
older life both children can live can
this procedure be performed yes of
course it can technology&#39;s there it&#39;s
easy at this procedure to be performed
are we to create new human life for the
purpose of another does it set a
dangerous precedent of creating human
life for functionally the ability to
have spare parts is this a road we ought
to go down and the time that I&#39;ve been
around in the industry our embryologists
have encountered iterations of this case
twice and I&#39;m not going to tell you what
we did in those cases because that would
defeat the purpose of why I&#39;m here today
I want you to work through this for
yourself but as we&#39;re taking a step back
now and moving out of the world of
infertility technology and going back to
the bigger picture that we were talking
about earlier I do want to leave you
with two questions just to help you get
started on the thinking process question
number one might be an obvious one are
you a can person or are you a not person
and depending on your answer to this
question I suggest you ask yourself a
follow-up for the can people if you&#39;re a
can person have you considered the
consequences of your ideas are you ready
to live in a delimited
and all that it entails many people
absolutely pick this option so you&#39;re
not in the minority if you&#39;re out there
question for the OP people if you are an
odd person are you clear on what informs
your concept of what ought is and let me
just kind of bat down a notion right out
of the gate
OTT cannot be informed by unique
individual conviction because if odd is
informed by unique individual conviction
then we&#39;ve masterfully gone full circle
and we live in a can society if people
determine for themselves what is on an
individual basis then that is
fundamentally what a delimited society
is right and wrong determined at will so
if you decide that you are an odd person
you need to be very clear and have
something more transcendental than just
individual human women I hope you see
why I believe this discussion is so
valuable
you see talking about IVF biotechnology
and technology that can begin to affect
human life teases out this fundamental
question of can and odd and by thinking
through this we discover what our
assumptions and preconceptions are that
inform how we live our lives and what
our society looks like on the aggregate
you&#39;ll remember at the beginning I asked
a series of three questions and these
questions hinge on the idea that the
things we see on our news feed in the
morning when we&#39;re trying to get out of
bed and that make us one of facepalm
right back into the pillow might
actually be a reflection of who we are
and if we don&#39;t like what we see in the
mirror do we need to ask ourselves the
question if perhaps our society and dare
I say our individual lives are not
ordered the way they ought to be and if
I come to this conclusion does that
change how I deal with the problems I
find on my own street corner
I want you to think about this deeply
because ideas have consequences and like
in the field of infertility in IVF some
of those consequences can extend to
life-and-death situations and I promise
you you do not want to be thinking about
this for the first time when you&#39;re in
the hot seat so think about it deeply
think about it deeply now I promise you
it&#39;ll be worth your effort and remember
Agatha is always right around the corner
thank you so much
[Applause]
