decisions and choices and what we make
and what we come across all the time I&#39;m
sure all of us have had to make some
really tough calls during the course of
our lives but the sort of decisions I&#39;m
going to talk about today are the ones
that became a defining line between life
and death
choices that led to sacrifice that
altered the course of my destiny forever
my name is saad mohammed and almost six
months ago
I made a decision to give up the only
chance I&#39;ll probably ever have of
climbing Mount Everest I was born in
Karachi but although I lived most of my
life in Islamabad but like a true
Karachi aight i just simply love that a
loo in my Brioni or a grab my circus you
go alone a heap a son to marry played
Hazara pleases me rocked EG my car so
despite having been born at sea level
i had a dream a dream to climb the
tallest mountain on the planet and if i
had been successful i would have
literally gone from zero to the top of
the world so much before everest in 2012
i was part of a Pakistani Chinese
expedition which successfully made it to
the summit of Sputnik span thick is a
7,000 meter peak in the Karakoram range
near Skardu it&#39;s a lovely majestic peak
and on our way back from the summit we
got stuck in a snowstorm and we lost our
way it was a total complete whiteout and
we ended up spending a night outside and
temperatures ranging between minus 30 to
minus 40 degree centigrades
a day altitude of 6300 meters above sea
level without any shelter - just to give
you a feel of what 6300 meters
above sea level would be Madonna
qionghua guardians McCoy as a shock so
Josh tuck marina Higa quasar coha tune
up nigga
embarrass about me when I talk so other
than that gentlemen it makes it much
easier for me to explain it to you that
if you look here we&#39;ve got Murray down
there that Browns small triangle there
and when you compare it with span thick
as a giant when standing next to it and
then you&#39;ve got k2 and you got Everest
so I got her Mariko Takahashi on thick
coat hawk and Marika sadly I was Quixote
technically miracle laughs you couldn&#39;t
share that cardigan but yes you see 6300
meters is up there and we were stuck up
there and when we were stuck up there at
6300 meters it was cold
beaver all madly fatigued tired to the
bone
we were hungry we were thirsty but all I
wanted to do was to sleep because they
can I love Allah Karim our expedition
leader car retired colonel abdul-jabbar
but Issa was also my mentor he realized
that if we were to survive a night
outside against all these odds then we
would have to make our own shelter
thus the snow caves so the bar party
must have been calling out my name for
quite some time because when he hit me
on the head to wake me up there was a
sense of urgency in his voice he said
heart like nothing happened
he&#39;s like you need to keep digging okay
all the while I remember he&#39;s working on
his cave and he&#39;s using the pace of his
ice axe and he&#39;s digging and digging
ever so slowly ever so meticulously as
if that&#39;s the only thing he ever wanted
to do I on the other hand was doing
whatever little I could and I must have
dozed off the thing is he kept calling
my name
every time I dozed off the reason being
that if I had slept outside in the open
in those conditions I could easily have
frozen to death
and so when he
was done perfecting his cave he woke me
up one last time and he says okay come
and get in and the last thing I remember
before dozing off again is that he&#39;s
sitting on the mouth of the cave and
he&#39;s holding this sheet of flimsy
emergency blanket and to cover the the
opening just to make my chances of
survival better I can simply not forget
or ever repay that item a gesture of
kindness of selflessness of empathy so
yes we survived and we got down
eventually that&#39;s another story in
itself but the lesson here is not about
survival against all odds the lesson
here is that the expedition leader had
the vision had the foresight to realize
that our lives were in danger and if if
it were not for his compassion is
empathy his kindness his selflessness I
would not be here today talking about
our survival about our ordeal so five
years down the road we were together
again ing our party and this time on
Mount Everest and in some ways I was
able to reciprocate what he did for me
on spanic and he got to the summit while
I was still shuttling in between camp to
and cam three just to give you a field
camp - is at 6500 metres above sea level
and cam 3 is more than 7,000 metres
above sea level so I was really mad
izing and he had made it to the summit
but on his way back he had an accident
and he had to be rescued and six months
on almost five months on after returning
from the expedition he&#39;s still
recovering his hands have severe
frostbite and so is the Sherpa and I
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible or if it
will need a miracle but I hope and I
pray that may they both recover from
their ordeals soon enough you see
mountaineering is a very
strange sport it&#39;s very hard to get
sponsorships when you can&#39;t guarantee a
summit there are too many variables
involved you&#39;re fit you&#39;re skilled
you&#39;ve got the best equipment you&#39;re
climatized and the weather goes bad even
if the weather holds your Sherpa your
high altitude Porter might get sick
might back out this is very little you
can do in such a situation
so as an old mountaineering friend once
told me when you approach a mountain you
stay humble and you seek its permission
if you have to so that it may let you
climb that is the only way a pka okay
she bought me a spoon Rachel crane no
Saipan ski no Creek race okay OC papaya
Kappa openeth errata and yes people do
ask me that time and again why is that
that I keep going back to these
mountains there&#39;s no straight answer to
that it is hardly explainable in words
but once in shrim shawl back in 2010 I
was coming down from the chechen massive
after a failed summit attempt and
there&#39;s this Terrace at 5,000 meters
above sea level and right after that
Terrace there is a steep decline and in
front of me are lined up in a beautiful
Vista these lesser-known karakorum Peaks
all 7,000 ders kuhnian chashmah
marrakech souk Shingleton
that&#39;s the hills are one of them is just
a hundred and 25 meters short of being
an eight-thousander these are massive
rocket beautiful mountains that send
chills down your spine and I think out
my camera and I&#39;m doing this short clip
and I&#39;m doing a commentary and I say no
much except uchiha in Pajaro me in be

chamber below me in chat anomie llaman
sarmento nerve on Malta spoon milk
you cannot find that Nirvana that
solitude anywhere else not even in
meditation I dare say and when there
when you&#39;re up alone in that moment
nothing else matters over there you&#39;re
surrounded by peaks and you are as close
as one can possibly be to your true
creator yes coming back to Everest when
I got news of Jabbar Bertie going
missing after summit I was at Camp two
and I was about to leave for the summit
myself so I called my Sherpa and I tell
him okay pack up we&#39;re leaving for camp
three and he tells me that I have a
message from the base camp so I&#39;m not
entirely sure if it was the Sherpas who
were freaking out of her if it was the
base camp
that was going through a crisis because
of the party incident but he wanted me
to come down and it made no sense at all
because going down meant that I would
have to rest another three four days
before making another summit push and
with the season coming to an end in the
next nine ten days it would have been
too risky for a climber like me so I had
very little choice and I decided okay
I&#39;ll have another go at the summit only
after seeing the condition of mr. party
so I arrived at the base camp and the
very next day
Jabar Bertie was Harry rescued and he
arrived at the base camp and the whole
saga unfolded in front of me he was so
big and so disturbed and I had to make
the toughest decision of my life do I
give up my dreams or do I still go for
the summit I just could not leave him in
that condition I&#39;m not a paramedic
although I do have some hands-on
experience but when we arrived in
Kathmandu I did not rush back home
because Japan but he needed me I did not
have to give up my summit bit but I did
I could have easily gone up to camp four
that is 8,000 meters that would have
been a landmark move for me but I let it
go
why you ask me because Jabbar but he is
a friend and that&#39;s what friends do for
each other so we arrived back in Buxton
and the trekkers community in general
they gave us an awesome reception and
the amount of love and respect they&#39;ve
given me just for my attempt is simply
phenomenal but coming away - Oh sniffing
much Bordertown Jaeger Mavic aho teach
our Jetta the yellow mirror South
Jakarta
so anyway maybe soon enough
perhaps I&#39;ll again be in Katmandu or
namche bazaar or kala patthar or better
yet at kam fold heading out for the
summit to achieve what I had set out to
do once before so wish me luck and Alana
