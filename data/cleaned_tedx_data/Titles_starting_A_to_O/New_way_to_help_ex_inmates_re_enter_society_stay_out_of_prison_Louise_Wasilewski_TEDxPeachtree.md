you&#39;ve heard about mass incarceration
how the war on drugs and mandatory
minimums has contributed to the u.s.
incarcerated 500% as many people as the
rest of the world today we&#39;re going to
look at a related issue what happens
when all those people are released from
prison ninety five percent pretty much
everyone in prison will be released they
will have paid their debt and they&#39;re
coming back our criminal justice system
should be a system of rehabilitation so
if it&#39;s doing its job you would expect
that people who get out get jobs and
stay out but in fact two-thirds of
people re-incarcerated within three
years it&#39;s an expensive problem if
somebody has served a typical three year
sentence that means you and I as
taxpayers have invested $100,000 in
their rehabilitation but here&#39;s what
blew me away one in five people walking
into prison are going in for breaking
the extra rules of probation and parole
for doing things that if you or I did
them wouldn&#39;t be an offense to be clear
these people have not been convicted of
a new offense technical violations are
things like missing a court date a
parole or therapy appointment not having
a stable job or housing not paying fines
in fact I know of multiple cases where
people have been picked up because they
were in hospital when they should have
met their parole officer speaking of
hospitals let&#39;s compare our criminal
just this rehabilitation system to
another rehabilitation system we&#39;re all
familiar with healthcare this might not
be an obvious comparison but bear with
me for a moment
when my grandfather was released from
hospital after his hip replacement he
received medication exercises had
physiotherapy appointments each week
regular visit with his physician
somebody in the assisted living facility
cleaned his wound
there was this comprehensive plan to
make sure that the time and money
invested in his surgery wasn&#39;t wasted
let&#39;s compare that to when someone gets
out of prison
imagine Michael young man picked up for
a burglary and found with oxycontin in
his pocket he serves his three years and
then he&#39;s released with 25 bucks a bus
ticket and the clothes he stood up in
that&#39;s it the first thing Michael did
was buy his first ice-cold coca-cola in
three years and that tasted pretty darn
good and peanuts that had the taste of
freedom roasted right into them he took
the bus and when he got off in Times
Square so he didn&#39;t know what to do
surrounded by the hustle and bustle and
the noise and the crowds I mean like
where do you start he was overwhelmed
all he knew was he had to find a place
to sleep and to get to his first parole
appointment in a couple of days there is
no comparison is there as I&#39;ve traveled
around the country listening to people
who have got out this word overwhelmed
comes up over and over again you see
Michael had been institutionalized
almost every decision and every hour of
his day had been managed for him and
suddenly in this very fragile state of
transition he had a whole bunch of big
important decisions to make and 24
extra hours a day to manage but his
decision-making muscle atrophy he just
didn&#39;t know where to start as a
condition of parole Michael had to go to
a substance abuse group see a counselor
he needed help from a housing counselor
to help him find a place to live he
needed help from a workforce counselor
to find an employer willing to hire
someone with a felony conviction and of
course he had to go see his parole
officer and show up with all the
paperwork to prove he&#39;d been doing the
things he was supposed to do if he
didn&#39;t satisfy those conditions then his
parole officer can halt him before a
judge who can revoke his parole and send
him back to prison
that is why one in five people walk into
prison technical violations imagine you
have a massive project and the project
manager has no tools and he is the least
organized person on the team it doesn&#39;t
matter how hard everybody else is
working that project is not going to be
a success that role of project manager
is the role we have put Michael in let
me show you what happens when the
housing counselor and the workforce
counselor don&#39;t talk because of privacy
rules they get Michael a place to live
on one side of town and a job on the
other side of town working the breakfast
shift the trouble is
transit isn&#39;t that reliable really early
in the morning so the second time
Michael was late he lost his job which
meant he couldn&#39;t afford to pay his
counselor nor could he pay his rent so
that pushed him back into homelessness
and needing all those services all over
again and of course when he told his
parole officer that he&#39;d lost his job
well then she was really interested
and Michael well Michael was overwhelmed
it doesn&#39;t have to be like that in
health care there is an approach called
patient mediated exchange that allows a
person to get their own information and
once they have it they can give it to
somebody else including another
professional like a healthcare worker
and it&#39;s called patient mediated
exchange in the healthcare world and in
the criminal-justice world they didn&#39;t
have a name because it wasn&#39;t being done
so we decided to change that and I want
to show you what happens when everybody
can work together Michael can answer
some simple questions to help him find
the services that he needs and get
connected with a service provider in his
community even before he is released
from prison so he knows what to do as
soon as he gets out on that first day he
can build a plan and his workforce and
housing counselors substance abuse can
all contribute to that same plan that he
can share back with his parole officer
Michael can access this on his own smart
phone he&#39;s in control and so his he goes
to each of his appointments he can for
example take a photograph of a job
application and upload that just like
you and I would take a photograph of a
receipt and submit it to our expense
reports he can actually physically check
in at a location to demonstrate he did
go to that job interview there is a
calendar and that means that all the
different caseworkers know where Michael
is supposed to be and when so they don&#39;t
share your things on top of each other
it means Michael knows when he&#39;s
supposed to be in court solving the
problem of the notice being mailed to
some previous address who knows where
and with a messaging function that
allows everybody to talk together about
Michael&#39;s case with Michael in the
middle of the conversation it is much
easier to respond to unexpected
situations
so maybe workforce and housing can now
get Michael a job and a house on the
same side of town and maybe just maybe
the relationship between Michael and his
officer will get better with better
communication to be clear we know that
coordinated case management with
sanctions for screwing up actually works
works in terms of reducing recidivism
and works in terms of reducing costs
the Washington State Institute for
Public Policy looked at this sort of
situation and they found looking at
savings to taxpayers and to the
participant these programs save about
fifteen thousand dollars per person and
what we found is the app also looks like
it works for the individuals themselves
so here are some early results from jail
reentry program that we&#39;re working on
here in Georgia I felt for the first
time that there were people who would
really help me I used a calendar so I
actually knew what I was supposed to do
I got a promotion so now I can save up
for a car I wasn&#39;t so overwhelmed and
knew what to do the technology is simply
a way for the person to access the
resources that are already in the
community but it makes it possible to
manage reentry it puts everyone on the
same page and it gives the individual
beginning of a sense of control let&#39;s go
back to the medical field for a moment
health care has been
adopting patient-centered technology for
quite a while now there are dozens of
apps for diabetes that put the doctor
and the patient on the same page they
guide the patient so that they aren&#39;t so
overwhelmed in managing their condition
and they allow for better more timely
interventions which leads to better
outcomes why would this kind of thing
not work for people who have even more
things to manage and much higher
consequences of failure I don&#39;t want to
imply that technology is the whole
answer here there is no easy button for
re-entry and nothing will replace the
face-to-face interactions that help
somebody like Michael transition from
institutionalized thinking to
independent thinking but if we are able
to share information in a way that
respects Michael&#39;s privacy we ought to
be able to see those same improved
interventions and improved outcomes that
we see in healthcare what I&#39;m talking
about here is self-sufficiency and we
speak about self-sufficiency as though
it is about having enough money to live
on
but self-sufficiency is also about
making good decisions about
self-management it is about making case
management change from being something
done to a person to something done with
and by them this is an incredibly
expensive problem it costs about 60
dollars a day to keep somebody in prison
and if you add that up for all the
people on technical violations in even a
subset of states it is a billion dollar
plus problem this really is worth
working on what I&#39;m talking about is
giving people like Michael a fighting
chance to make it on the outside
which benefits them and their families
it also helps parole officers who do an
incredibly difficult job with heavy
caseloads and very little recognition of
course it also helps us as taxpayers and
as people living in the community thank
you very much
