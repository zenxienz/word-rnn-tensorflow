what do you do when life gives you
lemons you freeze them and then throw
them at people who are annoying you no
I&#39;m just kidding we don&#39;t throw lemons
at people but what we can do is squeeze
them into water and make lemon water and
then drink it
which alkalizes our body which changes
everything it really does when we
alkalis our body it completely
transforms our entire life it not only
makes us feel a hundred times better but
it also changes our mental state and the
environment for the better now take a
moment right now and just get present in
your body take a breath and just wiggle
your toes
and just notice if you have any
heaviness in the body or if you feel any
pain any discomfort any tiredness and
now what if I told you that if you
alkalize your body all your health
problems could go away you&#39;ll have so
much more energy your skin will blur
your sleep so much better you&#39;ll feel
more positive you&#39;ll shed excess weight
and you can even heal disease including
cancer and the best part is anybody can
do it anybody can alka lies their body
today and keep it that way
for the rest of their life I discovered
this miracle elixir nine years ago and I
applied it to my life I&#39;m really 65
years old Oh guys I&#39;m just kidding
but you are looking at the after because
the before was a whole of a story so I
used to be one of those people who
thought salads were the most boring
thing ever and I used to live off junk
food for breakfast lunch and dinner
until I ended up rock bottom with my
health and I landed in hospital when I
was just 21 because I had a lump the
size of a golf ball right here
bulging out of my neck so I was in the
hospital and the doctor doctor took a
needle and pulled a piece of it out and
sent it away for a biopsy and I remember
looking around the hospital thinking
what have I done to myself and I knew
that I had done it to myself because of
my poor lifestyle choices so a week
later the results came back and I was
diagnosed with stage one cancer in the
form of this tumor in my lymphatic
system which is the body&#39;s surge system
so obviously I had overloaded my body on
way too much pollution that it was like
you can&#39;t do this anymore I also had
epstein-barr virus chronic fatigue my
blood work showed I was on the verge of
leukemia my immune system was so low and
my skin was slightly yellow because my
liver was not processing properly my
digestive system was not functioning
correctly and you can see from this live
blood test I had done that I was riddled
with parasites they were basically
invading my blood and this is a sign of
a very unhealthy person which was me but
I actually started out really healthy in
life thanks mom and I grew up mostly
here in Alice Springs which is right in
the center of Australia in the outback
and my town had a very rich Aboriginal
influence so from a young age I learned
from the indigenous people about the
land and their diet and almost
everything they ate was alive a
nutrient-rich and guess what the cancer
rate was for Aboriginal people zero
percent and then there was my
grandfather who sadly passed away of
cancer when I was 12 years old which was
very devastating to entire family and
unfortunately he ate far too much
processed foods and I remember as a
child comparing his diet to the diet of
the indigenous people and that&#39;s when I
realized that those
so much processed foods toxins and
chemicals that we can consume before we
get really sick so I was not surprised
that I was in hospital because for five
years I had basically trashed my body I
grew up very healthy because of my
parents
and we ate very natural simple foods but
then when I was 16 I started to feel
feelings of depression and anxiety
although at the time I didn&#39;t know what
that was I just knew that it felt bad
and to avoid feeling bad I went out and
did what I knew would give me a quick
fix relief and bring my energy levels up
so I did what I knew would do that and
my drug of choice was junk food I call
it junk food because it&#39;s Persis food
that&#39;s basically devoid of all
nutritional value and instead full of
chemicals genetically modified organisms
preservatives additives food dyes
aspartame sugar which weakens our immune
system immediately gluten which takes so
much energy from the body to digest so I
went out and I bought a huge amount of
junk foods and I ate all of it and I
felt so good I was on top of the world
for about ten minutes and then I came
crashing down and I felt really really
bad and I felt guilty about my choice
because I knew it was not doing anything
good to my situation so I told myself
it&#39;s okay I&#39;ll start again tomorrow
tomorrow I&#39;ll be healthy and I&#39;ll never
eat junk foods ever again
so tomorrow came and I woke up and I had
a strong craving for gummy bears that
would not go away so for hours and hours
and then I just gave in and I told
myself it&#39;s okay I&#39;ll just eat junk food
today as much as I want to eat and I&#39;ll
start again tomorrow but unfortunately I
continued this vicious binge eating
cycle every single day for five years
no wonder my digestive system wasn&#39;t
working and no wonder I got so sick so I
was in hospital and I decided I did not
want to do chemo I did not want to do
radiation and I did not want to do
surgery I didn&#39;t just want to cut it out
because I knew that I had to address the
deeper root cause and finally get health
once and for all and because of my
upbringing I had confidence if there was
a better way to cure cancer than cutting
burning and poisoning so I left the
hospital and I set out on a mission to
be healthy and I was going to heal
myself and I was going to stop eating
junk food and I was finally gonna live
the life that I really wanted to live
and I didn&#39;t know how I was gonna do it
but I just knew somehow I was going to
do it and I didn&#39;t get far
until a craving for junk foods hit and
it was a strong impulse for Destruction
and I thought oh here we go again and
that&#39;s the day that I surrendered to the
universe and said I need help I need
something bigger than myself to pull me
out of this once and for all
Here I am 21 I&#39;m so young I&#39;ve been
suffering every single day for five
years being controlled by food I was so
embarrassed that I didn&#39;t tell a single
soul none of my friends knew none of my
family knew I was so embarrassed about
this unhealthy habit and now all I
wanted to do was eat junk food again and
I just could not do it I knew I was like
universe why this doesn&#39;t even make
sense it&#39;s only going to make everything
worse and in this surrendering is when I
received the greatest gift of my life I
had an idea to create a blog and call it
the earth diet and I was going to go
back to my roots go back to nature and
eat foods that came straight from the
earth for 365 days and I was going to
write in it every single day for a year
and the readers were gonna help hold me
accountable so that I wouldn&#39;t go back
to my old habits I started consuming so
much alkalizing rich foods real foods
minerals and I was detoxing out all the
acid from my life so I was creating an
alkaline rich body in which cancer could
not survive so you can guess what
happened right I started to heal and in
three months the tumor in my lymphatic
system was completely
dissolv&#39;d gone and I was cancer free and
I still AM and my whole life changed the
very first day I started this a huge
heavy burden of guilt just lifted off my
shoulders my skin got clearer I shed all
the excess weight that I&#39;d accumulated
from all the purses junk foods and the
best part was that my cravings for junk
food completely went away and I couldn&#39;t
believe it which is half the battle
right if we don&#39;t have those temptations
or those impulses if they go away it&#39;s
so much easier to be healthy and dr.
Otto Warburg was actually the very first
scientist to discover that lower oxygen
is a characteristic for cancer cells so
when the body is acidic it is very low
oxygen and when the body is alkaline
there are sufficient amounts of alcal√°
oxygen and Warburg was actually awarded
with a Nobel Prize for this discovery in
1931 and another study done by Tanis r
Fenton that was published in the u.s.
National Library of Medicine states that
there is evidence that cancer cells grow
well in an acidic environment in a
laboratory and therefore an alkaline
body should be unfriendly to cancer
cells dr. bruce lipton American
biologist states in his own words that
an excess of acidity in the body
produces inflammation in the body which
is the development of many common
illnesses including arthritis there have
been numerous researchers and scientists
and studies and even testimonials of
people healing all types of health
issues including cancer or even just
improving their health by following an
alkaline rich life so now you know my
previous diet was extremely acidic and
now I maintain a very healthy alkaline
body so how do you know if you are
alkaline or acidic well the cool thing
is you can actually test the body&#39;s pH
at any given time so for example if we
were to test your pH right now we could
determine if you
are alkaline or acidic pH stands for the
power of hydrogen so when we measure the
body&#39;s pH we&#39;re measuring its hydrogen
ion concentration you can see that the
scale goes from zero which is extremely
acidic to 14 being extremely alkaline 7
is considered neutral so that&#39;s what we
want to maintain 7 are a little bit
higher for the rest of our life to be
healthy and alkaline okay and I have a
little surprise for y&#39;all right now so
I&#39;ve given you all a little medical
device which has pH testing strips so if
you want to take one out right now and
put that under your tongue for just 15
seconds and within moments we&#39;re going
to know if you are alkaline or acidic
now if you are in the green zone your
alkaline so congratulations you can
enjoy that state that&#39;s where you want
to be if you are acidic don&#39;t beat
yourself up because know this you can
change your body state in an instant so
there are two main things that I did to
alkalize my body that attributed to my
health and healing the first one was
juicing which does include lemon water
the second is replacing acidic junk
foods with alkalizing natural upgrades
and I found that these two things were
the the missing components that I needed
to be healthy in life and what is
holding back millions of people from
truly being healthy because when we&#39;re
nutritionally deprived that&#39;s when we
crave those quick fix things like
processed foods and refined sugars to
bring us back up I started with juicing
so when I was in my healing crisis I
knew that I had to organize my system on
nutrition to make up for the years I had
deprived it so I research ways that I
could get nutrition into my system very
quickly so I learned about the vitamin C
IV injections but I did not like the
sound of needles and then I learned
about juicing vegetables and I got
really excited because when we drink
vegetable juice
we&#39;re drinking the blood of vegetables
and here&#39;s what the blood of vegetables
looks like and this is made up of
chlorophyll it looks extreme
similar to human blood which was made up
of hemoglobin so when we drink vegetable
juice
we&#39;re taking on high doses of vitamins
minerals and nutrients straight into our
cells at a very instant cellular level
so when I was healing I did up to six
juices a day and then when I got healthy
I decided that I would have one fresh
juice every single day for the rest of
my life
and I have successfully done this for
nine years and this is my non-negotiable
this is my daily staple because to me it
just makes total common sense that our
human body needs a certain amount of
nutrition every single day to feel good
and to be energized to help get through
life&#39;s problems and obstacles when they
come up an amazing thing about drinking
juice is that it lifts compacted waste
from the bowel wall so here&#39;s what our
bowel looks like when we&#39;re a babies
it&#39;s clean perfect pristine beautiful
and then here&#39;s what our digestive
system looks like in the middle after
years and years of eating processed
foods and junk foods so it gets stuck to
our bowels and so then when we eat foods
we&#39;re eating all this food but our
digestive system is not absorbing any
nutrition because of this layer of
compacted waste so when we drink juice
and especially if we add beat to it it
lifts off this compacted waste shoots it
out so that the digestive system can do
its job and actually absorb nutrition
from the food and juice is so easily
assimilated into our body so we get
instant energy and instant nutrition and
here&#39;s a really easy green juice recipe
that you guys can remember for the rest
of your life so just think juicy juicy
juicy so start with juicy ingredients
cucumber and celery will give you a lot
of juice and then you can add some more
chlorophyll like parsley kale spinach
and then add some green apple to make it
nice and sweet and then you can add some
lemon and ginger to make it even more
alkalizing so we have a nice green
lemonade the second thing I did to
alkalize my body that completely changed
my world was what I called the upgrade
system so when I started the earth diet
blog as soon
I had a craving I thought how can I have
this craving and fulfill this craving
but in a nourishing way a way that&#39;s
going to give my body a lot of good
vitamins as well as taste really good so
I found a way to have cookie dough
cheesecake even french fries but using a
lot cleaner ingredients so I was cutting
out all of these usual suspects so I
started with making chocolate and I
wanted to start with a chocolate recipe
because chocolate was my number one
biggest obstacle in life it&#39;s what I
craved more than any other food so I set
out to make a recipe using almond flour
cacao powder and maple syrup and then I
would add peanut butter and almond
butter and all of a sudden I had these
delicious chocolate brownies that I
could not believe tasted so good and at
the same time gave me so much
nourishment as well as juicing and the
upgrade system you can also incorporate
alkalizing foods so these are the top
five alkalizing foods on earth so
firstly is lemon or lime so you can
start the day with lemon water and if
you find yourself binge eating on junk
food or feeling heavy just drink a lemon
water it will help to digest that food
out and put you straight back on the
health track two is olive oil three
leafy greens four garlic and five onion
and these are the top five acid forming
substances that we all want to stay away
from so one is sugar including white
sugar raw sugar brown sugar and corn
syrup two is flour three soda four
aspartame and five microwave foods and
in conclusion there are people who
disregard an alkaline diet being helpful
to treat and prevent cancer and it&#39;s
true that not everyone who gets cancer
will make it and there are perhaps many
other reasons why someone will not make
it through cancer but we can know this
we can know that keeping our body and a
healthy alkaline state is obviously a
positive thing and remember that you are
in control of what goes in your mouth
and on your skin no one else controls
that for you and if you only take away
one thing from this talk just go out and
buy a bag of lemons
make lemon water have a juice every
single day and invite all your friends
over I promise it will change your life
thank you
you
