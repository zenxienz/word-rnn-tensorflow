I didn&#39;t dream of being a bridge builder
or a pioneer or a trailblazer I&#39;m a wife
hard-headed sometimes I am a mother a
sister a daughter a friend and sometimes
I&#39;m a cool auntie my professional life I
am a caregiver coaching consultant
I&#39;m a certified senior advisor
gerontologist I am an author I&#39;m author
of the book tears in my gumbo a
caregivers recipe for resilience but of
all the things that I am of all the
things that I have ever been there is
nothing that has impacted my life so
profoundly as that of being a caregiver
before I began the journey I had no clue
that there are only four types of people
in the world those who have been a
caregiver those who are a caregiver
those who will be a caregiver and those
who will need a caregiver which one are
you that question is important because
what you should understand is that we
currently have 44 million people in this
country serving as family caregivers
unpaid I should add and of those 44
million 40 percent are now men so this
is an issue like it or not ready or not
not that will profoundly impact each and
every one of us and the
Sheena&#39;s are we ready are we ready
something else that I want you to know
about me is that I am from New Orleans
born and raised and gumbo is in my DNA
and nobody could prepare gumbo like my
mama my mother had a clear understanding
of the correlation between preparing
gumbo and nurturing the soul and so many
a times we would gather my kitchen my
mother&#39;s kitchen with my aunts and it
would just be a raucous occasion it
would be a fantastic good time going on
but what I didn&#39;t know was that at that
same time they were cultivating a
culture of caring they were sharing
tidbits and life lessons that I couldn&#39;t
possibly know and understand at that
particular time but it was a privilege
and it was a ritual and it was family
and it was wonderful and then one day
the phone rang and we got the news that
my mother had a pituitary brain tumor
and that it was impairing her eyesight
that it was growing at such a rate that
it would eventually take her life if
something wasn&#39;t done now my mother was
quite shocked by that news and she was
paralyzed in a way when it came to
processing and really understand yet and
so my siblings and I clearly understood
that we needed to step up to the plate
and we needed to advocate on behalf of
my mother and admits making decisions on
her behalf so one of the things that we
didn&#39;t know at that time we didn&#39;t
understand what conscious caregiving was
we didn&#39;t know what it was but the
definition of conscious caregiving is
carrying on purpose with intention and a
plan there are five steps
of conscious caregiving that I talk
about in my book but I want to just
explain to you here it&#39;s important to me
that you understand because we&#39;re all in
this particular boat together the first
step of conscious caregiving is what we
experienced immediately upon hearing
that news about a brain tumor
helplessness helplessness we didn&#39;t know
what to do where to turn and it was a
type of inertia that was happening and
going on but one thing about
helplessness is that you don&#39;t get to
stay on that step for very long at all
you are quickly pushed from helplessness
to recognition the recognition that you
don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know there is
so much to learn it&#39;s an entire new
universe it&#39;s like being immersed in a
foreign country today and then another
foreign country where you don&#39;t
understand the language tomorrow
and yet another foreign country the next
day recognition getting comfortable with
the idea that you don&#39;t know and then
you move to the third step which is
process and then process the pieces of
the puzzle slowly start to come together
beings start to make sense and even
though you&#39;re still uncomfortable a
rhythm starts to happen and answers
start to show up and there&#39;s an
understanding that starts to happen
there&#39;s also a whole lot of other things
that happen in process and you may be on
that step for a really really long time
but one of the things that happens in
process is that you understand that h
ELP help is not a dirty word even though
it&#39;s a four-letter word help is
necessary accepting help receiving help
and demand and help
it doesn&#39;t show up in the way in which
you need it in addition what happens in
process is you recognize you had better
make sure that your loved ones affairs
are in order and as you do that you
recognize that your own personal affairs
had better be in order process process
you learn to recognize that this really
is a community effort it requires
oftentimes more than you have the
capacity to give so understand and know
you come to grips with what you can give
and what you can&#39;t and you&#39;re okay with
that after process slowly but surely you
move into acceptance now that doesn&#39;t
mean you like what&#39;s going on or what&#39;s
happening you can&#39;t change the
trajectory of illness or disease but
what you can do is accept acceptance and
then finally surrender happens and that
happens in so many different facets for
my family
surrender happened the day we learned it
was stage 4 breast cancer so not just a
tumor we also had to deal with a stroke
diabetes hepatitis C from multiple blood
transfusions it was one thing after
another after another after another and
then finally stage 4 breast cancer and
when that happened instead of
surrendering I wanted a second opinion
and that&#39;s always important but what I
didn&#39;t realize that that particular time
was my mother had already surrendered
she had had enough
she was ready to let go and after the
news from the second opinion hmm okay I
looked at my mom and she said let&#39;s make
some gumbo and that&#39;s what we did and as
we began cutting and chopping and going
through that lifetime ritual I reminded
my mom that her 71st birthday was just
weeks away and I hesitantly asked her
mom do you want to celebrate my mama
looked at me and said hell yes we kind
of tacked it the YWCA Estes Park
Colorado they have an amazing family
reunion cabin called them and they said
it&#39;s a two-year waiting list three days
later they called back to say there&#39;s
been a cancellation for the exact dates
that you needed it sixty-one of my
family members showed up from all across
the country because that&#39;s how we roll
and we proceeded to have the most
amazing three days celebration of life
that you could ever hope to experience
and it was amazing
showering my mother with love and the
best part of course was that she was
there to hear every single word five
months and six days after returning her
to California per her request she closed
her eyes for the final time there were
no regrets family showed up as family
was supposed to show up I didn&#39;t know at
that time and that&#39;s the 15 year course
of caring for my mother would change my
life so profoundly I would become a
Pathfinder I would become a bridge
builder in this arena of caregiving I
have a mission and a passion to raise
awareness about the impact that
caregiving is having on the people in
our
just this year I lost the cousin at the
age of 58 who had been caring for so
many people in her family but she didn&#39;t
quite take care of herself as well as
she should have as well as we wished she
had so as we talk about this thing
that&#39;s happening this this thing that&#39;s
impacting people and they&#39;re not having
conversations about it they&#39;re not
talking about it I invite you to
participate in the process the first
thing that I&#39;d like you to do is think
about the caregiver in your life what
can you do to support that individual
how can you help out how much of your
time can you give up to make a
difference the second thing that I&#39;d
like you to do is to think about your
aging parents they&#39;ve been competent and
capable all of your lives but as they
age the reality is they will need more
of your help and sometimes they&#39;re gonna
fight you on that I bet be there for
them and then the third thing is think
about your own circumstances who&#39;s going
to look after you put your plans in
writing have a conversation with the
people that you&#39;re interested in that&#39;s
a whole nother TED talk but have a
conversation with the people that mean
the most to you that will carry out your
wishes as you want them to be carried
out in your businesses in your churches
we want to create a culture of caring
curiosity is the name of the campaign I
launched just a year ago and curiosity
is simply about getting back to Kerry
getting back to a state of being where
we simply are kind to each other where
we simply embrace and hug each other
and we&#39;re there and available when we
are needed thank you
