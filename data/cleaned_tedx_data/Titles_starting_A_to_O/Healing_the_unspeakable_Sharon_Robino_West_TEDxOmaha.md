when I was a child books were my friends
Nancy Drew was my hero
such a badass I wanted to be just like
her when I grew up and I wanted to write
so I started at an early age when I was
about 13 my parents divorced and things
got a little bit tough I wanted anything
I had to earn it so when I was in high
school I worked three jobs continued to
write and also got on the high school
yearbook and newspaper it was while I
was on the yearbook that one of our
assignments was to sell ads to help
support the yearbook at Westside so I
came up with a strategy sell it to the
Marines
one of my jobs was up at the mall that
was near the Marine Corps Recruiting
Office and they always came up to our
school to talk to the students so I
thought I would stop by after school one
day and on my way up to work and sell
them so I headed up there one day and as
I came into their office I saw these two
Marines they had on shiny black shoes
and brass buttons that shone like little
lanterns and there was not a wrinkle in
sight I was very impressed by those
uniforms so I started to approach them
and I saw one of the Marines leaned over
to the other one and say I&#39;ll take this
like he was talking to a used-car
manager taking the sale you know and so
he approached me and he said what brings
you here today and I said well I&#39;d like
to talk to you about buying an ad in the
yearbook and he immediately said I&#39;ll
take the largest one sold
and then he said what are you going to
do after high school and I said well I&#39;m
going to be a writer a journalist but
I&#39;m going to see the world first before
I go to school and then he said well did
you know that in the Marine Corps you
can actually write we have a military
occupational specialty or MOS called
public affairs and you can write and get
paid to do it even while you&#39;re on
active duty and go to all these cool
places and well at least that&#39;s how I
heard it so I can do the writing that
I&#39;ve always dreamed of and get paid to
do it and go cool places Wow the Marines
guess who else got sold that day so the
day after he turned 17 the recruiter
came to our house and he had to ask my
mother to sign the enlistment papers
which she did she thought everything I
did was wonderful no questions asked
so in January I graduated early and on
February 20th of that year I packed up
to go to the swamps of Parris Island
South Carolina to boot camp in the only
place that still makes women Marines
today I made it through boot camp but
the only writing that I was able to do
was writing letters home my Marine Corps
recruiter had told me that there was no
guarantee that I would get
public-affairs
so when I got my orders towards the end
of boot camp and I saw the words
communication electronics I was shocked
the school was in Twentynine Palms
California in the middle of a lovely
desert a beach in the middle of the
Mojave I graduated second in my class
after three months of marching in the
Blazing Sun and raking lots of sand the
Marines like lots of nice neat lines in
the sand so I arrived at Camp Lejeune
which was my duty station and I was the
only female in the unit for two years
the Marines in my unit were very
respectful and we treated me like a
sister when we were off duty things were
going very well and I got the rank of
Lance Corporal and it was more hard work
I went on picked up corporal I thought I
was doing pretty good for two-and-a-half
years in and then we got a new staff
sergeant and things changed he had heard
that I like to run at lunchtime I had a
three-mile run that I usually ran and he
said tomorrow we&#39;re gonna take the
platoon on your run I said okay little
did I know he was setting me up so the
next day we headed out on my run and
there was a marine calling cadence and
we were less than halfway through the
run and he turned the whole unit around
I didn&#39;t know what was going on so I
continued my run and then I heard this
mouth breather coming up behind me so I
turned around and I see this junior
wearing a few paces back and I said what
are you doing he said Staff Sergeant
says I could keep an eye on you make
sure you&#39;re okay
I said of course I&#39;m okay I run this
every day I was shocked and I was hurt
and I knew from that point on that my
immediate leadership did not have my
back three years into my four-year
enlistment came a time that I was
sexually assaulted by another marine
I couldn&#39;t believe it was happening I
thought about all the things that I had
done the fact that I was looking at
reenlistment which was probably now gone
all the hard work that I put in and I
just didn&#39;t know what was going to
happen next I confided in two Marines
that were real good friends of mine
- male Marines and we decided that I
could not tell anybody because my
immediate supervisor did not have my
back the only way to explain it to you
is that military sexual trauma is like
telling your father that your brother
raped you
the betrayal can be as bad or worse than
the assault itself it&#39;s very personal
so I stuffed it for 30 years on the
outside things looked okay productive I
earned degrees I ran marathons I jumped
out of airplanes but inside things were
different I lived through 13 years of
domestic violence which I still believe
today had to do with not dealing with a
sexual assault in the first place I
raised two boys who were with me when
that relationship crumbled and I got to
be their mother and father and get them
through that I the only thing I had at
that point was staying extremely busy
and my writing filling lots of notebooks
with writing when I had no one else to
communicate with I didn&#39;t know then that
what I had was PTSD so I healed by
working with other veterans one of my
son&#39;s is also mine and he was in Iraq in
2006
his unit lost 11 killed in action and
many more wounded the VA has now
declared MiFi 100 percent disabled and
he&#39;s never going to be quite the same
anybody that&#39;s been to war will never be
quite the same your eyes going to have
some kind of effect from it so I&#39;m kind
of feeling so I went on to work with the
veterans as a Peer Support Specialists
of a VA hospital and I worked with the
social worker we would do something that
we called a warm handoff I would call
her and I would say I&#39;ve got a veteran
I&#39;m coming up and she would meet me at
the front door and take over from there
one day she called me it was July 3rd
2012 and she said when are you coming in
for yourself I had never said a word to
her I don&#39;t know how she knew she just
did so I came up to her office that
afternoon and we talked and I threw up
for 10 minutes straight and then we did
13 weeks of exposure therapy it helped
and I continued to write at that point I
was contacted by the Wounded Warrior
Project as my son&#39;s caregiver they sent
me an email that surprised me it said
come do some writing up in New York City
with the Writers Guild Initiative come
write with other veterans and caregivers
other mothers wives sisters and
girlfriends just spend three days so I
went to New York City and we all met and
we were kind of shy at first but then we
started to bond and as we bonded the
writing came along with the laughter and
the tears there was a lot of healing
that took place and it took a lot of
courage to get that stuff out
but it was very validating so at the end
of the three days I went home and I
thought about what had happened and I
thought I would love to have something
like this back here and I kept writing
and then I was contacted by someone at
the Lincoln VA and they said how would
you like to go to a writers group he
managed to Nebraska is putting one
together I said yeah I&#39;m in so we
started a writing workshop in 2014 that
is now expanded to Omaha and brand
Island we call ourselves Nebraska
warrior writers and we&#39;re still together
today the Writers Guild initiative and
the Nebraska warrior Writers groups do
some amazing work we also with the
Writers Guild Initiative have put
together a virtual writing group that
pulls together veterans from across the
country it&#39;s been very healing in 2015 I
was asked to go back east with the
Writers Guild
because alfre woodard was going to read
one of my pieces about resilience
through the generosity of friends and
family I was able to go hear my words
spoken by the kindest most generous
person she breathed life into my words
we kept writing and then towards the end
of the year we got the opportunity to do
some writing in the new veterans block
of the Douglas County Jail here in Omaha
I was so excited we started right before
Thanksgiving with seven veterans I met
with them and I said let&#39;s just do some
writing when you feel like you&#39;re ready
for it
I gave them each a few sheets of paper
and they had their flimsy little jail
pens I don&#39;t know if you guys have ever
seen anything like it it looks like the
middle of a big pen very hard to write
with anything like that and I said just
write something you can do a poem or a
song or you can even draw a picture I
gave them a choice in a place where they
had very few choices but a lot of time I
came back two following Monday and what
I saw
blew me away every one of them had
written something and one of them had
written 27 pages he had written on the
front and the back he had written on the
pages that the other guys didn&#39;t use he
had written on the back of the kites
which are the pages that they used to
ask for something when they&#39;re in jail
and anything else that he could find
pretty much what they had done was do
some healing through that writing it was
their therapy so we continued and then
at one point I asked an army captain to
come in he had been to Afghanistan and
Iraq and Ben was no slouch I knew that
he would bond with them and they would
they with him so he came in and he
brought in stories from Tim O&#39;Brien and
Phil clay and other world writers and
they did they began to write and share
stories and bond and a lot of healing
took place there it was very good for
all of them then towards the end of the
year I was asked by the writers guild
initiative to do some keynote speaking
at their gala the theme was change the
stories of transformation from the
workshops of the Writers Guild
what did I say I said to them I write
because I can&#39;t keep it in I also write
we write because the world needs to bear
witness to what we&#39;ve seen and where
we&#39;ve been as veterans there are
veterans and caregivers who are
struggling with the unseen wounds of war
and other traumas some of them are
suffering with the pain and the shame of
the things that they&#39;ve seen and done
and the fact that there are people who
don&#39;t want to hear about it and don&#39;t
want to see any of that is it any wonder
that we have at least 20 suicides a day
in our veteran population we veterans
lead the way in showing others how to
heal we all of us all of you sitting out
there are veterans of something some
trauma you know Maya Angelou once said
there is no greater agony than an untold
story inside of you so go ahead pick up
a pen thank you
you
