February 16 2015 a day I will never
forget I was on my way to the lost city
for the very first time in my life I&#39;ve
been waiting 21 years for this moment
and couldn&#39;t believe was actually
happening as I would look out the window
at the jungle covered mountains I
somehow had this thought that there&#39;s
absolutely no place to land in case of
an emergency we&#39;re screwed so I looked
behind me at a military helicopter
following us with other members of our
crew and I noticed it was kind of
rocking side to side pitching back and
forth and I went this doesn&#39;t seem right
so I asked my pilot is this normal and
he said absolutely not you look back and
before we knew it the other helicopter
was gone was nowhere to be seen as we
turned around we heard a garbled message
on the radio it was from the Honduran
military commander telling us that the
computerized stabilizers in their
helicopter were failing and the pilot
needed to immediately turn back and try
and make it back to the airfield
fortunately they did and all were safe
we would not have to alter our plans as
he waited for a replacement aircraft
such as the typical challenge in the
typical day in the life of an explorer
it all began in 1994 when I was working
as a cameraman and partner in a
production services company in Burbank
California I had grown tired of being a
contractor to the entertainment industry
and decided to be a good idea to start
creating some of my own programming so I
began to look for ideas particularly
ones that catered to my native interest
in science and adventure by chance a
director friend of mine introduced me to
a real live treasure hunter and Explorer
type his name was Steve Morgan although
he preferred to be called Captain Morgan
because he had an affinity to the
character in the rum ads Steve had
written a number of very short stories
about adventures he had done and wanted
to do and thought they would be great
for a TV show one of those stories was
about a legendary lost city in the
Mosquitia jungle of Eastern Honduras the
place had two names Ciudad Blanca which
means white city in Spanish because
allegedly
buildings are made out of white stone
and lost city the monkey-god because
supposedly the people who live there
worship the monkey God
explorers had been looking for this
place ever since the conquistador Hernan
Cortes first wrote about it in 1526
the Smithsonian even sent three
expeditions in the 1930s some explorers
would return with fantastical stories
and enigmatic artifacts while others
unfortunately never returned mainly
because the Mosquitia was one of the
least explored and roughest jungles in
the world it still is actually with
unbroken 50-meter canopy steep mountains
vast rivers swamps incredibly thick
vegetation and some of the deadliest
wildlife in the Americas if you look at
this old map from 1858 you&#39;ll notice
that in red it&#39;s highlighted Portal del
inferno it was once known as the gates
of Hell as Morgan was telling me the
rest of the story I knew immediately
that this would be a great pilot for a
TV series I was going to call tales of
adventure I didn&#39;t know however at the
time that my eventual quest for the lost
city would lead me down a path that
would create a legacy and help change
the attitudes of a country Morgan told
me that he could arrange all the
everything that had to be arranged in
Honduras and all I had to do was just
raise the money of course and take care
of the TV production I really had no
idea what what to do in a jungle or how
to make things happen in Honduras I even
thought maybe I could find a book called
finding a lost city for dummies but
there wasn&#39;t such a thing
so I did the next best thing which was
take a deep breath hold it cross my
fingers and hope the heck that Morgan
knew what he was doing because I didn&#39;t
however in all fairness I did study
archaeology in the earth sciences well
in college so I suppose I had some ideas
or delusions of what such an adventure
would be like especially when I moved to
Los Angeles in 1979 to work as my father
in the business selling hot dogs out of
a giant Wienermobile at Venice Beach
back then I was only looking for the
lost bag of french fries
fortunately Morgan had a good friend and
fellow adventurer named Bruce Heinicke
bruce was going to become our fixer in
Honduras and take care of all the
government permits and local logistics
he had lived in Honduras for a number of
years married to Honduran woman and
really knew his way around if you know
what I mean he looked like a character
right I have a central casting for a
b-movie with his large frame gruff
demeanor gold chain pinkie ring and it
don&#39;t screw with me attitude I was
really happy that he was on my payroll
and only hoped that it would stay that
way before long we were in Honduras
traveling and dugout canoes over
crocodile infested waters on a dark and
moonless night suddenly there was this
big bang in screams two of the canoes
collided and they almost tipped
completely over and I thought my god
what are we doing here we&#39;re all gonna
die we&#39;re never gonna get home well
obviously we survived because I&#39;m
standing here several days later after
slogging through the rainforest came
upon this very interesting Boulder next
to a river carved into the stone was
this amazing image of a man with a
strange hat or headdress on a mask a
digging stick and what appeared to be a
gourd with seeds falling out of it at
least that&#39;s what the expedition
archaeologists told us I immediately had
an epiphany I thought here we are in the
middle of the rainforest high up in the
mountains far away from any human
dwellings
what&#39;s a carving of a man planting seeds
doing in a place like this I mean no way
you could imagine this is farmland it&#39;s
just all jungle he could barely see 20
feet I did know however that
environments can and do change over time
so perhaps it was once a more open
landscape in the past either naturally
or modified by the people who once lived
there from that moment on I became
obsessed with trying to find Sita Blanca
or at least proving whether or not it
really existed
the 1994 expedition was followed by
several others in the next few years
each one lead
a bit more to solving the puzzle but
never coming to a definitive conclusion
I started to become rather discouraged
especially when my family was tired of
hearing the stories and my wife would
beg me don&#39;t you ever mention the words
Honduras and lost city in this house
again or I&#39;m leaving so being a prudent
person I thought it was a good idea to
move on with my life
which I did however I could not keep
seeing a Blanca or lost city out of the
back of my mind in 2010 I was reading an
article in archaeology magazine about a
new technology called airborne lidar it
was being used experimentally at a Maya
site in Belize the idea was to see if
airborne lidar could be used to uncover
unknown archaeological sites in the
surrounding jungle to everyone&#39;s
amazement it worked much better than
expected no longer would you have to
slowly trudge through the jungle hoping
that you&#39;re going to stumble on some
rune those days were over now you could
scan large areas quickly and efficiently
from the relative comfort of an airplane
this was a game-changing technology
particularly for archaeological survey
sea light our works a bit like radar and
sonar except it uses laser beams instead
to create 3d images of whatever it can
scan and best of all for my purposes it
would allow me to digitally erase the
vegetation and expose the ruins
underneath this was amazing I thought if
I ever have the chance to go looking for
Sita Blanca again this is what I&#39;m gonna
do
forget the blind leading the blind
through the jungle my attitude was
goodbye Indiana Jones and hello Kem Kirk
I&#39;m going with you in this high-tech
stuff from now on coincidentally just a
few days after that and this is very
strange I get a call from Morgan&#39;s
friend Bruce the guy who was our fixer I
hadn&#39;t heard from him in 10 years not
sure I really wanted to but I did he
said he had an in with the new Honduran
president and they wanted to know if I
was interested in looking for Sierra
Blanca again and making a film about it
my initial reaction was are you kidding
if I could get my hands on this airborne
lidar and combine it with the
president&#39;s offer to support the mission
I had a winning combination I mean
when else in my life would I ever have a
president of a country invite me to
pursue one of my dreams after that with
the help of a few friends in the
filmmaker named Bill Benenson we spent
the next two years organizing to light
our mission with making plans to make a
film about it it all seems so easy until
it wasn&#39;t every day brought challenges
Honduras was really a dangerous place at
the time we had the highest murder rate
per capita in the world drugs gangs and
corruption ruled the day we had to take
extreme precautions in fact we had to
have heavily armed soldiers guard our
light our plane 24/7 plus we had to fly
at least a hundred miles a day out of
our way just to refuel the aircraft at a
secure military facility no matter how
well we were prepared something always
went wrong one of the worst times was
when the lidar machine broke in the
middle of the mission and we found out
the only replacement heart in the world
and was going to take days to get to us
if at all plus we&#39;re spending twenty
thousand dollars a day while we&#39;re just
sitting around waiting I lost a few
remaining here as I had in my head on
that one eventually though we were able
to map a large portion of the Mosquitia
it was essentially unknown and it
included happened to include not one but
two lost cities precisely in the areas
that I had targeted from my research
over the years as you can see from this
picture I was quite happy i felt quite
vindicated now as always doing
cartwheels and here are three images
that show you what we first saw this is
how the light are viewed the lost city
area the green represents the trees in
the jungle and the blue is a little
river you can&#39;t see anything underneath
well with the magical lidar we erased
the vegetation in the next slide and
it&#39;s like looking at the Moon or Mars
and if you look in the River Valley
you&#39;ll see there&#39;s various geometric
shapes squares pyramids and other things
that represent plazas pyramids and
whatever anyway after we saw those
images the president called and he
requested that I brief him in his
cabinet at a special meeting the next
day everybody there was thrilled to have
such great news emanate from their
country after year
of bad news the world media went crazy
later that year I was at it I was
surrounded by all kinds of movers and
shakers at an event in Washington DC
sponsored by foreign policy magazine
someone from the World Bank approached
me and said would you like us to help
you with your project and I said yeah
sure he said well the first thing you
gotta do is figure out how your project
can benefit Honduras financially I mean
he&#39;s a banker what else is he going to
say right so I thought about it and said
well it could possibly help develop some
sustainable ecotourism which could
attract more international goodwill
which could also then maybe turn into
foreign investment my mantra is that the
Mosquitia is a rare jewel not only for
Honduras but for the whole world rather
than a few people making a lot of money
from destroying the jungle and looting
the ruins this could be a gift that
keeps on giving for generations have
cared for properly well much to my
surprise almost everybody including the
government officials thought this was a
great idea and they made it a priority
now that I had opened Pandora&#39;s box
I felt the moral obligation to try and
guide the future of the project in the
best possible way in the future I knew
we had amount of ground expedition to
verify the lidar findings plus we needed
to also study the jungle itself this
would require assembling a top-notch
team of scientists from a variety of
disciplines it took three years until
2015 to organize this mission it was far
more complicated and risky than the
original light our survey is now we
would have to go in by helicopter and
hack our way through the jungle to hedge
my bets and keep us alive I wound up
hiring three British SAS jungle warfare
experts plus the Hondurans Gruen
graciously some of their Special Forces
soldiers conditions were really tough at
times everyday we had an encounter with
the fair - Lance Viper the deadliest
snake in the Americas inch-and-a-quarter
fangs in a strike now ask questions
later attitude
we were constantly bombarded by biting
insects and surrounded by mud so much
mud that our anthropologists had to be
rescued from a mud pit as she was slowly
sinking beyond her waist this is the mud
pit I couldn&#39;t we don&#39;t have a picture
of her sinking because we were too busy
rescuing her I would sometimes sit in my
tent listening to the incessant rain and
wondering once again why did I come here
and bring all these people to a place
that was once called the gates of hell
it was a combination of Indiana Jones
Star Trek and Rambo mixed in with some
serious scientific study I mean
everybody who was there was so impressed
with just how untouched and pristine the
ruins in the jungle were at times was
really almost like a religious
experience and I&#39;m being very serious
about that it&#39;s very rare to find a
place like this in addition to the
pyramids and the plazas and other
structures that were identified by the
lidar we also came upon this wonderful
cache of beautifully carved stone bowls
vases and effigies that were created by
a culture in the words of the chief
hunter and archaeologist who was with us
we know absolutely nothing about them so
this was a brand-new culture no one knew
anything about news of the successful
ground operation spread quickly and the
Honduran government became even more
committed to sustained Lee preserving
both their natural and cultural
patrimony in fact the president of
Honduras made a statement at the Paris
climate conference stating that he would
protect the rainforest from that point
forward this was a very big deal in
addition to that the Hondurans also
organized a special military unit their
mission was called operation forest and
their mandate was to patrol the jungle
from that point forward and prevent any
incursions by narco traffickers looters
and illegal to foresters we began to
work with the government National
Geographic and Conservation
International to start excavating the
ruins and staying studying the unique
flora and fauna of the jungle the
government even declared the area
a special heritage protected Heritage
Site and started working with UNESCO
which is part of the United Nations for
those of you who don&#39;t know in extending
whatever international legal protections
were available a nonfiction book was
written about the project became a New
York Times bestseller which was followed
by the president of Honduras and the US
ambassador honoring us at a special
ceremony for me this was an amazing
validation after 23 years of pursuing
what most people including myself
thought was a totally ridiculous idea
the government also issued these two
stamps in honor of the project I never
ever thought in my life that I would be
involved with something that would be
memorialized or commemorated on a
postage stamp in the end all of us have
the ability to change the world an
unanticipated ways both large and small
when an idea or an opportunity presents
itself we just have to rise up take
action and not just think about it
that&#39;s what&#39;s going to make the
difference in the end
thank you
[Applause]
