when I say schooling is a mechanism for
racial control does that make you
uncomfortable saying it makes me cringe
a little slavery was a mechanism for
racial control right but what could be
more debilitating to a child and to a
nation than a child being miseducated i
was born prematurely to a teen mom in
the summer of 1973 on the very next day
the other mothers in my hometown filed
suit against the local public school
district for failing to deliver the
promises of brown versus the Board of
Education 20 years after it was decided
for the rest of America they had to wait
until I got here
when I was a girl 20% of my waking hours
were entrusted to schools the integrated
buildings I was bused to were places of
refuge and intolerance I love school
because books were there I hated schools
because I was misunderstood I wanted
something for my teachers that they
couldn&#39;t give me or didn&#39;t know they
needed to I knew that certain labels
mattered to my teachers Shelley has a
single mother my mama was married my dad
lived in a different state showing these
special ed services because when she
finally speaks we don&#39;t understand what
she&#39;s saying
not Shelley got her Mama&#39;s Mississippi
accent Shelly&#39;s family lives in poverty
not that we lived with my
great-grandparents who were homeowners
who had migrated from Mississippi for a
better life when I was a girl you could
not have told me that my experience was
abnormal it was my normal I loved my
family in my neighborhood I loved that
house with a huge vegetable garden and
peach trees in the middle of the city
where Gardens should not grow
I loved Colts Park and playing on the
big slide and laughing with my sister
and cousins on the weekends and then I&#39;d
have to go back to school some of my
teachers labels were missed labels the
kid next to Shelly can&#39;t speak English
well not the kid sitting next to her is
brilliant because he speaks two
languages her classmates are not reading
proficiently not that they&#39;re reading
fuck that they&#39;re functionally literate
with everything they want to read like
my aunts romance novels
I wondered what the other well-meaning
white folks in my life like if they knew
my teachers the caseworkers the police
officers who had shown up a few weekends
the doctors treated my mama&#39;s mental
illness my teachers really didn&#39;t know
what to do with me
I was super smart but painfully silent
like I did not speak at school when all
hell was breaking loose in my life I
ended up being forced to move from my
home to joy in Burton&#39;s home to people
who were much more than just
well-meaning white folks to me at school
when I finally did speak the other black
kids thought I was an Oreo black on the
outside white on the inside I didn&#39;t fit
in with the white kids in my advanced
classes either I chose to walk out with
the other black kids at our school&#39;s
race riot though but not without taking
miss Kelly&#39;s English test first I was a
bona fide nerd I started speaking out
against racism at about 16 years old
through teen racial roundtables and a
talk show on the radio I decided that
schools actually good could be spaces
for racial healing so I decided to
become a teacher I went to college moved
out on my own had beautiful babies and
tried not to allow the stigma of being a
single mom on welfare to define me after
nine years I finished college got my
teaching certificate I got married I
landed my first teaching job I was a
master teacher they took that&#39;s what
they said anyway I was a master teacher
I love my students like they were my own
there&#39;d be no achievement gap in my
classroom I wanted to give my students
something that I had never gotten I had
five children of my own so the beautiful
babies kept coming I thought juggling
motherhood and teaching was really hard
but teaching while black was harder
it was probably like Tekin teaching
excuse me working while black in any
other job being one of the only working
twice as hard to get half as far
explaining away black kids failed test
taking explaining why so many black boys
were in the in-school suspension room
the other teachers needed to hear from
me that pitying black kids coddling them
and a molting about how inconvenient
their problems are for you
solve nothing after I had my last child
RJ and about seven years in I was tired
I left teaching plagued with questions
how could we have created this dire
condition in education where this many
black kids were at the bottom of every
positive school ranking the worst and at
the very top of most negative school
metrics the best at being bad
what if asking teachers to fix broken
kids is a waste of time because the
system is functioning precisely as it
was designed to fail black kids in order
for you to understand how schooling
could be a mechanism for racial control
you must understand how it works it
starts with this socially created lie
that black kids are biologically
different than other kids like the black
kid is a monolith and they&#39;re all the
same we perpetuate this lie with the
reproduction of white culture and that
changes how we perceive kids so when my
son RJ who&#39;s now 11 walks into his math
class he&#39;s perceived a certain way he
won&#39;t know what he needs to know he
won&#39;t have what he needs to have and
he&#39;ll misbehave RJ is nothing like the
black kid he&#39;s a hardcore gamer he&#39;s
quiet proudly weird
and carefree
remember when you had to do those times
drill math sheets in elementary school
doing well with something like that
could like RJ could care less about
doing well with something like that he&#39;d
be like you know I know the answers
right why do I have to rush is there a
prize so by the time he&#39;s failing his
6th grade math tests his inferiority is
actually confirmed and they&#39;ll keep
collecting data about his failure to
prove whatever they want to prove about
kids like him by the time he&#39;s his math
teacher is calling me and I still
haven&#39;t returned the call by the way but
by the time his math teacher is calling
me he&#39;s wanting to know what&#39;s going on
with RJ and what uh what I&#39;d like to say
to him is RJ don&#39;t care about finding
the least common denominator
can you tell him how math and technology
make video game characters Carine around
a corner in a racecar at high speeds
without spinning out that&#39;s the kind of
stuff he wants to know but not the kind
of talk his teacher wants to have by the
time RJ gets to high school he will
never have been exposed to some of the
math that he needs for the AC T another
legitimised sir of college read another
legitimise predictor of college
readiness his life options could be
limited especially if his self-efficacy
is low and his spirit is wearied and
remember is based on this socially
created lie that we just keep retelling
about black kids but instead of calling
it a lie we try to address the symptoms
and the supposed bad actors we try to
assume that his struggles are the sum of
his experiences and his lack of effort
and that his parents and his teachers
aren&#39;t doing enough either the white
architects of
Cooling have controlled the outcomes of
countless students for a lot of years
instead of patching up individual folks
let&#39;s fix the system that keeps
reproducing them over and over how do we
implement an anti-racist education
equation we start by mobilizing a
critical mass of influencers youth
parents teachers community members
business stakeholders policymakers
funders you me that&#39;s all of us our
mobilisation has to start with our
conversations we must together use our
influence to defy the lie about the
inferiority of black kids we need to
continue mobilizing until we see the
kind of change that results in
anti-racist decision-making in our
schools our conversation must convert to
collective action we need to make sure
that we&#39;re focused more on assets than
on assumptions more on systems than on
sentence less on training and more on
transformation we must plan implement
and stay the course we will pass through
failure on our way to success we won&#39;t
give up because the gaps don&#39;t close
overnight they were not created
overnight will press forward until we
see the kind of change that results in
schooling where race is no longer a
predictor of educational outcomes
students forgive us for paying more
attention to your labels than your lived
experiences teachers forgive us for not
seeing you as solutions and not
supporting you well you who are not
teachers you are influencers right where
you are the other place racialization
happens is on your job and in your own
homes
so where will you start I&#39;ll start with
my babies I&#39;m telling them to be there
black nerdy cells and to deploy their
smarts and their swagger at their
leisure I&#39;m telling them that they can
take a job or make a job doing whatever
they dream of most of my kids are quiet
like I was when I was a girl I want to
unlock their voices I want to unlock
your voice
what conversation will you have first
push past any discomforts you have and
do it but remember dialogue is not
action dialogue prepares us for the kind
of action that creates lasting change
together thank you
