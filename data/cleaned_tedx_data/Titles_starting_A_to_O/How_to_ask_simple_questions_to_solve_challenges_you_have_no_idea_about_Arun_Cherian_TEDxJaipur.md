hello everyone
worldwide there are over 40 million
amputees that is people without a part
of their leg hand or more in India of
the millions of amputees 90 to 95
percent of them don&#39;t have access to an
effective solution to go about their
day-to-day lives the largest cause of
amputation is diabetes then grow traffic
accidents and then war an India
if the diabetic capital of the world
it&#39;s only gonna get worse than the
coming decades and in fact the most
common kind of amputation is that of the
leg for a moment imagine without any
warning you lose your leg would you be
able to walk the same way would you be
able to go about work the same way let
alone run player dance can you about
come to terms with this reality the
harsh reality for most amputees is that
they either lose their jobs or they earn
significantly less than before which
results in reduced social interaction
leading to further isolation and many a
time a close family member has to become
a caretaker resulting in in them having
reduced income generation now
prosthetics have been around for 2,000
years from the wooden peg leg to carbon
fiber prosthetics with which everybody
people can run faster than normal but
yet 90 to 95 percent of people you tease
in India don&#39;t have access to an
effective solution this is not just a
health or a societal issue it&#39;s also an
economic issue
sure I&#39;d like to tell share with you how
I have an engineer I&#39;m developing high
quality cost-effective prosthetic legs
for the masses not just for India but
also Asia Africa and South America
wherein people can not just walk and
work longer but also run play and dance
now to understand this better I traveled
across India talking to doctors from
multiple hospitals organizations and
even amputees to better understand what
are the challenges what were their
experiences like why are things the way
they are because they are in the field
they know best and to summarize my
understanding into three points first
there is the need for appropriate
technology - there is a need for
awareness and three that if the need for
accessibility of such technology at
scale now let&#39;s take the first one
appropriate technology you see the human
leg if made for movement it&#39;s naturally
light and weight it&#39;s flexible but the
prosthetics that we give out for free
they are inherently rigid inflexible and
heavy now as an engineer I have thumb
background when it comes to making legs
or robots that walk I was developing
these wearable exoskeleton suits that
help paralyzed people who are completely
wheelchair bound to be able to stand up
and walk they would cost about a hundred
thousand dollars but the point is the
human leg is essentially a spring simply
said now it turns out whether you&#39;re an
elephant lion human a little mouse or a
spider
mathematically we all essentially walked
the same the human leg is a spring back
at home we have the skin furniture
that&#39;s bent in all these beautiful
shapes and you can sit on it you see if
it&#39;s bent and you can sit that&#39;s a
spring of sorts and so for me it was
really a curiosity bees question if keen
is a spring and the human leg is a
spring can I make a leg out of cane it
really was a kid you have to be this
question should I understand this better
I went talking to artisans so he went to
the artisan down the road and I asked
him you know can you make came in about
this the shape and he was like sure I
say okay can you make cane about that
just big the size of a human leg he&#39;s
like sure okay can I can I take about
the weight of a human body about and
more maybe about 150 kg to 200 and he&#39;s
like sure okay that&#39;s interesting and
then he made me a couple of pieces and
then I went searching for a mechanical
lab with which I had to test him so I
know for sure it could really take the
weight and after asking around I finally
ended up at the aerospace department at
the Indonesian of Science Bangalore
under professor amar but now they work
with Spieth great composites like carbon
fiber it turns out King 2 is a natural
composite and they had just a machine to
test King so we put the King leg into
the Machine and ran it and it worked far
better than we expected so now we know
that cane is strong enough but I don&#39;t
know how to make prosthetic legs like
I&#39;ve worked with robots but not not with
wood or not even made these kinds of
prosthetics so I went searching for
organizations that made such and I
eventually ended up at the association
of people with disability in Bangalore
they&#39;ve been making prosthetic
for all 50 years way longer than I have
and then through together we made early
prototypes of this prosthetic leg and
now and one of the users are amputees
from the association of people with
disability came into volunteered to use
the prosthetic leg and and he&#39;s a child
who lost both his legs he&#39;s more like a
grown man he lost both his legs above
his knee with very short stumps and that
doesn&#39;t really allow him to walk much
now for the past nine years he needed
two crutches to walk with his prosthetic
legs so after making these cane
prosthetics and fitting it he would come
one hour a day for training and by the
third hour more like the third hour of
wearing the prosthetic leg this is the
first time the child is able to walk
without crutches for the very first time
you&#39;ll see he&#39;s wobbling a lot that&#39;s
because using crutches his core muscles
became weak but then by the fifth hour
or he was able to do things like kicking
the football and and even the other
users were like this is awesome it is
lightweight it&#39;s flexible hugely cost
effective but it looks weird because
they just want a leg that looks normal
and they&#39;re like can you make it look
like a real leg so then I can goop I can
take it to whom I can take it to office
and then people will talk about it and I
can just go about living my normal life
and it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s interesting you
know this is at the end of the day only
a tool by which they can live a better
life
nothing more should and together we
worked with we developed these cosmetic
covers that make it look more like a leg
inside of it is keen we also have
digitally printed skin texture that can
be color matched to the person&#39;s skin
tone making it very realistic-looking
and in fact then we have one of our
early users he started taking this to
work and when with the previous leg he
could wear it for three hours and then
get tired with this since it looks more
like a leg and it&#39;s light and weight and
flexible he&#39;s able to wear this for 13
hours being able to work longer and earn
a better income so it&#39;s fair to say that
it&#39;s reasonably appropriate it&#39;s
lightweight flexible now it&#39;s important
to get the word out and create awareness
because you see nobody chooses to be an
amputee it happens almost instantly and
many a time the patient or even the near
family are mentally not prepared to
handle this they aren&#39;t even aware of
what amputation is should create
awareness we created something called
the programs the sports program
the dance program the fitness program
wherein we encourage our users to take
up these activities and we connect them
with world-class coaches and provide all
the necessary support needed and our
early users have done things like
marathons this is a person who lost his
leg about five years ago and he designed
his own art leg and he took a
bodybuilding and now he&#39;s a fitness
trainer to able-bodied people we also
create we also have community gatherings
where we have amputees come all across
and have fun with each other and learn
together about what they can do cannot
do
it&#39;s amazing the the energy and fun they
have we also had the honor to take part
in Cybertron which is an international
competition for prosthetic legs being
one segment and we were the only team
from India that got selected and we were
competing with we were competing with
Auto Bach with is a German company that
that&#39;s the largest manufacturer of
prosthetic legs and then also they
create they make the fastest lakes and
the one of the lightest they came in
with a system worth $100,000 and ours is
significantly cheaper than that
significantly and out of the tree and
there were three races obstacle races of
the three races in two races our boys
time first and the second race three
times second and all of this together
has resulted in extremely positive
stories of our users and cut the word
around and now we have thousands of
people from across India reaching out to
us and not just from India from Sierra
Leone to Tunisia to West Indies to
Mexico to Argentina people have been
reaching out for the prosthesis now
which leads to the third facet of now
making it accessible to the masses
if he in India there are far too few
prosperous especially educated to the
need
of a large country like India and in
fact not just are the lack of
prosthetist even the processing world is
very cumbersome with plaster of Paris
moulding it&#39;s time to you have to wait
depending on the weather
it&#39;ll set and if you don&#39;t get it right
the first time then you have to start
all over again it&#39;s cumbersome fragile
time-consuming and it just isn&#39;t
scalable so now really using appropriate
technology like compact 3d scanners that
can be deployed in a remote village a
person can scan it upload it to the
cloud and we use a set of open-source
software we can digitally modify it and
intra fusing importing complex machines
we&#39;ve modified the process so you can
use readily available machines and
material to make a to make the circuit
will emit a method that will otherwise
take eight hours with plaster of Paris
or really about two to three days with
all the delays we can do it in less than
an hour and now with this we are working
with world-class partners like the T lab
from MIT the International Red Cross in
Geneva and amazing a local partners beat
central cmp veil or st. john&#39;s hospital
the authority to people with disability
mobility in their far so many partners
to help us fine tune this process now
you see we are working with extremely
smart people from different facets like
from engineer from manufacturing to
textile to furniture to bring in their
best practices into the medical industry
in making better prosthetics just so
that we can improve people&#39;s lives think
of it like the people around you having
a small piece to the puzzle that you&#39;re
trying to solve and you see there are
many many real challenges around us that
require a multi-faceted nuanced approach
to really effectively solve it and you
don&#39;t have to be an engineer or a doctor
or a specialist in a field to solve it
if there is if you can identify a
challenge around you that genuinely
matters to you it&#39;s okay if you
immediately don&#39;t have all the answers
if you can ask the right questions to
the people around you that together you
can form an effective solution to the
challenge and genuinely make the world a
better place thank you
