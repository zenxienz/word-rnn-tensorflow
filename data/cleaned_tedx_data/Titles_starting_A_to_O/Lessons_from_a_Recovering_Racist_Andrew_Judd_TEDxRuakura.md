katoa KO andrew jad took &#39;when you were
on the 8th of october 1769 Captain James
Cook of the British Royal Navy and in
command of the HMS Endeavour sailed into
a Bay in the North Island of New Zealand
and this day was to be the first
encounter between the indigenous people
of New Zealand the Maori and the British
Maori were to name Europeans Pakeha 71
years later on the 6th of February 1840
the British crown and most Maori Chiefs
were to sign a treaty known as the
Treaty of Waitangi this treaty was to be
the founding document between two
cultures and laid out the partnership
principles to build a new nation whilst
protecting the indigenous rights of the
Maori the treaty was in fact written in
two languages today are Maori and
English the two texts did not translate
to match each other following the treaty
signing New Zealand saw mass European
immigration and the colonization of New
Zealand and with a greed for Maori land
settler New Zealand governments passed
legislation against Maori which
contravened human rights disputes led to
war the consequence to Maori was mass
Maori land confiscation and theft by the
crown this forced Maori into social and
economic deprivation and isolation
continuous New Zealand government&#39;s
would ignore and breach the Treaty of
Waitangi and to this very day in New
Zealand exists recent legislation that
works only against Maori someone once
said to me
Mary&#39;s a lazy Mary&#39;s fool our jails the
merry elite brought the system for their
own gain and the rest they just want
social welfare handouts
Mary&#39;s are lucky they got saved by the
British and their language is all but
dead and I&#39;m sick and tired of hearing
about the past they&#39;ve got to get over
it and move on in any case we&#39;re all one
now do you know who said that to me I
said that to me my name is Andrew judge
and I am a recovering racist
in 2013 I was elected mayor of the New
Plymouth District and one of my first
challenges was the question of Maori
representation on council EC in New
Zealand Council&#39;s are required under the
Local Government Act to include Maori in
the decision-making of councils in one
of the options to fulfill this
requirement is to establish an elected
seat on council for Maori just as we
have elected seats for Maori in our
Parliament having tried and failed to
secure Maori voices at council
subcommittees it was this option of an
elected Maori seat that our Council
voted to establish this decision ignited
an angry community response a response
that not only I recognized I identified
with you know until I was elected the
mayor well I&#39;d never set foot on him at
I I had no understanding or appreciation
of Maori values customs or protocols ger
I couldn&#39;t even pronounce basic Maori
New Zealand place names and becoming
them here well I was engaging with Maori
in a Maori environment I was witnessing
the challenges that exist for Maori the
consequences of colonisation they are so
very real for Maori their eyes spoke of
the intergenerational trauma is I heard
of the full history of New Zealand&#39;s
colonial past because I took all the sin
I was having an internal conflict this
new experience with Maori Dan was at
odds with my deep-seated belief of who I
thought Maori were and are my sanitized
colonial view of New Zealand&#39;s history
was getting challenged to the core as I
discovered I knew nothing now could this
be let&#39;s be honest in mainstream New
Zealand we raise our children to have no
knowledge on New Zealand&#39;s full colonial
past we don&#39;t talk about it we don&#39;t
teach it
we simply demand that marys get over it
I decided to challenge myself ask myself
some deep and a personal questions about
this could I as a New Zealand born and
raised Pacquiao or could anyone
non-maori truly explain or define the
earth and the statement leveled at Maori
get over it I hadn&#39;t grown up in New
Zealand having to deal with the emotion
and the knowledge that my ancestral land
had been stolen by my government my
treaty partner sold off to fund the
infrastructure that built her nation
that we all enjoy today to have the
crown of today recognised that wrong but
double down by offering a few measly
cents in the dollar in compensation I
hadn&#39;t grown up in New Zealand having to
deal with the emotion that on all those
horrendous statistics against my culture
in health education poverty homelessness
the disproportionate incarceration rates
her a direct result of policies put in
place from the ideology in worldview of
another culture I hadn&#39;t grown up in New
Zealand having to deal with the emotion
and the knowledge that my native
language had been actively denied and
removed by the education system and I
hadn&#39;t grown up in New Zealand having to
experience life as a minority in my own
country no I kind of define or explain
the it because that never happened to me
and yet without any an immoral dialogue
to ever stop and consider my thoughts my
words or my attitude I felt I had some
right to place an expectation a
judgement on to Maori an expectation
another judgment that never had to be
placed on me
who did I think I was the ease at which
these questions were deflected was
amazing the comebacks I didn&#39;t want to
know about it I think I was thinking
about it but there&#39;s no consequence for
me do I care
life goes on for me I decided to ask
myself why I&#39;d get so angry
whenever I considered anything to do
with multi-donor not just angry a real
anger I mean I couldn&#39;t look at a Maori
flag without feeling somehow intimidated
the the things I&#39;d say this is what
happens throughout history well they
can&#39;t be stuck there forever it&#39;s just
one long grievance train women will have
enough be enough move on
bloody Nerys you know if what I was
thinking and feeling was the truth why
was I so angry nothing has if or heaven
to me personally why am i angry because
if what I think and feel is to the truth
that&#39;s it you free right it shouldn&#39;t
make me feel like I feel what&#39;s wrong
with me I deflect well at least when I
cost raelia I know right what an odd
thing to say when you think about that
cuz what&#39;s that even supposed to me
right what I&#39;ll judge how bad I am I
won&#39;t admit how bad our I am but I&#39;ll
judge how better I am based on someone
who I think is worse my ultimate place
my get out of having to think about it
card well don&#39;t blame me I mean I didn&#39;t
steal the land or stop the language it&#39;s
not my fault who know I didn&#39;t steal the
land or stop the language but I have
remained completely ignorant and the
ignorant that drove an attitude that in
so many ways justifies what was done but
even worse continues to colonize
I didn&#39;t stop there I kept saying things
to myself around why I was feeling this
conflict another statement or that I
would often make where we&#39;re all one now
in any case but think about this if
we&#39;re all one then let&#39;s all be Maori
we&#39;re in New Zealand we&#39;re all one
let&#39;s all be Maori because whose view of
one are we
yes we&#39;re one citizen but to suggest
that we&#39;re one is to deny Maori the
right to identify in be Maori who gave
me that right so what&#39;s my culture was
my next question of myself because I&#39;m
not Maori but I&#39;m not British or English
neither I&#39;m a Paki a New Zealander
what&#39;s my culture you know if I&#39;ll I was
invited to to a gathering tonight for a
meal of cultures from around the world
come dressed in your national costume
injury something that resembles your
culture what would I wear black singlet
shorts red bean gum boots
I&#39;m not a farmer rugby Jersey but really
angel I thought deeper than that not a
sport or a job or iconic products like
buzzy bees and tip-top ice-cream what
are my cultural values I mean what do I
believe in what do I stand for what
would I fall for a certainly great Maori
culture when it suits how cuppa for a
rugby match yeah school poverty
traditional Maori welcoming of foreign
dignitaries yep absolutely fair hang on
I don&#39;t know how to do a haka and I
don&#39;t even know what that means or what
they&#39;re saying but we&#39;re all one right
so my community was at odds with this
whole question of Maori representation
is indeed was the country and although
New Zealand legislation allows for a
council to establish an elected seat for
Maori just as we have elected seats for
Maori in Parliament New Zealand
legislation also allows for community to
demand a binding referendum on that
decision no other seat on the council
and there are others can have binding
referendums just the Mayoress and on the
15th of May 2015
175 years since the signing of the
Treaty of Waitangi 83% of my community
who voted in that referendum said no
having stood foreign championed fairer
representation as treaty partners life
was never to be the same I was in white
Terra beautiful town and Taranaki
getting some lunch
in his eyes of the counter paying for my
lunch
thus Maori gentleman came up and said
well I want to pay for your lunch so we
don&#39;t have to do that so I&#39;d be offended
if you don&#39;t let me I saw you walking
and I was too shy to come over
but I had to not mean he stand up for my
people and I&#39;d like to pay for your
lunch
beautiful humbling moment and as I
thanked him and lived waiting on the
pavement was a gentleman who came at me
and said I thought it was you that went
in there now listen I voted for you to
sort these natives out and you have
mucked it up and we all hate you for it
hate you a kiss and a slap within five
minutes from two strangers but a
realization for I could not judge this
angry man for he is me and I am him both
Puckey huh with a deep unjust fear
within I decided to not seek reelection
at the end of my to be a one to me not
because I didn&#39;t want to this was
different
this wasn&#39;t a question of potholes on
roads art galleries parks and rates this
was a question of who we are as New
Zealanders how we care and love each
other I couldn&#39;t become the bait for
hate in an election campaign not only do
we remain divided the children are
watching the children are learning you
know I don&#39;t speak on behalf of or for
pakiya I speak as parkia and in all of
those horrendous statistics that we talk
about former edom and health education
poverty incarceration rates puppy her at
the problem we always have been we take
no ownership of anything into our hearts
you know we simply point and blame Maori
for essentially what not only we did but
what we continue to do it&#39;s bad enough
we lie to the world and how horrendous
Lee we&#39;ve treated Maori what&#39;s worse as
we lie to ourselves
puggy Harrell so the solution challenge
the fear that someone else has put the
yeah we&#39;re not born this way
truly truly learn of our full colonial
past not to name shame or to blame but
to understand to have empathy demand of
each other that we acknowledge our
treaty that we celebrate respect our
differences but above all look into your
heart and ask yourself the questions
because only you can be honest with you
and as the prophets of peace so message
to humanity he could audio keep the
Ottawa air dongha tower him on our own
go keep the fee noah if a carro pi
kidnapped an gotta katoa glory to God on
high peace and goodwill to all mankind
