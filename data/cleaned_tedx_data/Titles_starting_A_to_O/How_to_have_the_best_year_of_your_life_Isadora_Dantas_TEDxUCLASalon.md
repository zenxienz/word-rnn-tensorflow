hello so everybody has a unique gift
right we all heard that before well for
a long time I had no idea what mine was
and I tried everything I tried to sing I
tried to act I tried to dance and it was
always a disaster
I searched for it through school than
through college and different jobs and
as you had no idea what it was but then
one thing that remained consistent
throughout that time is that every once
in a while someone who just asked me
something like is it
how are you always so happy and after
hearing that repeatedly I realized that
maybe that was my unique gift I did seem
to be genuinely happy and until recently
I saw this article that someone
discovered that there is a version of a
gene that makes people more cheerful
than average and I didn&#39;t get my DNA
test yet but I&#39;m really excited because
that might be my closest shot to become
an x-man I was so good at being happy
that until quite recently I had no idea
how hard it was to be such and don&#39;t get
me wrong I do get sad and it&#39;s very ugly
you don&#39;t want to know but for some
reason I can always find the positive
side and get back to my happy self
I didn&#39;t plan that was accidentally so
but in some point in the second half of
2012 I got to this sad wave that didn&#39;t
seem to end it&#39;s not like something
major had happened from the outside
everything was great I had a nice job I
lived in a nice area I was healthy I had
no credit-card debt
so why the hell I was so sad from the
inside though he felt a little bit
different I had moved to LA maybe a
little bit more than a year ago and I
had already moved three times I was
still renting furniture and paying off
paying around two mouths by mouth it&#39;s
like I wanted to keep my options
Oh pain I didn&#39;t want to commit to
something because I didn&#39;t know what it
was gonna happen
what I didn&#39;t realize is by not wanting
any strings attached I was actually
feeling empty and by wanting total
freedom and the Liberty to just do
whatever I wanted I became a prisoner of
my own choice but if that was the only
problem right you might be asking then
why don&#39;t you just sign a lease and buy
furniture so the thing is that that was
not only the problem I felt that the
reason why I didn&#39;t want to commit right
away is because there was all these
other aspects of my life that didn&#39;t
feel quite right
first my entire family was still living
in Brazil so at least a 16 hours flight
for me to get close to them and I had
friends but if you try to make
friendships once you&#39;re ready and I do
to the working environment you&#39;ll
probably know it&#39;s not as easy as when
you&#39;re a teenager or a student and my
job is cool but I wasn&#39;t learning as
much as I guess I as I expected and I
felt I was too young to stop learning I
didn&#39;t want to feel stagnated and that
for me was frustrating so I was 26 back
then and for the first time in my life I
felt a complete mess I felt I had just
achieved everything I wanted to do and I
didn&#39;t know where to go and gym I was
really sad you know like those scenes in
the movies where the girl when sisters
in the car and there is a song in the
rage and they start crying non-stop that
was pretty much my life for a while I
felt I was gonna go back to my happy
self normally so I waited four days and
then moms and those moms became another
month and it just didn&#39;t seem to engine
but at one point I got tired I got to
this point that I just couldn&#39;t handle
any more and I realized that I had
pretty much two choices two options or I
could keep leaving feeling miserable or
I had to recomm paws myself and try to
find my own happiness again of course I
went to a psychology first because if I
was clinically depressed I wouldn&#39;t need
help but I remember she asked me first
okay so can you please
just try to describe a normal day on
your life and I&#39;m like sure I wake up at

6:30 a.m. then I go run for 6 miles if I
don&#39;t run then I was swim for an hour I
get dressed I go to work I hug my best
friend and she&#39;s like yeah I don&#39;t think
you&#39;re depressed so that&#39;s at aside I
felt okay now I&#39;m empowered now I have
what I need to pursue my happiness again
but at the same time a part of me and
I&#39;m a planning freak so I wanted to take
it seriously I felt I had a right to
just wasted so much time feeling sad I
can&#39;t make a plan just to go back to
where I was that&#39;s not a good investment
I decided that since I was gonna plan
something I wanted to plan the best year
of my life yet I didn&#39;t know what it
meant exactly but it&#39;s I liked the sound
of it 2013 is gonna be the last the the
last year I&#39;ve ever had yet so first
thing I wanted to do was try to get a
true assessment of where I was because I
had this feeling we&#39;re always looking at
the world through our own lens so maybe
I was being a little bit more harsh on
myself I was not getting the full
picture so what I did is I try to
imagine what if I saw myself walking
down the street and it wasn&#39;t me and so
I&#39;m not trying to find any flaws I&#39;m
just trying to see that person what
would I see and as I kept thinking about
it I realized that I&#39;ll probably see a
girl that was pretty doing pretty well I
would see this girl who made her own way
from a different country just finished
her master&#39;s in one of the top design
schools in the world had a job at a
multinational company that got in
without referral and she had a full set
of cluttery at home and for some reason
for me that was important to the funny
thing though is that by trying to see
myself as a third person I could see my
achievements from what they really were
I didn&#39;t have to worry about feeling
guilty of coming up as a snob or maybe
not being humble enough and I felt proud
and I started to looking at my life
through a different angle and I also
tried to find
meaning at my job because there are
different several researches that shows
that when you find things strings like
valuing what you do you&#39;re the happiest
and it has nothing to do with position
there are some doctors that struggle to
find out her value and their janitors
they are really happy because they know
that whatever they do helps the world
helps people around them to be more
productive in my case I was designing
movie covers for a free digital
entertainment channel so not saving
lives but instead of thinking of what I
was not doing I try to think about what
I was really providing what I was adding
to the world so I try to think of it in
a different perspective
I imagine this couple learning at
getting home after a long day at work
it&#39;s a hypothetical couple but they just
spent a long day working and they&#39;re
running short of money so they get home
and they want to watch a movie for free
and they&#39;re browsing the movies and by
making fun beautiful movie covers I was
actually marginally tiny lling edging
the joy and it was not much but if you
consider that we had millions of users
that marginal addition of joy added to
each other was actually quite meaningful
and once I bought my Java fruit in that
way
then I wanted to do even a better job
because I own that to that couple I
wanted to make them marginally happier
so being about my future I&#39;m thinking
about my present in that way made me
feel less anxious about my future as
well and I realized I didn&#39;t have to
pursue everything at once I could focus
on the one next time that I needed to do
for my future and I looked at it and
what was days that I was missing and I
really wanted to learn more I didn&#39;t
want to stagnate but what I didn&#39;t occur
to me until back then is that maybe
that&#39;s learning they don&#39;t have to come
from my job specifically there are there
were other ways to be challenging so
that&#39;s when I came up with the idea to
pursue my MBA I realized that I already
had a GRE that was going to expire
with you was too good UCLA offered a
part-time MBA and I could take the MBA
whilst you in my job and my company
offer free tuition reimbursement so well
it was not free but once you have part
of a tuition reimbursement and I figured
out that I had to pursue that and having
that go to look forward give me a focus
I knew I couldn&#39;t really control the
fact that I was gonna get in the NBA but
I kids to do everything under my power
to get closed so go to every Network
event go to classes show my face right
in my making nice essays and by focusing
on that that made me think less of my
problems and have something to look
forward to so now that I imagine you
where I was where I wanted to be all I
needed to do was focus on my day today
and try to make some tricks to make me
happy bringing me to my happy self and
good thing that I had just spent one
year in New York before trying to make
it New Yorkers happy so I felt I had a
good way to start I set up a five
minutes timer so every time I would wake
up and I would use that five minutes to
think about all the good things that
happened to me the day before it didn&#39;t
need to be big it could be a smile from
a stranger or ice cream but I just
wanted to think on that because I wanted
that just had my mood throughout of the
day but at the same time it didn&#39;t make
sense to just be thinking about all the
nice things that happened to me the day
before and then go to work and start
complaining because our thoughts
everything we think it creates paths in
our neurons and the more you think about
something the stronger that path becomes
and then it&#39;s easy for you to recall it
so I wanted to break that so one day I
got to work with a complaint jar and my
co-workers were like what does that mean
I&#39;m like if I say anything negative I
have to put five dollars here and then
we&#39;ll use it that money to go to happy
hours sometime so it was a win-win but I
would rather do use my money without
having to spend it on the complain
straight to the drink so I made me not
try to complain as much I also
volunteered more because
that when you do something good for
others it gives you that good vibe so I
try to feed homeless and momenta mentor
kids everything else that was gonna be
front on my way but I try to take that
initiative to people around me as well I
try to be more helpful and I try to make
more compliments more more often and I
also yes I sign a lease so I found an
apartment that I cared for and little by
little I started making that place my
home I figured since I was gonna have
the best year of my life there was no
reason to leave so might as well make
the best out of it and since I had so
many reasons to be proud of myself as
well
I felt I wasn&#39;t treating myself well
enough I started taking myself on dates
and went to my favorite restaurants
order apps entries desserts and not
shared with anyone felt a really good
and I just for fun I started leaving
some little notes for myself in my
apartment and it sounds creepy I know
but it&#39;s kind of fun to open a drawer
and see something like it smile you&#39;re
beautiful and I&#39;m like yes little by
little I start finding my happy self
again and Jim and it didn&#39;t was right
away but but I got there too the moment
I needed and it&#39;s her it took me a year
but I realized that I was already where
I wanted to be all I needed to do was to
change the way I was perceiving it when
I was a kid I read this quote and I had
never forgotten about it but I also have
never fully understood and was something
like this the secret in life is not
about chasing butterflies it&#39;s about
taking care of your garden and they will
come to you and that&#39;s exactly what
happened the moment Belva I allowed
myself to grow roots I had to take care
of it because otherwise I would rot and
as a coot evaded it and advice on it
I started attracting good things for
myself by that fall I had alright
started my MBA and I can actually just
graduated last month
Angela&#39;s an amazing experience
we&#39;d have done it all over again and by
December I had a job offer on my dream
company and it&#39;s so awesome that I&#39;m
there until now so I realize that we
can&#39;t really control things that happen
to us in life but we can always control
how we react to it the world is full of
amazing things we always have a choice
of taking it for granted or to pursue
happiness and try to see the good part
of it and I chose to have the best year
of my life and it works so well that
it&#39;s been standing since then what is
your choice
thank you
