hey everybody hey hey stop locking me
whatever my sister and I have a very
special bond we are twins twins are very
special but the question is what is a
twin hi my name is Rhys Walter and I&#39;m
Reagan Walter and our TED talk today is
about twins
most people think twins are just two
people who look alike just like and
pretty much do everything alike
that is not the case there are many
different types of twins and different
personalities we have many people ask us
ever the same person and that&#39;s not true
I mean wouldn&#39;t you be annoyed if people
came up to you and said hey you two have
the same face or aren&#39;t you two the same
person so for all of you dying to ask no
my sister and I identical twins
identical twins are mine two babies who
are on the same amniotic sac and share
the same DNA that&#39;s part of the reason
why being looking tot the same hey the
results of fraternal twins they&#39;re in
the same belly at the same time but they
each have their own amniotic sac but why
are we different what do you think it&#39;s
what is your DNA contains instructions
for making who you are they makeup your
hair and eye color
that&#39;s why identical twins look so much
alike Rison I have blue eyes and dirty
blonde hair we have the same exact DNA
but yet we aren&#39;t exactly like if you
look closely you can see differences
recess glasses because she was born with
a lazy eye and her left eye but I don&#39;t
we&#39;re gonna and I have the same exact
DNA but yet the differences come in
physical differences here&#39;s an example
when I began apple pie it always turns
out a little different the shapes of the
Apple pieces are never quite the same
maybe the stove is just the little
hotter or I add slightly more sugar even
when it&#39;s just a little bit each pious
to unique because services in the
environment make it impossible for me to
follow the instructions and exactly the
same way
so identical twins are kind of like two
pies made from the same recipe but still
turn out differently Regan and I are
also a little different because I was
born earlier than chivas yep
37 minutes apart okay I know what you&#39;re
thinking that is a really long time for
twins but that is also what makes us
have different bodies bragging is close
to two inches smaller than I am because
she was born later than I was yeah
differences can start earlier than you
might imagine this means that one twin
can start getting more to eat even
before they are born we are also a
little different because of our
personalities too I&#39;m known as the
dilly-dally ER and our family because it
because it takes me 30 minutes to put
her shirt on and Reagan is known as the
stressor if she has too much on her
plate or she forgot to do something
scientists have shown that identical
twins have various similar marks when
they are born but as they grow older
barson moody may become more more
different for a few years
Sadie&#39;s Cup compare personalities and
twins to determine when some traits are
the same like hair color so even though
identical twins have the same exact DNA
they&#39;re using it in different ways like
all other people do so many things seem
to be controlled by your DNA
this means no matter how similar to
people&#39;s DNA is they will always be
unique hey that was my part welcome to
our world
you
