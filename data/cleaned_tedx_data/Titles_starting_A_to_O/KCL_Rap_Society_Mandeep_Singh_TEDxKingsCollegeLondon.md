of em I started when I see you there
like the macho culture Michael visit
dogmas this to ever night that ask this
little advice above my casket does the
universe beside the side of my mind best
of my past it I think of Walton
appellate court said that the more
precise met the walked by seen streets
could that be porous then to understand
the unthinkable I breathe
so wraps are very constraining off and
then you the content and push you
towards avenues so here&#39;s why I felt
[Music]
[Music]
listening to the file in the rhythm with
due diligence I mind a fine beat they

five minutes in imma grab your mind so I
can chill it with an empty glass but I
can still see it women where he feels
like they&#39;re for North when I&#39;m cold or
that me warmth the fault the art yeah
the ground and lightly from a
thunderstorm approval 20 with it whose
be talking about triggers when they
because then I won&#39;t be living with a
killer obviously and I&#39;ve been living
life repetitive exercising medicine
flexing all my excellence on factors
darkest melanin exercise right there

tries to disguise what I&#39;ve seen on that
sheet lighting nervous my decides I keep
on bowling Snake Eyes in seventh we&#39;re
all playin we&#39;re all playing in Panama
papers were all pagan and not survive to
bitch it&#39;s clear to me she&#39;s on stage

overworked and underpaid man I play for
change but human nature stay the same
it&#39;s the best I can do is being a vet to
meet the Nestor day but when I told him

them owning this I&#39;m getting cozy with
my loneliness I try to box again man

British Asian tips on my constellation
for hard shoulders the weight of
expectation mid nine bits of a jar
before my immigrant parent his limitless
nothing care to their kid

as long as I live I&#39;ve lived as long as
I push if I&#39;m staying put them I&#39;m dead
I can never be good enough but I know
it&#39;s all in my head inert reception is
all we have self-deceptive this all be
glad walking tired hometowns himself the
healing more than that the what he&#39;s
doing is fat results are nothing more
than trying to find some settlement
everything on and put it down in
gorgeous rap talk to distort it the
pessimist consensus if it was forces
even better inviting Pegasus a promoting
preparing me gone

man on team what&#39;s the next bit what&#39;s
the next beat dudu along a bug up ok
cool so I&#39;m a medical student with a
real passion for psychiatry in
psychotherapy two years ago as
privileged to give a patient ten weeks
of slack of the manic psychotherapy so
one-on-one talking therapy and I wrote a
song about the first session and the
rest of it I wonder out this now I&#39;m
going to wrap the first off of this song
because the second half I&#39;m not got
mission to do so yet and it&#39;s quite
personal so just as a framework for like
thinking outside the box and you know
paying forward the privilege of the
stories you hear throughout your careers
and working life having had a foundation
of kcl to spring from this is why I&#39;m
trying to do it cool hmm starts with a
phone call this is a call from your
professor
I found the patient you&#39;ll see 15
minutes to the hour one hour in every
week use the theory of therapy at the
precipice of your minds I&#39;ll see you
about supervision for now good luck and
good bye
I feel scared of the unknown a semester
of textbooks on the mine themed fund so
I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve gone so when
willing to go Gong her my client is
coming at any minute
I know my confidence plunge so pull it
together
professional aura my medical student
mask tries to deflect all my flaws as I
walk up a corridor that stretches into
infinity I opened the door I inspect to
his greeting me he&#39;s an Indian man 510
touching 11 black design a jacket on
understated but made to measure takes
his right hand and shakes mine like he
means business he&#39;s found his child on
the thrones I&#39;m a mental conceived
different what do I offer what could I
offer a man who so put together who
knows how to stick to a plan
I should probably stick to exams
probably stick to the body my mind is
running amok tell me what could they get
from it I chat about any topic to
shackle up man your optics short walking
for the stalkers we travel up to the
office he traveled down from his job in
the city to come and meet me
poly Council cocktails with his
colleagues to come to meet me then
relief as we reach our room meeting
place for ten weeks two chairs in the
clock that ticks the deaths beat ice it
then I say cliched so tell me about
yourself where do I start
tell me the basics my name is Kay I&#39;m
the Bishop says help brown and their age
is a little bit more than yours and 27
but I want to multiply what was made
when my father came to the Shoreham so
assured lots of brag but I&#39;ve been
killing it since I was for killing it in
my exams pillaging when I played sports
I played for winning and everything
isn&#39;t my recourse but I performed when
them did anything in which I&#39;m involved
and I resolved to figure out everything
using my resolve I get so caught up in
negatives I just can&#39;t resolved it&#39;s
part it&#39;s so long ago tell me what you
recall I was 13 I said there&#39;s two no
one ever before but I was second verse
is not ethically approved yet but you
want to hear it
get the mixtape that we are sued
[Laughter]
