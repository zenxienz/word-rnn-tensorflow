wow what a pleasure to be here in
Bologna I have a secret that I&#39;d like to
share with you tonight mmm
secret of how to live a thousand lives
but first I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to say
that I&#39;ve spent about 20 years of my
life studying trust systems and it&#39;s
something that&#39;s near and dear to my
heart so I hope to take you on a journey
tonight that is worth your time let&#39;s
start with a question how many people
here I&#39;ll raise your hands actually look
around pick somebody else in the
audience around you somebody who looks
trustworthy somebody who looks
trustworthy now raise your hands if you
would allow that person to stay at home
tonight without you being there
completely unattended raise your hand
would you let that person who looks
trustworthy stay at your home raise your
hand okay
a few people now what if I told you that
that person has 20 positive reviews from
people all over the world that already
said that they are a good human and that
in the past they&#39;ve stayed at other
people&#39;s homes and it was great how many
people would now host that person in
your home a little few more maybe what
if I told you that in two years time if
you had hosted that person you may have
a new best friend
you may learn some things about yourself
in the world and it may have changed
your life
raise your hands if you might host that
person cool that&#39;s great
so here&#39;s a secret here&#39;s the secret
life is the quality of our lives are
related to transactions and
relationships primarily relationships
the more relationships we have in our
life the more life we can have but how
do you get people to connect with you
how do you get people to have
transactions and relationships with you
well you have to have trust Trust is
what determines whether people will
transact and relate to you but how do
you get trust trust is hard I mean we&#39;re
constantly building trust in our lives
constantly waiting to see if somebody is
trustworthy right that&#39;s the trick where
we&#39;re trying to we need to remove the
waiting time and then the next question
comes in well what is trust if you ask
20 different people 20 people might say
20 different things is it you know how
well you know about my needs or how
predictable I am different things to
different people
and there&#39;s even what happens when Trust
is broken I&#39;ve had my trust broken many
times in my life many times your trust
gets broken it&#39;s a small percent like
maybe the 1% that breaks your trust but
the danger is you start to recalibrate
your trust and you trust less but the
less you trust the less life you get so
the trick is how do you figure out who&#39;s
trustworthy and how do you how do you
connect those people and relate and
transact that&#39;s the key that&#39;s the key
to getting more life so my story with
trust began a long time ago in a small
town brown sylvain I was a very shy kid
but I wanted to go see the world and in
this town where I came from you could
trust anybody yeah that&#39;s a small town
and you could people everybody&#39;s trust
really a couple years later I went on a
trip to Egypt and I decided to take some
risks when I was there the tourists in
the country there were no tourists in
the country tourists had just been
murdered outside of a temple so that
curse the the the country was just empty
i defriended a taxi cab driver
me and my friend and we decided to go
around we rode camels and you know did
some of the normal things but then after
a while he invited us to go home with
his family
she may be risky but we decided okay and
we did and it was cool it was there was
a wedding happening and it was after
wedding ceremony and then we were
smoking hookah with the granddad&#39;s and
telling stories it was really cool and
then of course tuck turned to climbing
the pyramids right and they said oh you
can&#39;t do that it hasn&#39;t happened in a
long time
and pushed a little bit and then he said
well can make a call so he decided make
a call you got phony says okay well
here&#39;s the thing we got to meet this guy
at 4 a.m. in a dark alley thought to
myself hmm hmm I I could go and it could
be the experience of a lifetime or I
could go and I could never that was me
the last thing I remember or I could
stay and wonder what would have happened
for the rest of my lifetime I decided to
go I decided to trust and amazing things
happened we met that that kid in the
dark alley at 4 a.m. and he he knew the
guards he was friends with them he took
us up on to the plateau he introduced us
we made friends and they said go run
climb the pyramid whoa what I&#39;m just 19
I thought okay we rarely climb to the
top and remember sitting there around on
the edge looking out over the desert and
over geesa thinking just mind blown this
is what happens we trust dangers ok
seems good and then later that night we
were invited to go into the into the
pyramid and I was able to turn teacher
that lights off and they&#39;d slept at the
Kings sarcophagus for half-hour again
mind blown if I&#39;m just nineteen and I&#39;m
taking these risks and I&#39;m trying to use
my intuition to know who to trust and
it&#39;s working what else could I do in my
life
couple years later got my second another
lesson in trust I went to Burning Man
now Burning Man is amazing it&#39;s like
every single person there is trustworthy
everybody there is a super cooperator
it&#39;s difficult to get there there&#39;s a
filter so anybody gets there has to
cooperate has to try really hard and
when I&#39;m going around and walking around
it&#39;s like I&#39;m seeing people and above
each person&#39;s head I felt like there was
a little trust symbol floating above
their head and I would have looked
around it was like I I felt like every
single person there was trustworthy Wow
I could walk up to anyone ask for help I
need a hammer or whatever and lo and
behold people help me does that really
get started give me this idea how could
a website online show who&#39;s trustworthy
and make it so that everybody is
trustworthy and I started to wonder what
the value of trust is and I researched
turns out that 25% of our world&#39;s GDP
she just might be locked up in trust and
control infrastructure what does that
mean think of countries like Scandinavia
Scandinavia there&#39;s a lot of trust
Scandinavia doesn&#39;t need bars on their
windows and they don&#39;t need lawyers they
have trust so they get a boost to their
GDP but countries maybe like Brazil in
other countries well if there&#39;s less
trust you need more lawyers
you need more bars near ones that&#39;s
control infrastructure when you need
control infrastructure it&#39;s a drain on
your economy and your GDP goes down
interesting so there&#39;s clearly some
valuev trust a couple years later I went
to Iceland another lesson I decided that
I was going to spam a bunch of
university students I&#39;d hacked into the
University of Iceland student directory
extracted 1,500 names and emails and I
constructed a mail spam saying dear
Bjorn
I&#39;m coming to Iceland could I stay with
you and between fifty and a hundred
people said yes come stay and keep in
mind I&#39;m a very shy person so when was
this this model invited me to go stay
with her and her friends and I followed
her and her friends around just like all
weekend like whoa that was mind-blowing
for me and it got me out of my comfort
zone it was like super super
uncomfortable for me to put myself in a
situation like that but it helped me
grow and it helped me learn about myself
and I left Iceland on that bear plane I
remember just remember sitting there
over exactly where wasn&#39;t the place I
said I want to travel like this every
time and couchsurfing was born
couchsurfing was born and I started
getting to work on it
Iceland was like an MVP in Iceland I
sent that email in the email I said this
is why I&#39;m trustworthy would you trust
me pictures philosophy and people said
yes I don&#39;t know you but I will trust
you because you have trust indicators
and that&#39;s what couchsurfing is about I
knew how it needed to work so I got to
work and couchsurfing started to grow
and no longer would I need to be a ghost
walking around Europe looking at statues
taking a picture and going home and then
another
than happened the lesson of transferable
trust once in couchsurfing once people
started to build trust over here and
then use it over there they started to
experience what transferable Trust is
about life and relationships and
transactions accelerate here&#39;s Emily
Emily sends a message to someone saying
I&#39;d like to stay at your house
can I stay gets the response back I&#39;m
sorry I&#39;m not home right now but since
you have 20 positive references and you
look really cool go ahead the keys in
the garden I&#39;ll see you in two days have
fun right Emily&#39;s life just got
accelerated that transaction just got
accelerated Emily just got more life
it&#39;s pretty powerful and that&#39;s what
couchsurfing is about couchsurfing
started to grow like wildfire people
caught got to it we&#39;ve gotten to
instantly transact and relate to people
around the world we don&#39;t know and our
lives are enhanced and a lot of us have
felt like wow wouldn&#39;t it be so great if
we could do this outside of couchsurfing
that would be so cool couchsurfing
became perhaps the world&#39;s largest trust
experiment of all time I learned a lot
over those years of running couchsurfing
about ten years and what I learned was
that the world is a good place when when
you want when people want to trust each
other and when you want to go somewhere
and you want to get off a plane you&#39;re
wondering will you be okay you will be
couchsurfers feel that everyday get off
a plane I feel safe the world is a good
place people ask me well how did you
build couchsurfing I mean that&#39;s really
cool you&#39;ve got this this organization
this network but how did you get people
from all over the world to work together
and build this scalable thing it grew
like exponentially around the world well
here&#39;s how I think we did it if you
research there&#39;s different types of
organizations if you could have a super
cooperation organization that
organizations gonna do pretty well but
if you have an organization like on the
left side of this chart that the feeling
in the organization is life sucks
people are just surviving how can you
get any work done when people are just
surviving see that one certainly doesn&#39;t
work now let&#39;s take them look at the
middle chart that ones where most of the
world is at fifty percent or so the
feeling is I&#39;m great and you&#39;re not it&#39;s
where people are
on to information information is power
and people give out information to
maximize their power now everybody in
the organization has a different idea
idea of what is real
you can&#39;t distribute decision-making and
you can&#39;t scale that organization now
take a look at the organization on the
right that organization feels like we
are great information is shared
completely anybody could probably make
it an ok decision in across the
organization wide everybody has a
complete picture of reality that is a
super cooperation that is a that is
something that can scale but then when
you dig down a little bit a little bit
further you get two teams now at the
team level you&#39;ve got people that
operate different ways you&#39;ve got givers
matchers and takers generally speaking
there&#39;s more to it but that&#39;s the
simplified model givers if you have any
amount of givers on a team that seems
gonna do very well there&#39;s going to give
and help each other out if you get
matters well they&#39;re just making sure
that everything&#39;s equal your economy of
getting things done slows down a bit but
still you can get there it&#39;s ok but any
amount of takers destroys the whole
thing things get weird people slow down
things get unpredictable it doesn&#39;t move
forward what will the future be what
will the future be when it comes to
trust some people in the world they
think that we are going to have a single
dimension of trust in the future for
each person or maybe a few dimensions of
trust some people think that a trust
score is gonna be worth more than money
I think so
I think that a universal trust system is
inevitable it&#39;s coming we&#39;re starting to
see signs of it no we&#39;re not all seeing
signs of it certain people in certain
places in the world are seeing signs of
this but it&#39;s something to pay attention
to so I want to share this with you so
you can start to have a lens in which to
look into the future first you got to
understand what siloed Trust is we all
know about siloed trust silo trust that
is websites and trust systems and
reputation systems we use every day
couchsurfing you you build up a
reputation with a bunch of reviews
they&#39;re great you can&#39;t take that
reputation and those reviews over to
Yelp you can&#39;t take it over eBay that
doesn&#39;t work it works within
a silo now Universal trust what is
University Universal Trust is when you
can take your reputation from one system
and go use it somewhere else and maybe
somewhere else and collected here and
use it there it&#39;s a hard problem to
solve but it&#39;s starting to be solved in
fact the closest version we have in the
United States now is something called
FICO it&#39;s a credit score assistance
banks use it to determine whether you
should get a loan if you have a good
score you could get a loan get a better
look bigger loan something but now
people are using it for not just giving
loans let&#39;s say you were considering
someone as a roommate someone you till
maybe live with you might look at their
FICO score to determine if they&#39;re gonna
be a good roommate are they gonna clean
up the dishes well let me look at your
FICO score kind of interesting right
it&#39;s kind of apples and oranges but
that&#39;s the best system that&#39;s available
I&#39;ve been spending the last couple years
working on this project I&#39;ll wonder
which we don&#39;t want to reduce people to
any just one dimension it&#39;s like what
are your personal dimensions
professional dimensions and other
dimensions our belief is that you don&#39;t
want to reduce people to one number
nobody wants to be one number
we&#39;re human right humans don&#39;t want to
be one number I don&#39;t want to be
whenever now I should talk a little bit
about some dystopian systems for those
of you who aren&#39;t sure what that word
means
a utopian system would be a good future
a system in a good future or a good
system in the future now a dystopian
system is maybe a bad system in the
future so when we don&#39;t want the future
to look like recently a black mirror
portrayed one of these dystopian futures
everybody was reduced to a single credit
score or social credit score and you
couldn&#39;t get you couldn&#39;t rent a car you
couldn&#39;t do all kinds of things you
couldn&#39;t hang out with cool people you
couldn&#39;t get a certain home if you
didn&#39;t have a good enough score China&#39;s
doing this now reduces people to one&#39;s
one dimension it&#39;s if you don&#39;t have a
good enough score you can&#39;t travel you
can&#39;t maybe get alone and maybe
sometimes that those dimensions are
based on who your political party is I
mean there&#39;s all kinds of ways where it
can look like a system that helps
support us it&#39;s to thrive as humans or
kind of control us
right so I asked you all to close your
eyes bear with me just close your eyes
imagine think for a second imagine it&#39;s
five years from now you&#39;re gonna wake up
and wake up five years from now what&#39;s
it going to be like trust systems all of
these reputation systems they&#39;re going
to be bigger they gotta be sewn into our
lives more and more and more and you&#39;re
gonna be either happy or unhappy about
that day going forward I think are you
gonna experience a system that treats
you like a human that is diverse
celebrates your diversity that you&#39;re
kind of in control and you can become
the best person you want to be and have
a really great life something you&#39;re
inspired to goal of your day or is it
going to be a system of control is it
going to be a system that doesn&#39;t honor
your diversity but tries to make you
into a single perfect person there&#39;s a
big questions but the future isn&#39;t
written yet so it&#39;s really it&#39;s really
up to all of us
to think about this and it&#39;s up to us to
choose thank you
[Applause]
you
