why is my doctor wasting precious
minutes of our very short time together
typing into her computer when she should
be talking to me it must be very
important so I assume that&#39;s data about
me makes sense but I wonder where where
is that data going is it is it going
into the hard drive they were in her
office is it is it forward to some
server and medical system that she&#39;s
working for
or is it residing in some cloud overhead
somewhere is the government looking at
my data and and if so what Dad is it
looking at but what does it want to do
with it I&#39;ll come clean I&#39;m an emergency
physician and I&#39;m teaching graduate
students now how to use technology and
medical data to get us to the point
where we have optimal health outcomes
that&#39;s really been very important to me
because I&#39;m unsatisfied with how we&#39;re
leveraging technology and data today to
achieve just that incredibly expensive
technology that we are using should be
helping us to arrive with our doctors at
health plans and health journeys that
take us to the best health we can have
throughout our entire lives that takes
technology and data to optimize that but
we&#39;re not really using it well we each
have data strewn around the world
depending on where we stopped for
medical care in hospitals emergency
departments ergy centers places while we
were away on vacation but to those
islands of data merge in any way to make
more sense out of out of our medical
condition does your doctor have access
to those other pieces of data the answer
of that is mostly no and in fact I you
know that the data is is huge in those
islands and I believe it&#39;s important
because I have to because I received the
wonderful little pages after I have a
medical encounter that tell me they&#39;re
explaining my benefits to me that takes
a lot of data to fill those sheets I&#39;m
indebted and to one of the mentors I had
in medical school for explaining to me
how technology actually can help the
physician patient relationship and and
that was over 40 years ago today that
Steve Jobs had just left his garage hey
this was not high tech when I used to
participate in the care of his patients
he showed me that data capture and
transparency were all concepts that
could be worked into strengthening the
physician patient relationship I would
watch him as he would sit beside his
patients do a brief history and physical
exam hold their arm and discuss with
them what he found and what they should
do about it and discuss that and when
they were through he would reach into
his pocket and pull out a portable
cassette tape recorder that was
high-tech and he would dictate the
office visit note in front of the
patients and be able to dictate letters
to the physicians who referred the
patient and any family members who were
involved in the care the patient knew
exactly what this doctor knew about them
understood about them was saying about
them to the outside world and it really
strengthened their relationship his
patients loved him but it really didn&#39;t
take any more time out of his office
visit and this is 40 years ago my doctor
says she&#39;s stressed by typing all his
data into her computer and she&#39;s as
stressed as I am and she says that this
is not helping care for me in the few
minutes she has to see me in my regular
office visits is this is the technology
we&#39;re currently using and the data we
currently correct really helping us to
get better medical care have we gotten
anything beyond what my mentor was able
to do 40 years ago well the answer is
yes
but it&#39;s yes but it&#39;s it hasn&#39;t been
able to free the doctor to spend more
time with us it hasn&#39;t given the doctor
as much information as she needs to make
a really best diagnosis and best
treatment plan for me the odds of
getting the best care available right
now on your visit to your doctor are
extraordinarily low the information is
not there there&#39;s some good news I mean
there is an opportunity to take a real
leap forward right now for a couple of
thousand years doctors have been trying
to remember everything about you while
they&#39;re talking to you and making up a
treatment plan it&#39;s not an easy task I
can tell you because we get tired and we
forget stuff and there are 25 more
patients in the waiting room to be seen
this isn&#39;t a guarantee that you&#39;re going
to get perfect knowledge impacting what
your plan is for your treatment this is
not the optimal situation but computers
don&#39;t get tired computers remember all
this stuff and they can help the doctor
do that that&#39;s really very important
that it&#39;s it&#39;s happening a bit today
when you&#39;re in the hospital and you need
medication your nurse has to interact
with a computer system before he can
give you the meds or push the syringe
it&#39;s a beautiful dance the nurse asks
you questions like your name and your
birth date to make sure that you&#39;re the
patient who&#39;s on your Hospital ID band
and then a scan has the computer checked
to see that the person that is this ID
band wants the medications that are on
the tray by scanning their package this
is a revolution in medical care because
only 20 years ago we were making medical
errors in hospitals at a rate that
exceeded five to ten percent of the time
you didn&#39;t get your right medications at
the right dose at the right time so
computers have truly moved us on
toward eliminating though isn&#39;t giving
confidence especially to me if I&#39;m in
that situation I&#39;m confident that I&#39;m
getting the right medicine and I&#39;m
getting a medicine that my doctor
prescribed for me and I&#39;m getting a
medicine that&#39;s compatible with me
that&#39;s very important in terms of my
care because I&#39;m still not sure with
that computer help whether I&#39;m getting
the best care for my condition I&#39;m not
sure that the procedure that he wants to
book for me next week is the right
procedure for my condition because there
is an incredible amount of medical
knowledge and doctors can&#39;t keep up with
it at this point one new medical article
is being published every minute of every
day that&#39;s impossible to keep up with my
doctor is lucky if she can get to an
annual medical conference and hear a
couple of talks on a couple of things
that might be relevant to me but that&#39;s
not anywhere near the kinds of
information that needs to be available
for her to be able to plan my very best
treatment there&#39;s an incredible amount
of data that we could be using because
the truth is we all visit the doctor 1
billion times a year in this country
that&#39;s a lot of data that could be used
to research medical conditions and
medical outcomes and medical therapy
results that we&#39;re not doing as we speak
we could there are tools out there that
can do this most of you are aware of
Watson the medic computer that won on
Jeopardy a few years ago Watson
continues to get stronger and has many
cousins as well but Watson can read all
of those medical articles Watson
understands them Watson can also
correlate my symptoms and whatever the
doctor has found with all of the
diagnoses that go with that and give my
doctor a list of diagnoses for me that
need to be considered and recommended
and it can give treatment plans for all
of those all of those illnesses or
that&#39;s that&#39;s an amazing improvement
/ what we&#39;re doing today so why isn&#39;t it
being done well
Watson&#39;s a little complicated and a
little expensive for my doctor to
contract for on their own just to take
better care of me even though I&#39;d like
that okay it&#39;s a very expensive deal
it&#39;s hard it&#39;s outside of the electronic
medical record it&#39;s another thing to do
for her and it&#39;s way too complicated way
too expensive there are apps for
everything
there should be apps running in the
background that do all this today
because the electronic medical system is
there it should be running in the
background to do things that should help
the doctor why is she still typing this
doesn&#39;t make sense
well it does in a way because our
Hospital electronic medical record
systems were built on the backs of
billing systems they are very very good
at identifying everything that was done
to you and putting it together in a
package that can be sent as a bill to
the insurer that&#39;s what they&#39;re really
good at it they&#39;re not very good at
optimizing clinical care that isn&#39;t
their job they can track absolutely what
drug you get but if I have any piece of
medical data it might be in one of up to
20 or 30 different places in the medical
record making it very difficult to be
able to search and do things effectively
to try to get my care to be better and
more up-to-date not only that but my
doctor has to look at screens that are
very complicated for her and she&#39;s not
that kind of visual person and those
screens were very likely the favorite
icons and the favorite widgets that the
engineer who put the system together not
a physician not anybody who understood
the content material that&#39;s really a
problem for us and then we have some
things that are really putting us at the
cusp of a change voice recognition is
exceeding 99% these days voice
recognition is part of our lives whether
we like it or not but those
conversations that I&#39;m having with my
doctor
in the office can be converted to data
and the computer can write the office
note the computer can write can write
the correspondence the computer can give
Watson my symptoms and what&#39;s going on
with me and have Watson advise the
doctor recommend what my diagnosis is
what my treatment really ought to be and
it can do it on the basis of today&#39;s
medical articles huge difference and
it&#39;s not that far off your your
smartphone and or your little device at
home that plays music for you when you
talk is really all it&#39;s needed to
monitor me while I&#39;m in the exam room
with my doctor and I can get those
results
it needs innovative education and a new
curriculum we need folks who understand
medicine who understand computer
technology who understand human
cognition and understand how to get
things done in medical organizations
that&#39;s a tall order but people are
already approaching this there are
physicians and nurses and even office
managers who are going back to school
you know they&#39;re learning about data
capture and they&#39;re learning about
strengths and weaknesses of analytic
analyses they&#39;re learning about
artificial intelligence and natural
language processing that should be there
to help the doctor take care of us they
speak both technology and medicine so
this marriage of disciplines called
healthcare informatics is really able to
deliver on the promise that technology
and medicine had together of delivering
optimal health care for each of us we&#39;re
there almost in terms of the technology
the Internet of Things is here that&#39;s
all those Wi-Fi and Bluetooth things
that talk to the net that are hanging
around us and or a person or home or our
cars there are devices today that are
interesting bathroom scale can not only
weigh you and print out a graph of how
your weights go on that&#39;s depressing
but could call your doctor and let him
know face your doctors monitoring your
weight because he&#39;s worried about rapid
fluid retention and congestive heart
failure or some other major condition
that could be intervened early and keep
you out of the hospital that&#39;s here
today there&#39;s a refrigerator for sale
this year that scans the barcodes on
your food and knows what you have in
your fridge and knows what you&#39;re eating
so today what do we use it for we make a
shopping list when your food gets low
it&#39;s less than optimal health okay
there&#39;s only just so many Twinkies you
can scan but it is capable of doing
things like letting your doctor know
that you&#39;re drinking a lot of grapefruit
juice and that could be the reason for
your bad cholesterol level because
grapefruit juice interferes with the
absorption of anti cholesterol medicine
would you have known to tell the doctor
you&#39;re drinking a lot of grapefruit
juice not necessarily but the
refrigerator knew the refrigerator could
help us well why doctor knows that I
take my medications because my pill
container knows the weight of every one
of my medicines and it knows when I
opened the door and took out exactly
that weight of medicine what time I did
it so it can tell my doctor that I&#39;m
complying with the treatment regimen I
took them at the right times the right
day is the right medicines Wow you know
that&#39;s amazing for folks and of course
it could call me or text me or do
anything it wants if I didn&#39;t and tell
me that I&#39;m overdue for my medicines
it&#39;s a great help for folks who are of
course a few years older than I am who
have trouble with their memory what I am
worried about is my dental floss
container telling my dentist that I
really don&#39;t floss as much as I tell
so what benefits are there from this
what does this look like there&#39;s a
medical exam room behind me a patient
comes in following up for a biopsy of a
hard lump that she had a few days ago
and wants to find out what it was and if
anything needs to be done about it and
she puts on her Johnny still embarrassed
by the lack of coverage and sits on the
exam table and our technician comes in
and puts a small box on her arm that
painlessly gets her respirations and her
oxygen and her pulse and her blood
pressure and her chemistry&#39;s from her
blood and the doctor that wirelessly
transfers to the computer and the doctor
comes in and greets her it goes over her
exam for that day and then tells her he
wishes he had better news he shows her
on his tablet what today is he swipes to
the pathology report and goes over it
with her then they both sit quietly for
a minute while she sobs and he reaches
for the Kleenex box he explains what the
latest protocols are from the National
Institutes of Health for her problem
that Watson found for based on her labs
her tumor and her exact genetic makeup
he also showed the results of current
treatments been able to have a full
discussion about what she should do next
when she says that she&#39;s way too
overwhelmed he asked her if she wants to
be seen in a few days and with a single
tap sends an encrypted message to her
home full of hyperlinks to the articles
and makes this appointment for her in a
few days to come back he asked her on
the way out the door if she&#39;s ready yet
for him to talk to her partner but she
reassures her that he is going to stand
by her through this entire treatment
course no matter what
what do we need to do to reach this this
is about using our legislation to drive
the incorporation of hi-tech into
medical care this is about having our
legislators used that the billions of
federal dollars we spent in the last
decade to put a computer in every office
in every hospital to be able to have
these benefits but it&#39;ll take our help
they will not think of it unless they
hear our voices we need to say that
optimal health outcomes should be the
object of any system they really want to
build and that hi-tech integration is
the way that we&#39;re going to get the best
medical care we&#39;re going to get optimal
medical care in the future our doctor
will have assistance with all the
diagnosis and treatment but they&#39;ll have
more time to be with us in the exam room
and isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re all hoping for
thank you
[Applause]
