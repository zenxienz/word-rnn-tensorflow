Berman is growing and it&#39;s growing in so
many ways over the last five years the
city economy is growing by almost 20
percent so the fact that it&#39;s now worth
25 billion pounds a year we now get
thirty three and a half million people
visiting the city every year and our
population is growing a population
that&#39;s famously young we&#39;re fifty two
percent of the population are under the
age of 35 and we have a big city plan a
plan to grow even more a plan to be one
of the best cities in the world by 2030
and when you add all these things
together the money starts flooding in 1
billion pounds is the budget for the
redevelopment of the wholesale markets
into what&#39;s to come Smithfield that&#39;s
1000 million pounds for one development
and these are always the big numbers we
get pushed around the headlines that we
get told about but we never get any
insight from any of this data because
you don&#39;t get insight from data you only
get the insights when you start to
question it to look at what that context
is and to understand where that data is
coming from and who&#39;s telling you what
that data is
because in Birmingham amongst this great
big city plan we still got some issues
we&#39;re a city with the second highest
level of unemployment across all core
cities the situation is even worse for
our famous young population we&#39;re a city
where 50 50 percent of the under-17s
live in neighborhoods which are regarded
as some as the most deprived areas in
the country
and we&#39;re still a city where one in
three children grow up in poverty but
it&#39;s not just an economic deficit we
have it&#39;s a health deficit - we&#39;re a
city where if you&#39;re born in shard end
your life expectancy is a whole decade
shorter than somebody else born in
Sutton Coldfield and we have a
democratic deficit to a recent study by
the City Council showed that only 7% of
residents felt they had any involvement
in local decision-making and yet where
the city of Cadbury one of the companies
that radically change what it was like
to be an employer who physically built
communities for their workers to allow
them to thrive and to really consider
their health and well-being were a City
of Austin and later the rover group who
built housing and physical communities
so that our employees knew that having a
job was more than just going to work
but these great institutions leave
legacies to the legacy of looking for
our big companies to do looking for the
big companies to be the ones that
provide the answers becoming consumers
not just of their products but consumers
of their way of life - and we&#39;re a
product of our other institutions -
Herbert Manzoni
one of Birmingham&#39;s not so famous
children he was the city architect and
planner in the post-war years he saw
Birmingham as a blank canvas and he saw
the post-war years as his mission to
redevelop the city he was a fan of
concrete and motorcars
and he built great big highways and
great tall tower blocks and he wasn&#39;t
really a fan of heritage
or people he just saw them as things to
get in the way of his vision and as we
go into a whole new redevelopment phase
his mentality of knock it down and start
again still prevails because we&#39;re going
through a redevelopment we&#39;ve never seen
the scale of since the post-war years
and our legacy still looks for the
council to do much of this redevelopment
where consumers of their vision rather
than producers of our own city but
they&#39;re just making up for the housing
market within this country we need
250,000 homes a year to be built and yet
in most years if we&#39;re lucky we build
135,000 and half of those are built by
just ten companies the fact of the
matter is the housing market isn&#39;t going
to work
it can&#39;t work because it&#39;s not in their
strategic interests to make it work one
of the leading house builders in the
country puts this in their annual
statement we have grown completion
volumes in a disciplined way I don&#39;t
want to grow too quickly because it&#39;s
not in their interests but their
interests often have unintended
consequences like the 1.8 million people
living in the country on housing waiting
lists 120,000 children sleeping in
insecure overnight accommodation but the
fact is it&#39;s not just as simple as
building more houses the housing crisis
we have is a complex mess you can&#39;t just
build your way out of it and some extent
that makes us feel powerless the
complexity feels difficult to deal with
we don&#39;t really know what to do and when
you add in the legacy of being built for
by the big companies or the big public
sector that makes that powerlessness
even harder to over
but sometimes the most powerful thing
you can do is to start asking questions
to start being curious so that&#39;s what I
did
I wanted to look at our city and to find
out not where but the big opportunities
were but where the small opportunities
were where were the places we could do
something different and this is what I
found it&#39;s over 66 hectares of land
owned by the City Council that&#39;s
completely empty and what you can see
from that is there&#39;s no big bits really
there&#39;s nothing big and juicy that are
developing and go on and build their
houses and disappear on so these bits
are land they&#39;re going to need new ways
of working the old profit modal isn&#39;t
going to work here
models like wiki house which is an open
source platform a digitally produced and
digitally fabricated building system for
houses a system to radically lower the
barriers to self build a system which
means you can locally print your house
around the corner and build it with your
friends just powered by tea and cake and
it&#39;s based on the community of
architects designers builders
fabricators around the world who are
each testing tampering changing and
making the model better working towards
a collective aim rather than individual
profit and I know this worked because we
built one on the back of our house but
individual houses aren&#39;t going to solve
this crisis we&#39;ve got to start looking
at the way that we build our communities
two models like cooperative housing
mutually owned home ownerships
and community land Trust&#39;s that are
spreading across the country the models
of development which fundamentally bake
in affordability into the model and it&#39;s
real affordability affordability linked
to local earnings rather than inflated
market prices and leads of taking this
one step further there people Howard
homes revolution has raised over three
hundred and fifty thousand pounds from
thousands of people across the city
investing their own money into the
benefit of building community LED
housing showing it&#39;s not just the people
who buy the houses and live in the
houses that can benefit from it and this
idea of collective wealth building
housing is nothing new really this totem
stands in the shadow of one of the
biggest commercial developments within
the city and it&#39;s probably walk past
hundreds of times a day when people
actually not really knowing what it says
on it or even really caring for what
this marks is a really important moment
for the whole of the financial
institutions across the world because
this is the site of a former pub where a
group of working people got together and
decided that they weren&#39;t gonna stand
for the current housing system they
wanted to put their money together to
collectively buy land and build houses
for each other this was the start of the
building sightsee revolution and it
started here in Birmingham this is an
Enlightenment era idea this may be ready
for 21st century comeback because we&#39;re
starting to forget this idea a peak we
had over a thousand building societies
in the country societies which used
individuals money collected it together
and built housing for everyone mr.
Windell czar just 44
so whereas in the 19th century we looked
at the philanthropists and the
industrialists to make up for the
shortfall in the housing market and in
the 20th century we look to the public
sector to do this for us I believe in
the 21st century we can create a new
sector the citizen sector that looks to
basically redevelop the whole model that
puts mutuality and collective benefit
ahead of individual benefit in the
housing markets Berman is on the brink
of a new dawn and if we&#39;re going to get
it right it&#39;s going to take all of us to
get involved this time thank you
