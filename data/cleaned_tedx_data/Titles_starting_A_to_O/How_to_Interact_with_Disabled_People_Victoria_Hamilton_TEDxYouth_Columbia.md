3d idolaters this cool
it&#39;s adopted for you why don&#39;t you look
at some little community colleges this
well engineer but hurtful words were
welcomed by my high school guidance
counselor one fall day of my senior year
she&#39;s on my dream so the college ecology
was unattainable because I was diagnosed
with my own cell body at the 8&#39;s away
she did not know that this was my dream
so since the eighth attempt when I
proclaimed to my parents on a syllabic
tribe this will I&#39;m coming one day my
heart header for when she been seeing
some local community colleges will they
go for it but none a Julie cover for me
she&#39;s her I taught it received so far
from home recently I was doing a project
and a longing for tisha stood out to me
thirteen point seven percent of people
with disabilities graduate from college
comparative fifty percent of the general
college population while Odessa tested
in solo it&#39;s not surprising people with
disabilities get discriminated against
for one in higher education like I once
was in high school to change they&#39;re so
gentle
we need the word on an individual level
and ourselves I introduced you know
rather as individuals

time as I said to each other just do it
him were people I&#39;ll say actively
listening you may not realize that today
but you are actively listening to me
speak I mean is control training

remembering what is being told was a
passive it may take a little time but
you are fully getting my message
if you don&#39;t understand Sunday a
disabled person says just ask them to
repeat their to give you example of
active listening was a passive words
only when my puppet is the response I
Devin I asked about the weather
sometimes I bet it&#39;s sunny or rainy and
I don&#39;t have okay don&#39;t Hall is wet I
gave a bully
I really don&#39;t tell I love the color of
your car and how they use it there from
what I will try it to say if you do a
new science are they a disabled person

will be happy too I&#39;ll tell the times of
uni are still we want to be understood

mental retardation and autism have a
half of the shoes and then Theresa does

lower intelligence
aware Italian wrote
everyone is a genius but if you judge a
fish by its ability to climb a tree it
was when whole life thinking it&#39;s stupid

a proposer reach out to each other and
encourage each other to do more a better
even to alert with amazing assumptions
of one&#39;s ability to illustrate this by
I&#39;m never to give you example of one
individual who acceded the advertiser or
Jamis okay also has sail above party and
was on the hit TV show Breaking Bad
he tells of course he wasn&#39;t taken
seriously because he had a disability
but one passing age a given the chance I
casted him as what regime or the son of
the service protagonist all day one of
the many faces devote a day will see me
day I take today disabilities advertised
Ellis generals once said really unique
mind to figure out come has problems but
in order to do that we need to change
the environment see it&#39;s right we need
those unique minds to right up to
