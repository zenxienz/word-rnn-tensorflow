different accents and bear with it you
know life is a curious thing and
sometimes I wonder if I&#39;ll ever get the
habit I wonder if there are actually
anything if there&#39;s actually anything
certain in this world other than the
typical death and taxes but after
thinking about it I would like to
suggest two things of which I am certain
one every perfect person was born or the
person of purpose and a passion let me
say that again every person was born
with a purpose and a passion and to
every person was born for human
connection I believe that the world
changers the visionaries the influencers
they are people that understand this the
purpose of life is to live a life of
purpose about ten years ago my husband
asked me a question he said you could do
anything what would you do now that
seems like a simple question but it&#39;s
actually really complex it&#39;s the
question that helps us to understand our
purpose and our passion in life and when
you combine your purpose in your passion
the sky is the limit because people with
great passion can make the impossible
possible I only needed a few seconds to
answer that question I told them I would
love to direct Broadway musicals and
after a short conversation and a few
days about compelled to write down a
specific plan for this impossible dream
a theatre performing arts group for
teenagers now I know some of you are
wondering is she crazy and I&#39;m not sure
if the craziness comes in with creating
a theatre performing arts group or the
fact that I wanted to work with
teenagers but I remember being
a teenager I remember that awkward stage
and wise rod is convinced that no one
would ever understand me or my dreams
it&#39;s a stage in life where your desire
for human connection is at its highest
and your understanding and purpose in
life is at its lowest and that
description I believe it&#39;s still true of
teenagers today
hence my dream became a reality now the
description of what I believed for today
a place for people to create connections
that it was called Nexus Nexus actually
means connecting point and from the very
beginning we were very clear on our
vision creating connections building
community nurturing creativity and
producing excellence and I want to use
those four things today to encourage you
and how to build Purpose Driven
connections
the first idea creating connections has
to be first people need to know that
they belong brynbrown once said
connection is the energy that&#39;s created
between people when they feel seen
valued and heard and this is so true so
from the very beginning
Nexus created a mantra for its family
once an EXO nyan and they would yell out
always an EXO Nene we had a young lady
that showed up came back to mixes after
graduating and she came back to help
with our latest production and the
Phantom of the Opera and I remember the
joy on her face when she walked into the
room oh you know what&#39;s in it
and everybody held out always the next
onion followed by a dog pile of hubs
because that&#39;s what happens at Nexus she
hadn&#39;t forgotten the power of belonging
you know human connections so often
gives us value in life to feel connected
is to feel that you belong the second
idea building community merge
beautifully with creating connections
you know we need to listen to this
statement as Australia&#39;s an around world
it takes a village to raise a child we
live in a world today where we are so
isolated we drive into our garage we
shut the door and we shut out the world
and when we do that we lose the value of
the people around us and unfortunately
this reality creates a bad reality
because people need to build community
they need us to model to them that as
they give back they actually become
better versions of themselves I want to
read you a small excerpt from the letter
that we received in Nexus from a parent
about her son and about building
community my son joined his family a
supportive and nurturing group of
encouraging and accepting individuals
whose goals in life were to lift you up
lead you further and bring out the best
in you over the following five years my
son instead seen that he can go far he
can share his ideas youth to others and
have a whole lot of fun along the way
here&#39;s a place where the individual is
given the space to shine and give it the
opportunity to develop in a happy and
nurturing and fire
everyone is made to feel secure and
confident in who they are the journey
that preparing and rehearsing his gives
time for performers to stretch their
imagination to find ways to express
themselves they never dreamed it
possible and to start to become the
fantastic individuals that they are
I hope those who say that that you feel
inspired to find something in which you
are passionate about and through that
create a place where you can create
connections for other people the third
concept near true creativity is it an
amazing way for people to find their
passions although next to started out as
a place for people who loved the arts
the Performing Arts in particular it
didn&#39;t stay that way we have an entirely
eclectic group of people from all walks
of life
we have mainstream marginalized disabled
young old talented not so talented but
that&#39;s okay as we all belong we have
those that can make a monotone joyful
noise we also have those that are
blowing away their voices we have
artists that paint like Monet I am NOT
one of them we have people who love to
express themselves through preparing
food and loving giving to others you
know teenagers that keep your heart
incident we know and you&#39;re never too
old we have a Nexus Graham who&#39;s an
invaluable part of our community and she
offers love and wisdom to kids around
them that don&#39;t have grandparents in the
area or just don&#39;t
grandparents and their relationships
with them and we have people who express
themselves through Disney songs and show
tunes we have lots of those and you know
Nexus is around when you hear in the
background to show to millions of them
being sung in multiple parts of harmony
mind you if you ever come visit Nexus do
not ever say the words were all in this
together or someone will sing the entire
high school musical performance to you
and it will drive you nuts and what we
have the performers we have the safety
people the people who build SATs good
thank you for that note hammers are not
for everyone
we are all connected to each other in a
circle sorry we are all connected to
each other and we need to create safe
places that desire to bring forward the
creativity each individual conferring
and the result will be this people will
discover their passions because they&#39;re
free to dream and I&#39;ve read this
somewhere passion is the genesis of
Jesus isn&#39;t that beautiful
and that&#39;s where the fourth concept
comes in producing excellence when
everyone is invested everyone gives
their best and when you measure success
through connections and community and
not productivity and output the result
often looks like this people bring their
best and excellence is achieved because
your measure of success is placed in the
most important place people my favorite
moment that Nexus is at the end of the
production we all gather together and
have this big reflection box and we pass
around a bowl get up everyone loves it
was don&#39;t think and each person takes
out a skittle and removes this pill and
says how the color of that skill
represents something they loved about
their
journey in Nexus so one year were going
around takes forever it&#39;s an emotional
time it&#39;s awesome but this one really
quiet shy boy holds up his skin and he
says I sucked the color off my skittle
so it would be what white was the color
of purity and to me Nexus is pure I love
it here I&#39;ve often thought about that
statement purity was strange word to use
in today&#39;s age but you know what I&#39;ve
thought about it and what I think he
meant was this it is so different here
this is a unique place where people
don&#39;t look at the best song the best
performance the best actor instead it
looks like the best an individual can
dream that&#39;s what mattered human he is
the one that mattered people an
eight-way desire to belong that&#39;s what
they wanted was and when they feel the
value of connection and belonging they
will become who they truly are and
really creating environments like that
they will breathe perpetual results they
will ask you to do the same thing for
someone else we need to create places
where people feel free to ask themselves
the question mile has
asked me 10 years ago if you could do
anything what would you do you see if
everyone was born with a purpose and a
passion and for community are we
creating places for people to find and
develop that purpose are we telling you
people that discovering their passion
will help to define them are we modeling
connections that allow the next
generation to discover and cultivate who
they are and who they will become
Marianne Williamson said one of my
favorite quotes ever our greatest fear
is not that we are inadequate our
greatest fear is that we are powerful
beyond measure she understood the idea
that we have it within us to be great we
need to move beyond the mundane and seek
out our purpose and our passion the one
that makes us powerful beyond measure
Nexus is the fulfillment of that joy for
me I do love it it breathes life into me
I am so passionate I think you can tell
about it it brings me joy a simple dream
turned from my intrinsic satisfaction to
something that brings connection and
community to us a safe place for people
to discover who they are and if you&#39;re
someone that&#39;s asking today or thinking
how do I just
my purpose a lot of gave us idea to you
from TD jakes if you can&#39;t figure out
your purpose figure out your passion or
your passion will lead you right into
your dream find a safe place where you
can begin to explore the things you love
be fearless and courageous in the
pursuit of the things that set your soul
on fire and help you to dream big and
create connections with others now
that&#39;s an idea or this thank you
