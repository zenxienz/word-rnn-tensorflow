before I started making pictures
the only photographs I saw were of
landmarks these were images of birthdays
graduations weddings and holidays
somehow there seemed to be one thing
common to all these occasions they all
marked landmarks of a respectable life
these albums seemed more like calendars
in which the same date would be circled
year after year and then there were also
photographs that conveyed a value system
of belief political leaders spiritual
gurus film stars and the dead I wasn&#39;t
able to perceive these leaders in the
pictures at all because all I could
sense were their public roles I knew
these photographs to be important but I
also recognized that they were
incomplete or true I clearly wasn&#39;t
getting the picture either these
photographs weren&#39;t saying a mouse or
they weren&#39;t saying what I wanted to
hear I was suspicious these pictures
were speaking a language I didn&#39;t
understand at all and I was certain they
were saying something to me maybe even
about me I just had to know the strange
language when we learn a new language
the first thing we try and learn are the
obscenity the bad words it&#39;s the first
step to learning anything new
to kind of explore boundaries and
limitations like an attention-seeking
child I wanted to visually Express
taboos and concepts that I didn&#39;t quite
understand naturally my initial imagery
centered around sex religion and there I
photographed men who were passionate
about each other hunters who killed and
ate forbidden flesh
a nun addicted to something that in
other religions would be considered a
sin men who found their identity when
they dress up as women and old lady who
wish to live longer than the hundred and
twenty years she already had I got the
response I wanted shock disapproval and
come time from foraging laughter the
camera would be my dictionary it would
translate what I saw into pictures but I
would have to compose the sensation
because this was not a language of sight
it was the language of perception I
began exploring ideas about the light
and dark I photographed this blind lady
who could perceive my presence I
composed men and their origin I captured
the inner beast
I shot warrior communities and I trained
gentle trees I explored the inner world
of flowers and outer worlds created in
the comfort of my studio I would crawl
into three historic caves these were the
containers of the past
fortune telling parents that the bearers
of the future but the most difficult
thing to capture was the present because
it always wanted to escape an instant
once myths could never be traced
I believe the photographic language to
be best suited to describe the essence
of the ephemeral
perhaps this is what led me to
photograph people who believe that being
photographed would rob them of their
soul these were the tribes in there we
hadn&#39;t seen or spoken about each other&#39;s
world we didn&#39;t even understand each
other&#39;s language I wasn&#39;t quite clear
about their origin
I wasn&#39;t threatened by the remote region
we thrived inhabited as much as being
confronted by the danger of a
misunderstanding
my initial photographs of the tribals
were silent and careful portraits that
were the result of nonverbal observation
it&#39;s only after I started living with
them that their picture began to think
these tribes had a fascinating system of
communication they will indeed
conversation with the environment the
forests the woodland the desert
everything was alive just as they
themselves were alive much as the
knowledge was gleaned from the forest
and passed like precious heirlooms from
the generations their homes were an
organic outgrowth of the earth we would
cook and share food together
the tribes would narrate legends about
their tattoos they would tell me that
everything they wore was symbolic of
they believed the animals they
sacrificed would speak to their gods
their wall paintings would convey
messages to the spirits of their
ancestors I traveled and crossed borders
with three nomadic tribal groups these
tribes taught me an important aspect of
language culture is a language in itself
language carries meanings beyond itself
because its roots and reference points
lie and culture
to speak is to adopt the culture and to
engage in culture is like knowing a
language our tribal ancestors have
carried the knowledge of fire and
language to all across the world I
carried my knowledge of the photographic
language into the world of advertising
this is the first time my spoken
language would come face to face with my
recently acquired visual one my images
alone would not speak for themselves
words and images would be carefully
curated by creative directors and
editors other elements like my dog Rafi
layout design and tags would cooperate
with my imagery to construct a symbol I
photographed goddesses and the magic
portion objects would define and speak
of luxury a romance and taste would
trigger memories body language would
convey brand identity movement would
declare spirit and urgency my images
would acquire a personality that would
be desired consumed and for their
commercial photography made me aware
that intent is an important part of
language it is intent that would define
and indicate the interpretation of
images a picture speaks louder than
words
I wanted my picture to speak about
people who didn&#39;t have a voice either
these people didn&#39;t know their rights or
they chose to remain
because they didn&#39;t have a choice I&#39;m
going to share two stories that
represent these kind of people I
photographed women for workers in
illegal mines of chharia since 1936 it&#39;s
been illegal to employ a woman in a coal
mine after independence the women
workers who were displaced from their
job sought employment in unofficial and
illegal mines these women workers belong
to migrant communities in the bordering
there they&#39;re essentially from lower
class communities mainly the balance
generations are trapped in area mines
there are no employment opportunities
for women without an education or
financial resources labor laws and labor
unions do not exist in these mines
entire families are contracted to work
on a piecemeal basis children as young
as seven are employed in this coal mine
they put in fifteen hours a day for less
than a dollar these mines are operating
in an environmental disaster there are
70 underground fires that have been
burning for over a century these
underground fires caused sinkholes as
you can see in the photograph sulfur
dioxide and methane below from this
whole day in and day out the houses and
mines run into each other
the mists that you&#39;ve seen this
photograph contains poisonous gases
there is no compensation for victims of
accidents the entire environment is
highly polluted 1.4 billion tons of
carbon dioxide are the leaves into the
atmosphere every year
cancers of the stomach and lungs are
very common respiratory diseases called
many women to die in mid mind the second
documentary is about ritual sex slavery
in Telangana in some of these villages
pretty Besant girls as young as five are
dedicated to the village temple in a
ceremony their marriage to the village
temple deity after their marriage they
can never marry a man ever again these
women are called yogini in this
photograph a jogini reenacts and
initiation ceremony by holding mean
leaves in her mouth in the earlier days
the ceremony involved the dedicated girl
being paraded naked all over the village
but during these times the ceremony is
conducted secretly in those Javanese are
sacrificed for a variety of reasons it
could be to avoid ill fortune to her
family or for the prosperity of the
village in this photograph this jogini
was dedicated at the age of 10 during a
drought she&#39;s expected to pray at this
village shrine every day the rain for
the past 13 years
once jogi knees reach puberty we had
taken his personal sexual slaves of
either the village priest or the village
headman in many instances the virginity
is sold off to rich men in the area and
once he dies with her she becomes the
three sexual property of the entire
village regardless of caste class or
economic status Javanese have to work to
make a living in the fields they earn a
very very low income they do not get
sales to have
sex with the entire village at times to
get paid in time a bag of rice or
sometimes asari all the Javanese belong
to the untouchable community somehow
this doesn&#39;t seem to matter when men are
physically intimate with them if a
Giovanni had a son he wouldn&#39;t
acknowledge her or support her during
religious ritual and ceremony the jogini
becomes the mediator through whom the
gods and goddesses speak perhaps this is
the only time that she&#39;s treated with
some respect in this picture you see an
hiv-positive jogini who was being tended
to by her sister who is also a yoga knee
sexual diseases are rampant and claimed
the lives of many Javanese in this area
even in death the isolation of the
jogini continues this shrine in the
photograph marks a graveyard of the
jogini Javanese are not allowed to be
buried alongside a villager so you can
see a lot of shrines like this dotting
the outskirts of the village a picture
speaks more directly to people than
words ever will more so even today when
people are able to share moments ideas
and information more effectively through
the photographic language I want my
vision of the world and yours to be
recognized by this fascinating
