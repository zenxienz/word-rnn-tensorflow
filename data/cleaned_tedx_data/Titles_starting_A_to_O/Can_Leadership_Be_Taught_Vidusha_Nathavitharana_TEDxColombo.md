all my growing up years I was told to
simply shut up my mom would tell me baby
yes I was called baby I still am called
baby
most moms would know they said something
that never goes away and she Tony you
know still waters run deep don&#39;t talk
too much
in school I got into trouble because of
this because all the prefix would come
and say Molly why are you talking or
next time around I&#39;ll put you on the
phone not that I understood what on the
phone meant but I knew it was bad I
thought this would change when I came to
work but then my bosses came up to me
and said are you getting any work done
because all I can see you doing is
talking can you talk less and work more
and I then became a leadership trail and
I loved it I could talk all day nobody
could tell me to shut up and best of all
I got paid doing it the bubble burst
when one of my key clients came and
asked me this very very poignant
question she asked me look we do sure
for all the talking you do can you
honestly profess that you can train a
person into being a leader when he
dropped all the fancy slides I do
everything I worked really hard to do
all the examples brilliant jokes just
went out out the window back to the
drawing board because the truth of it
was for all the talking I do
I could never transform a person into
being a leader
and that hood because this was my
profession what was expected of me was
not to talk about leadership but to make
leaders the inspiration for this what
became a solution came because of my
daughter all of seven years old she came
and told me look up at a I&#39;ve a couple
of my friends are bullying me so I asked
her what were they telling you you know
she turned around and said I&#39;ve been
called a dumbass
so I said what do you expect you&#39;re my
daughter I don&#39;t think she was amused if
she turned out to be brilliant in
mathematics and science as I would
honestly have a paternity test done you
know but then my wife came and told me
look apart from the jokes you better
take this seriously because you know she
needs to get better at her studies and
my daughter fervently note I di I need
to get a tease now this is a bit of a
problem you know when you get relatively
low marks your daughter doing better
than you is rather scary and truth be
told even if I want to teach her when
she comes to me with the books I would
generally turn around and say that was
not in the syllabus
during my time they&#39;ve changed all the
syllabuses but I soon realized that
there was nothing I could do in teaching
her about the subjects but the true test
of it was for her to find her own inner
confidence for her to be able to find
that little inner voice in herself to
say you can do this
you&#39;ve got this don&#39;t worry about it so
I took a whitewater rafting hormones got
kicked out of home for taking a
whitewater rafting all of seven years
old and I told her don&#39;t tell your
mother
soon as she came through the doors I
went whitewater rafting there went my
dinner that day but I soon realized that
doing all of this meant that she was
finding her inner strength that every
little activity added up and the marks
that sorted itself up now the issue with
leadership training is that that the
entire process is flawed
we have people who come into a program
and most of them don&#39;t want to be there
I always ask audiences how many of you
really want to learn leadership no hands
go why are you here they said that the
lunch was really good
you mentioned my hip site so we asked
ourselves can we change this
then the answer was yes you can we
challenged people to study over hundred
pages 10 subjects by themselves watch
over a hundred videos at the end of a
two month period you had to go and make
sure that you had to sit for an exam get
60 marks out of a hundred to walk into
the workshop in the first place
clients were petrified they turned
around and asked are you serious these
guys are gonna go study by themselves
whilst working we said well if people
are really interested they would saving
grace was a young man by the name of
Ajith I&#39;m always inspired by people like
this he couldn&#39;t speak a word of English
when he came for the workshop and we
asked him how did you do this you know
did you copy that&#39;s something that we
know we are quite good at you didn&#39;t
look at the person next to you no so
what did you do so what he did was to go
to his own translator and get all of the
content that was purely an English
translated mind you hundred plus videos
translated into singular he barely got
sixty marks to come for the workshop
argit today is a it&#39;s our manager in one
of the leading companies in sri lanka
and he was not even an executive when he
joined the business we also asked
ourselves can we do something different
about the program itself rather than
talking down on people and spewing out
theories see leadership is understood
here but actually felt here you feel
leadership you need to internalize
leadership if leadership can be done in
two days
well don&#39;t you think we don&#39;t run a
program for the Sri Lankan Parliament
the entire fraternity would do it for
free and we&#39;ll all be better for it
because we&#39;ll have a fantastic set of
leaders not that I&#39;m saying we don&#39;t
have a now but they were so often you
hear about a few people who forget
certain things so what can we do in our
programs that actually can be different
we drew inspiration from a lot of team
attic areas here&#39;s a few examples um I
used to be always backstage being on
stage petrifies me in fact at one of the
theater productions that college did I
was in charge of drawing the curtain
unfortunately for me there was a really
good-looking girl right in the front
seats I forgot all about the drama
and the people backstage much hung madam
curtain curtain and I still wasn&#39;t
hearing anything because I was staring
right at her and eventually somebody
shouted boy curtain nigga thought Anika
and that was the end of the production
altogether so drawing this little
inspiration from theater we asked
ourselves can we can we get people to do
something with theater here&#39;s what we
did on the second day of a program we
challenged people who barely know each
other
when they come to the program to do a
drama there to write a script they have
to rehearse it there to find the props
there to find the costumes they have to
do the makeup do all of this plus bring
50 people as the audience all within
four hours sounds impossible right but
every single batch is it
we brought general for a caboodle and
told him to play some drums and then we
invite the
kissa pants to play drummers in one hour
to bits and ensemble performance they
look at us as if though we are
absolutely stark raving mad but they
acid in one hour at the end of it all we
ask them what did you learn and their
insights are brilliant
most of them tell us we learnt that
leadership is not singular activity it&#39;s
something that is collective we learnt
there are inner confidence matters we
learned that we can do absolutely
anything that we set our minds to
now that is feeling leadership at the
end of the programs we tell participants
go do something with your learning
generally after program all you have is
a questionnaire that you get signed off
and picked off and hopefully you will
get good results nothing more here we
have young men and women going out and
doing amazing things there was a young
gentleman who said look there are car
parks it&#39;s doing nothing let me make
some money out of it and you know what
he did he brought in bidders and made
sure that it was sold to holding
companies almost all of the car parks of
a leading supermarket was sold off
collecting a whopping 20 million rupees
all within a span of two months
imagine our surprise when a young lady
turned up all of 24 years old and said
we have too many meetings you can relate
to that right far too many meetings
people talk nothing happens
what did they do well they got together
planned a few things around looked at
and understood why it was taking so long
and then put it right and she let that
initiative and she was the youngest
person in the meeting for the assessment
that we conduct after the program her
entire planning department turned up and
they said look this may not have any
financial gain but we don&#39;t come to work
on Saturdays at all now thanks to her so
finally after leadership programs we had
an opportunity to prove that there was
tangible
ROI after training as well as the
absolute possibility of transforming
people increases now is all of this our
brilliance is it the program that
transforms people of course not I wish
that was the case but this was truly
getting everyone involved in the
leadership process leadership is a
collective exercise so is developing
leaders there were managers and senior
managers who didn&#39;t come back and turn
around and tell young participants after
program MAPE and easy and Tony Dungy
noise or a young executive who went out
there who was too scared to try out
something new here were a bunch of
managers who were totally supporting
that initiative of course the
participants themselves realize their
potential and do brilliantly well
because all the inhibitors are taken out
and of course we play a little role
in putting all of this together and
managing that space and managing that
process it&#39;s about time we rethought
leadership development programs she is
what I learned I genuinely learned that
we can teach leadership I genuinely
realized that people were far more
capable than we give them credit for I
also realized that every single human
being out there doesn&#39;t want to fail
every single one wants to be a success
but they just don&#39;t have the space to I
realized that our role is not to teach
about leadership I realized that our
role is to facilitate the learning of
leadership but very importantly
transforming them into being true
leaders now one of my great mentors the
gentleman sitting right there said
something that struck my heart
everything he told me look with Lucia if
your children don&#39;t become better than
you you have fathered in vain and I
mulled over this for many moons and I
think the same is true for my trade if
we do not make our participants do more
and be more than us then we have thought
in ray thank you
you
