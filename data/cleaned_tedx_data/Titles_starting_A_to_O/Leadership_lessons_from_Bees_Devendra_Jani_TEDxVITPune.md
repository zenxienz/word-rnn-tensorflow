let me start with a question how do you
feel when you&#39;re close to nature say a
waterfall or maybe a beautiful river bed
or a nice sunny morning at a beach my
observation is we humans feel happy
whenever we are close to nature there
are many tools we have like thermometer
to tell you what is the temperature
compass to tell you what is the
direction but is there a tool which
tells you how close is your place to
nature the only answer I could find is
bees if there&#39;s a lot of radiation you
not find bees if there&#39;s a lot of
pollution you&#39;ll not find bees there if
there is less of flora for an oxygen you
not find bees there so guys let&#39;s
welcome bees in our cities not for bees
but for happy cities and how did I get
into the whole bee thing like most of us
I was a bit concerned about the use of
chemicals and pesticides in farming so I
made a bottle tower prototype where you
put bottles one on top of the other it
saves water takes less space and gives
me organic veggies I was getting a good
supply of chilies and mint but there was
a problem with tomatoes the tomato
flowers were not converting into
Tomatoes I was a bit worried so I did a
quick google search and the fact I got
to know was something which is very
impressive how many of you eat tomatoes
or tomato ketchup when I&#39;m sure the fact
will help you guys as well it&#39;s only
bumblebees which do a good pollination
for tomato plants and they were not
travelling all the way to the fifth
floor of my apartment so I wanted to
know more about bees and I took a
beekeeping course and every lesson I
learned from it when I compare it to my
call
life I thought I should share it with
you guys and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here
that&#39;s the bumble bee pollinating the
tomato plant now look at the landscape
which these bees have divided themselves
they have different unique strengths Rob
bees can fly higher
indica bees can stay in darker areas and
Floria bees are ruling the plains they
have their different strengths since our
childhood we&#39;ve been taught to focus on
what went wrong keep learning something
new whereas I would want to urge you
guys to understand know your strengths
and then walk on those because good
leaders know what are their strengths
and then they choose the landscape to
compete most of the species have sting
and they make hexagonal shape hives but
there is this species which is stingless
and makes circular hives and they are
the smallest one so they can get into
bigger flowers as well as smaller
flowers most of the medicinal plants
have smaller flowers very small slice
like Tulsi and the honey which these
bees make is that&#39;s why considered to be
most precious in Ayurveda
so it&#39;s okay to be different you do not
follow the herd mentality and do what
others are doing if you know your
strengths it&#39;s okay to be different now
let&#39;s understand how a bee hive is
organized every hive is in this way top
portion is the honey side portion is the
pollen which they eat for protein source
and bottom portion is their broods and
eggs and that gives us this lesson that
in order to be successful you ought to
stay organized guys organized in your
personal and professional both sites
let&#39;s get to know the bee family
the Queen every time contemplating on
how to make the hive work and function
successfully what&#39;s the weather outside
how much eggs
how much food is there in the hive what
is the security issues for the hive and
she runs this whole hive flawlessly very
successfully and that sometimes leads me
to think that our organizations run by
women more successful than organizations
run by men I don&#39;t know to add to it
there are thousands of bees in a good
hive around 40 to 60 thousand of worker
bees continuously nurturing nourishing
the baby&#39;s getting nectar to the hive
constructing the hive the impressive
fact is all the worker bees are female
bees in the whole hive yes there are
drones male bees and they do nothing in
the hive they absolutely do nothing even
the feeding part is done by the worker
bees to them they are meant for one
important purpose they meet with the
Queen once in a year and then they die
but when there are challenging times
there is no nectar outside less food
inside the first thing worker bees will
do is stop feeding the drones and let
them die and in the context of corporate
life that is what I want to tell you
guys if there are rough times and
organizations need to layoff then these
will the people who don&#39;t add value to
organizations to be let off first so
don&#39;t be drones value add to whatever
you are assigned to or whatever you are
doing or whatever is to do there is also
a progression pattern which I saw after
being in the cell for a few days the
first thing the bee does when she comes
out is the housekeeping job cleaning in
all other part after few days the gland
which secretes royal jelly develops
which they use for feeding the babies so
they become nurse bees from the normal
housekeeping store
then there is another gland which
develops which secretes wax so then they
become architect and construction bees
and after having known the hive better
then they get the guard bees or the
police like authoritative role and
finally the most important role to add
value to the hive is to get nectar so
they become foraging bees and this
pattern shows me that you first develop
on the skills before you take your role
well if you are given a role your dream
role but if you&#39;re not able to fulfill
it or you don&#39;t have the enough skills
to do justice to it will you be happy I
personally will not be forget about the
organization so let&#39;s upscale ourself
before we get through that dream role we
want now good leaders put their best
foot forward and do the best they can
I&#39;ll try attitude doesn&#39;t make you a
good leader and that&#39;s one of the
examples I want to share with bees that
they have the best architecture I could
see over centuries of learning and
evolution they found that hexagonal
cells are more helpful wax is more
precious than honey for bees why because
when they eat 4 kgs of honey only then
they can make just 1 kg of wax so they
don&#39;t want to waste backs and then they
need honey for their bad times so they
need as much space as they can and
hexagonal as a shape reduces wages of
wax if you see how much wax is wasting
when you put circles together and it
also stores more honey it&#39;s not about
just the best architecture the way they
communicate how do bees communicate
there is a bee dance which happens in
the hire a foraging becomes into the
hive follower bees are watching it what
is happening if the bees is the bee is
dancing in eight fashion that means the
flower is beyond 50
in circular fashion within 50 miles how
long is the B dancing is the distance
they need to travel which angle to the
Sun is the B dancing is the direction
they need to fly they also get samples
of the nectar and the pollen for the
follower bees to taste that this is the
flower you need to go to no gap in the
communication what you asked for
and what is delivered to you and good
leaders understand that communication is
the key communication is the basis of
any soft skill you would want to have at
the same time there are some flowers
who&#39;ve customized themselves or adapted
for some specific species of bees that
is the bond they have developed with
their customer and leaders are always
customer focused not just that after
you&#39;ve delivered something what is the
by-product of it an experiment done on a
farm land where they covered a portion
where bees cannot get in
Ouiser be a portion which was open and
they yield in the open part where bees
were doing polarization was 80 to 200
percent more without using fertilizers
or any of the jargons people talk about
they are the best friends of the
pharmacy even the quality and the taste
of the fruit which was developed was
much better than any other mechanism of
polarization we&#39;ve heard about different
tastes of honey or types of honey named
honey
German honey mustard honey how is that
possible bees are very particular about
the tasks they take in hand go to the
flower take the nectar come back if
there is nectar remaining go back to the
same flower come back if there are other
flowers on the same plant or tree go
back to that flower and come back and
that&#39;s where I was thinking they are
doing single tasks with a good focus is
that something which is also advisable
for us
research shows that humans when they
focus on a particular task or a single
task the results are better than you&#39;re
doing multitasking
I&#39;m not concluding anything over here
it&#39;s on individual personal way of how
do you multitask but this is what they
are doing good leaders always have a
succession plan in place tomorrow if
they are not there how are things going
to work in their absence if
unfortunately queen bee dies or she&#39;s
become old who decides who will be the
next Queen it&#39;s the worker bees who
decide who is going to be the next Queen
the last fertile eggs few of them five
to six which the queen has laid worker
bees will fill additional royal jelly in
it elongate those cells and cover it the
only difference between worker and queen
bee is queen bee as a complete
development of the reproductive organs
which others have not got because of
that lack of royal jelly in the cell so
they put enough royal jelly the first
bee which comes out from the Queen cell
will be the queen of the hive and she&#39;ll
sting other cells so that all other
Queens die in the cell if coincidentally
there are two queens which come out at
the same time the worker bees will
ensure that both of them fight and the
winner bee will be the queen of the hive
and sometimes that leads me to think
should students select who is going to
be their teacher for any subject or
should employ select who&#39;s going to be
their next CEO it&#39;s just an idea okay
and if you selected your queen how
committed you are to it this is an
amazing news I thought for two days
these bees were stuck to the car and a
bee expert came he opened the Dicky when
the Queen was stuck flew the Queen and
flew the whole hive behind her another
amazing fact is they&#39;re very very
committed guys it&#39;s not about me it&#39;s
about the whole hive
and in case of risk they are ready to
lay down their lives for the hive so any
task which is given to you any
responsibility which is given to you if
you do it with sheer commitment it is
evident and visible visible in the way
you do it visible in the deliverables
you have after you&#39;ve completed that
task and based on the commitment your
fun level or the way you enjoy the task
also increases Tutankhamen storm was
opened and they found honey in it which
was three thousand years old and it was
still edible
how surprising today no food industry
company can tell you that my product can
last for three thousand years and you
can still eat and you know survive after
eating that so any product we design we
plan have a futuristic vision to it not
necessary it&#39;d be short-sighted focus is
something which is very important for us
in our life skies bees as soon as the
Sun is up they go out for their foraging
part before it is down get back in hive
focuses Sun flower hive and so does good
leader also ensure that they keep focus
on their goals because your focus moves
away from your goal and your goal moves
away from you so stay focusing like
queen bee is very very particular about
cleanliness in the hive she will not lay
egg if she finds a slightest dirt in the
cell so the worker bees are continuously
ensuring the hive is clean they also
have propolis in the hive which keeps
the hive antifungal antibacterial and
sterilized all the time that&#39;s where I
believe that we humans in order to take
good decisions which result to
successful outputs we have to ensure we
have a healthy body and healthy
very important fact I got to know while
my training is that 80% of the
pollination done by bees for our food
if there are no bees there&#39;ll be no food
and today if all bees die within four
years the species of us will be extinct
so it&#39;s not just for them it&#39;s for
ourselves as well we need to ensure we
take care of bees and that&#39;s where
something clicks to me is we should have
our organizations or our skills as such
that the very existence is important not
just for the organization employees but
for for the customers as well it pains
to see this where one of the towns in
China all the bees have run away because
of the pollution level there and they&#39;re
using humans to do the pollination with
the help of brush adding cost to the
farmers but more or less its development
on the cost of nature which is a debt
trap guys so let&#39;s have ideas which
develop but not on the cost of nature so
my only sure humble request would be
let&#39;s friend with plants and let&#39;s
friend with the bees what minimum we can
do is grow bee friendly flowers one of
the example is mustard which we use in
our day-to-day cooking just put that in
your flower pot or the gardens nearby
because it is a very good source of
protein and nectar for bees because not
all flowers have nectar or all flowers
have Poland so this is one of the good
mix which helps them at the same time
it&#39;s summer so let&#39;s make water stations
for bees they cannot swim so would
request to put some pebbles or stick in
those water stations so that they can
land and then drink properly back to my
bottle tower experiment
I got a hack I used my mobile in
vibration mode
touch the flower it opened the pollen
sack and pollination happened and I
started getting a supply of tomatoes as
well there and I&#39;m enjoying them so
here&#39;s wishing you all to be happy and
be the lead guys
[Applause]
