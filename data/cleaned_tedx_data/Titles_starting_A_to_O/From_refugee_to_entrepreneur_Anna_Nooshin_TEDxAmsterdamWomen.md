someone asked me the other day what
makes you special I had to say it
completely took me aback and I was
really surprised that he asked me this
and I came up with all these stupid
excuses that I didn&#39;t really believe in
myself and then at the end I just said
you know what I don&#39;t know what to tell
you so if I would ask you to list ten
things you don&#39;t like about yourself you
would probably list 15 and if I would
ask you to to list up maybe just five
nice things I&#39;m pretty sure we all have
a hard time acknowledging those so why
do we hesitate so much acknowledging the
fact that were special beings I was
doing research for this talk and I ended
up watching one of Mel Robbins&#39;s talks
that talks and she&#39;s an amazing
self-help author and she estimated the
chances of us being born as one in four
hundred trillion and I&#39;m not really good
at math but that number alone feels like
it&#39;s quite astonishing so to me the mere
fact that we&#39;re here in this room is a
pretty special fact and so looking back
at my own life and thinking of this
theory I think that my specialness may
be started when I was seven years old my
parents fled their country so when I was
seven my roots got ripped from Iran and
I got placed in a Western society where
I didn&#39;t know anyone I didn&#39;t have any
connection to the culture and when
you&#39;re a refugee you have to live in
refugee camps I don&#39;t know if anyone
knows them or anyone has visited them
but it&#39;s quite um not a nice place to be
and you have to either share a huge
space like this with multiple families
and you have to live there and sleep
there all in one place or if you&#39;re
lucky you have a bedroom that you have
to share with your family and in my case
we were four of us and people always ask
me what that moment was like for me how
I experienced those years and I have
say the beauty of being a child is that
you never tend to see any obstacles so I
grew up thinking that my life was very
normal I had no idea that I didn&#39;t have
a home and I&#39;ll never forget the moment
where I decided that I wanted to be
successful in life because when you&#39;re a
refugee you don&#39;t have any money you
don&#39;t have a lot of clothing of your own
and you have to rely on the kindness of
others to give you those stuff and I
remember going to school and I have had
on this beautiful floral dress and I
felt so pretty and one of the popular
girls came up to me and she looked at me
she was like I love your dress it&#39;s so
cute and I felt so seen and I felt so
special
until she took another look as she was
like it used to be mine and she walked
away I swear to you I&#39;ll never forget
how small I felt at that moment because
I felt like I was unworthy of her
presence I felt insecure I felt like I
didn&#39;t have anything in life at that
point and at that moment I decided that
if I was going to do anything I was
going to be successful and I could buy
all the dresses that I wanted in life
and so fast forward to 2017 I&#39;ve been
running my own company since I was 24
and I&#39;ve been doing that very
successfully and I do what I love the
most I create stories online and I share
them with millions of people and it got
me thinking still even after
accomplishing all these goals and
everyone telling me every day how much
they loved it and admire it I still
couldn&#39;t answer this one person why I
was special and so to regain that
ability and to kind of share with you
why I want to be in a more positive
space I&#39;ve added listed up three things
that I think have made my life
extraordinary so far and number one is I
do not let my past define me so I come
from a home where domestic abuse wasn&#39;t
unheard of I come from a family where we
had to deal with a lot of death my
mother&#39;s family got killed in an
earthquake and I ran she never got to
say goodbye and on top of that my
stepfather who&#39;s the love of my mother&#39;s
life is fighting a
a hard battle with cancer at this point
which is going to be incurable
so listing those things up could sound
really depressing and they could get me
emotional but still I wake up every day
and I kid you not the first thing that I
do is thank whatever is out there the
universe that I have another day and I
could ask everyone why me why all this
stress why me but the real question I
think is why not me I think we all have
the chance that this could happen to us
and the fact that all of this happened
makes me really really happy every day
that I have another day so because I do
not let my past to find me that makes me
special number two is that I am flawed
but that&#39;s okay
I noticed that I fight a battle with
myself every day trying to be more
vulnerable I have a really hard time
asking people for help I have a really
hard time to show my softer side and I
want to teach myself that it&#39;s okay to
do that I still feel insecure on a daily
basis and it&#39;s because I feel like I
compare myself to other people on social
media a lot and I want myself to know
that even though I do that it&#39;s okay as
long as I&#39;m able to admit it I can work
on it and I think that makes me special
and number three I think anything is
possible in life I used to hate the word
luck because people would tell me oh
you&#39;ve been lucky and I feel like you
did such a great job despite your
background that you&#39;re here where you
are today and it felt like an insult
because I felt like it wasn&#39;t them
telling me that I did a good job or that
my brain was working or that I have a
good sense of business but I felt like
they were wrapping an insult and gifting
paper and nowadays I kind of feel like
like is it luck isn&#39;t that much of a bad
word because I do feel lucky I&#39;ve been
very lucky to know what I want in life
I&#39;m very lucky to have a dream and I
don&#39;t have a plan B and it&#39;s all I know
how to do it so I feel like that is
definitely lucky and my ability to dream
really big and to know that anything is
possible that&#39;s why I&#39;m special
and so coming here I watched a shitload
of TED talks I asked if I could curse
and they told me I could and you know
they firstly made me really really
insecure because all of them were very
scientific or most of them and I stand
in front of you I don&#39;t have any fancy
graphics I don&#39;t have any statistics I
don&#39;t have dirty jokes to make you laugh
I don&#39;t really have anything that can be
proven but I do feel like for the first
time in months I&#39;m very comfortable
being in front of you guys without
anything to hide behind I don&#39;t have my
camera with me I usually vlog everything
I don&#39;t have any slides I didn&#39;t want
anything to be up here because I just
wanted to tell you the story that I&#39;ve
been through in a nutshell in 10 minutes
I only have 238 left and so I&#39;m sure we
all have these moments when someone asks
you something that you wish you could
just go back and reclaim an answer so if
you have those moments and if I can
leave you with any piece of advice it
would just be what I&#39;ve learned in the
past few years and I would want to tell
you that I&#39;ve had the fortune or maybe
the the dis fortune or unfortunate
whatever you want to call it that I&#39;ve
experienced all these things in life
that are very very heavy and a lot of
death and a lot of things that we don&#39;t
really want to experience and I&#39;ve also
I know what it&#39;s like to have nothing
and I know what it&#39;s like to have
everything now where I am today and I
want you to know that if you ever feel
insecure like I did when she told me in
my dress was hers or if you ever feel
small or if you feel like you&#39;re in this
space where you don&#39;t really know where
you belong and why you&#39;re special you&#39;re
either comparing yourself to other
people which is a waste of all of our
times because we&#39;re not going to be the
same or you have too many options in
life and I believe that both of those
things can be really really beautiful
and if I look at my stepdad who&#39;s
fighting at this point I feel like
anyone who is underprivileged or
unhealthy would give anything to have a
slight bit of what we have today and if
all of that didn&#39;t help you please
remember that you&#39;re still one in four
hundred trillion
cute
