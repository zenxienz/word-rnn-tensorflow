planting seeds a course an idea a
passion when I want to plant my seeds I
have to wait for them to mature and
develop on the plant it takes patience
it takes time I take some of the seeds I
dry them I clean them I take out all of
the bad seeds and I throw them away some
of the seeds I leave on the plant
because I want the wind to blow them and
you&#39;ll see on some of the seeds I&#39;ve got
that white fluffy stuff and the wind
blows in where it may the seeds land in
different places some of the places
where the seeds land are ready to
nurture that seed and grows into a
beautiful plant some of the places where
the seeds land are rocky of too hot too
cold not enough water and they try and
grow but they die
always I&#39;m careful where I get my seeds
from I take them from the biggest
healthiest strongest plants that have
learned to adapt to their space in the
environment if somebody else is giving
me seeds I check with them and I make
sure are they open pollinated seeds that
will grow I can catch the seeds from I
can plant them again and grow and
continue to do that or are their hybrid
seeds that look amazing the first time
you plant them but when you catch the
seeds of them and you try and regrow
them they come out all wonky and walked
and you have to keep going back and
rebuy in seeds are they genetically
modified seeds that have been corrupted
and tainted
seeds blowing in the wind ideas
experiences that we&#39;ve had people that
we&#39;ve met my granny used to come and
stand over us when we ate and she would
scoop her finger around the edge of the
plate and shove it in her mouth so that
we wouldn&#39;t waste one single drop of
precious food she would wear a garlic
necklace around her neck plant herbs
stuff our faces with herbes we never got
sick she would rant about people using
those aerosol spray cans and she walked
everywhere this was 30 40 years ago
she she would she had a bag and she took
it with her wherever she went and she
collects a plastic bags and she put them
inside she even rummaged in people&#39;s
dust bins to take the plastic bags off
because she didn&#39;t want them blowing
away and then she would cut the bags up
and she would make them into these
amazing plastic slippers or handbags and
whenever you saw my granny she was
walking she does that she had a long
trail of plastic bags and she shuffles
with her plastic bags and if a visitor
came then she would walk in with a piece
of paper and could he draw the shape of
their foot and then she would go out and
few days later she would hand them
plastic slippers and if they were lucky
there would be a flower on the slippers
a yellow flower because she found a
yellow plastic bag these were all seeds
that were blowing in the wind that
landed inside my heart and my mind and
my soul which was ready to nurture those
seeds when the seeds are about six days
old they come out of the ground and they
need extra care they need wholesome
compost and worm tea they need sunshine
they need water they need to be nurtured
they need to be looked after during this
phase if you look after the plants they
get strong roots
as with the children and the people that
have I&#39;ve seen in my life that have had
seeds planted in their hearts they&#39;ve
needed to be nurtured and given the
tools to be able to take that excitement
or that idea and put it into an action
and I found with children they have this
clarity about them and the stubbornness
and this fierceness that when they hear
an injustice they suddenly turn into
these warriors and they want to protect
it as with my own they want to protect
the animals and the people and I know
that there are parents out there who
cursed me in the nights because their
children go shopping with them now and
read every single label and if they&#39;re
any gmos they refuse to eat them the
whole diet and the family has changed
all they take the seeds that have been
given to them at one of our workshops
all the seedlings and they go home and
they dig up the whole rose bed and they
plant the spinach instead currently and
in the last 20 years in South Africa we
have been and not only myself mera more
recently people have been fighting
against the corruption and the poison of
genetically modified crops now they are
the RNA interference GMOs that are being
unleashed into Africa which turn off
genes and I&#39;ve been found to turn off a
gene and the mammal that we&#39;re fighting
against and in the last few months the
laws the seed laws that are about to be
passed that promise to take our freedom
of our seeds and away from us and give
them to those big corporations where we
can&#39;t swap and share and give seeds away
as we did in the past so they&#39;ve been
public hearings that have been held all
around South Africa but they weren&#39;t
advertised very well so not many people
heard about them and could go and speak
out for seed freedom but the amazing
activist community that we have in this
country found out where the public
hearings were and we went to some of
them
and this is the one in the Eastern Cape
I went with my dad and my 13 year old
daughter that is her and three other
farmers who came in a big room full of
government officials and we had an
opportunity to speak and Ruth&#39;s is her
name over the last few years she&#39;s been
coming with me to marches that have been
doing and workshops and Steve has
planted in her heart and she&#39;s so
stubborn and passionate about human
rights she came with me and she says I&#39;m
listen quietly and at the end she stood
up and she said she summarized the day
in her fierce stubborn way calmly and
respectfully and she ended by saying as
you all know he who owns the seed owns
the world it was dead silence and they
said okay please we&#39;re gonna take a vote
could you put your hands up if you want
these bulls to pass as they are nobody
put their hand up oh wait there&#39;s one
person excuse me sir is your hand are
you stretching oh okay
no one a piece of five people that were
representing the millions of people in
South Africa and they were more public
hearings where other people went to an
amazing places like the African Center
for biodiversity who gave workshops to
help explain the Bulls to our farmers so
that they could represent it wasn&#39;t
enough
but we&#39;ve been asking him have been
fighting for them to give us another
opportunity to go and speak for our seed
rights and just yesterday I heard that
they granted us another public hearing
in PE we don&#39;t have to drive for three
hours like I did um and in um Tata and
in Queenstown so we&#39;re having another
opportunity this boy his father is John
and zerah he&#39;s an amazing permaculturist
an organic farmer in South Africa that&#39;s
his boy his uncle its seed was planted
in with that boy&#39;s heart
he&#39;s been nurtured by his family and
taught IRA grow food
and he will never be hungry he will
always be able to feed himself and other
people
and he will always have freedom
innocence when I applied my veggies
I always intercrop so I put herbes and
other kinds of plants with them
sometimes they taller plants and they
give them enough shade there are things
like porridge that spring bees so they
can pollinate and plants like garlic
that deter pests and nasturtiums which
let the pests eat them so that they save
the food crops and green manures Pertex
the soil and gives it nitrogen all of us
creates diversity I don&#39;t have to do
anything with my plants after that
except pray for rain they grow strong
beautiful and healthy I can leave them
and it&#39;s like that in our in our with
people in our cultures with different
various different types of people that
come together create strength and
diversity as in the activist world that
I&#39;m privileged enough to be a part in
there&#39;s so many different kinds of
people that come together that creates
this diversity which creates strength
they&#39;re people that are like those
nasturtiums that let the pace to eat
them so that they can keep the food crop
safe the people that are in the ground
and planting the lawyers they are the
doctors and the researchers and the
scientists and then they&#39;re the people
on the ground who are creating the
change grassroots diversity creates
change but on the farms sometimes you
see mono crops that&#39;s when you take one
plot and you just pull the whole farm
with one plant and they don&#39;t meet
because the week the weeds get in the
way of the chapters so they would spray
herbicides on them and the herbicides
disrupt the soil and kill the microbes
in the soil so they&#39;ve gotta feed
chemical fertilizers to try and fix that
problem and because there&#39;s no diversity
the pen come in and have a field day
and then I&#39;m gonna bring in pesticide so
these plant cannot live on their own
they need so much babying they need so
much eating they need so much meat so
many resources so much water they look
like other plants the nutritional values
not the same because there&#39;s no
diversity and then we eat the food and
we narrow our bodies and we put them in
a bars like I do because I just think
they&#39;re so beautiful and then we wait
for the flowers to come and then we
catch the seeds and we start again so I
want to just give you an example of how
much abundance is created by one seed
these are carrots the carrot one carrot
seed the flower is about that big you
can&#39;t really see on it but it&#39;s big
there are hundreds of seeds inside a
carrot but for argument&#39;s sake I&#39;m gonna
work with 200 probably way more than
that 200 I have one plant after 8 weeks
I&#39;ll catch the seed of 200 seeds I plant
this 200 seeds and I catch them again I
have 40,000 another 2 months I plant
them again and I have 8 million I plant
them again and I have 16 hundred million
seeds over for season that&#39;s one year
from one seed so there&#39;s three things I
want to say about that one why are there
hungry people in our country when seeds
are in abundance and two why are we
buying seeds
why are we so buying see what happened
to the art of seed saving and it is a
skill in an art that it&#39;s not hard to
learn I learnt it I don&#39;t know
everything about it
but anyone can do it and the last thing
is when you buy the seed it cost one ran
each ok
sixteen hundred million seed equals
sixteen hundred million ran from one
seed it makes you realize why it&#39;s so
sought-after to earn seeds
20 years ago more than 20 years ago my
husband-to-be said to me Rushka do you
know one day you&#39;re gonna be buying
water and I looked at him I laughed in
his face I said what are you crazy
buy water that&#39;s the stupidest thing
I&#39;ve ever heard in my life if you&#39;re
under 30 you this is a known for you
buying water in a plastic bottle still
but then it was so foreign
I couldn&#39;t grasp that you can imagine my
shock and horror the day that I heard
that a person can own a seed not just
the genetically modified corrupted see
that&#39;s patented but ask one of our seeds
I&#39;ll see you can imagine my shock and
horror on that day and over all the
years and haven&#39;t been many compared to
lots of people that I&#39;ve been fighting
against GMOs and their poisons and the
way that they have just destroyed our
environments and our people always in
the back of my heart I felt calm because
I knew you know what you can have those
seeds I don&#39;t want them they&#39;re
corrupted my seeds are safe our seeds
are safe but with these new laws coming
odds they&#39;re going to be able to own
those seeds too sometimes I was fighting
and I have been on my own sometimes and
often with a small army I&#39;ve turned
myself inside out and upside down people
have told me I&#39;m an that and that I&#39;m
extreme but never before in all the
years that I had been fighting against
GMOs and their toxic herbicides have I
seen so many people from all walks of
life come together about this freedom of
our seeds so many different people the
diversity is unbelievable and the
outrage that we are going to be told
what we can and can&#39;t do with our own
seeds and possibly be a criminal for
exchanging them
but see FIFA is my seed Guardian sister
she at the last gathering we went to she
came walking towards me and she was
holding her hands to her heart and she
opened her hands and inside of her hands
were these beautiful mealy seeds it&#39;s a
picture of them now if you know the
history of South Africa the more than
80% of our are maize is genetically
modified and and they contaminate other
may sort of five non-genetically
modified maize is very rare protecting
life sometimes people say why do you
call her guardian
oh wow you must see this woman you&#39;ll
understand she protects these seeds she
gave him to me and we were in a seedy
place with seedy people like me who
loves seeds and they all wanted sandwich
she slept there either way just like no
I&#39;m giving mr. Rushka I wanted to
multiply them you&#39;re gonna all get yours
don&#39;t worry and then I had my seeds
there and while I was talking I was
watching someone hand the seeds out and
it really touched me and when I was
going home
I forgot at the car I said to my boy
child well Joey the seat guardian just
gave me her fishes seeds and before I
could sit down you&#39;ve taken some of them
in front of them and he was standing
watching them with his wounds mommy I&#39;m
gonna protect the seeds of my life I&#39;m
multiplying see I&#39;m gonna give him to my
friends and they&#39;re gonna multiply him
now he&#39;s 11 years old and he can see the
other day somebody called me out of the
blue message means it rich girl want to
come and give you some seeds now we live
in South Africa you know the Consul
mayor just invite anyone over so I see
it but I heard the word seed so I said
let&#39;s go to and you can meet me in a
public place and the sky pitched up he&#39;s
a gypsy his name&#39;s mark I&#39;ve never seen
him before
he came with his box and he started
unpacking and he just like Bob as a
whole table with PCs and putting them in
bags for me and some of them have never
seen in my life some of the names I&#39;ve
never heard of you know 90% of our seed
varieties are extinct today I&#39;m gonna
hurt of in any said rich got I can plant
these seeds but I go and I collect them
from people and I want to give them to
you
because you can plant them and I want
you to multiply them and it really
touched me deeply these are the kind of
people that are in our country ivy where
she says powerful warrior woman and she
carries her corn with maize varieties
with the river she goes in no arms and
the pea hand on heritage seeds she even
puts them on airplanes I don&#39;t know how
she machine manages to get their big
onto airplane and when she comes and she
talks she always makes them with her and
the last time I saw her she gets she got
up and she always thinks for seed
freedom for power bringing the power
back to the people and she starts
singing and everyone was sitting quietly
singing with her she stood up but she
looked at them and she said get up you
can&#39;t fight for seed freedom when he&#39;s
sitting down you can&#39;t fight the seed
freedom&#39;s when you are sitting down I&#39;ve
got something that I want to give you
these are my babies some of my babies
and I&#39;m going to give each of you
you can come fetch from me later but
some of you now I&#39;m gonna give each of
you two seeds one seed is for you to
plant and multiply into sixteen hundred
million food and the other one is for
you to give to your child or to any
child that you see and I want you to
tell them the story from your
perspective and just give them a seed
and see what they do with it
and if those go through and we do not
continue to fight for seed freedom I
could be arrested for just doing what
I&#39;ve done we&#39;re creating a wall of faces
of people who are willing to take words
and put them into action for seed
freedom and put a face to it
so that they can make a declaration for
seed freedom an action of seed freedom
growing seed sharing seeds helping with
the seed balls that are coming out
signing the open letters that we need
and so that the people in the
generations to come can look back at the
faces of their ancestors and say those
are the people that fought for seed
freedom who is willing to put these
words into an action and they face to
the words with me
[Applause]
