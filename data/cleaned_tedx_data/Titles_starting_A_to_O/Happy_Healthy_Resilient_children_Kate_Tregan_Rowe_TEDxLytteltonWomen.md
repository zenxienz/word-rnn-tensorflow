everywhere I look I see busy stressed
adults and children
I see people rushing from one thing to
the next taking them out of connection
with themselves and each other my
observation of the world at present is
that we are disconnected and out of
balance emotionally and yet we are
intrinsically motivated to connect in my
interaction with people and children in
my work and personal life I have seen a
pattern and that is of avoiding emotion
and connection our relationship with
each other
our children and the earth is not in a
happy or healthy place we are not okay
our children are not okay when over
eight million children under the age of
17 in the US alone are on medication to
help them cope with their emotions we
are not okay over two million of them on
antidepressants and an additional two
million are on anti-anxiety medication
drugs are not the solution connection is
the solution cultivating connection with
ourselves and others is the way to bring
more happiness and balance into our and
our children&#39;s lives we are offered so
much opportunity in this world to
connect post on Facebook accept this
friend request like this photo on
Instagram tweet these are all illusions
of connection they&#39;re not true
connection and yet we jump at these
opportunities because we are in a key
intrinsically wired for connection
however we move towards the
lusion of connection because it seems
less risky less vulnerable true
connection is risky true connection is
vulnerable you can fall in love and have
your heart broken you can be rejected
friendships can end us as a society we
are so fearful of being connected and
vulnerable and are feeling big feelings
this is not only because we are afraid
of a sensation of those painful emotions
but more importantly is we don&#39;t have a
safe place to go when we when we&#39;re in
the midst of those emotions we yearn for
a place to go that is safe where we can
express what we are feeling and be
accepted and heard we yearn for the
experience of emotional safety emotional
safety can be defined as when a person
is okay with expressing who they are and
how they are feeling they feel confident
to take risks and be challenged and they
have a natural curiosity about the world
around them understand that emotional
safety means we are okay to show all of
who we are let me share an example of
how emotional safety can show up in a
child&#39;s behavior the situation is this a
child has broken a glass if they feel
emotionally safe they will simply go and
tell an adult or their parents that they
broke the glass well the child who feels
emotionally unsafe they may try to hide
it they may pretend they may leave it
and wait for you to find it and they may
even lie and say they didn&#39;t do it the
question is this are we able to start
creating emotionally safe relationships
the short answer is yes absolutely
in fact I&#39;m convinced that this is the
essential next step in order for our
children to feel safe we need to be able
to achieve we need to be able to listen
and we need to be able to receive them
exactly as they are I&#39;d like to take a
moment to walk you through two different
scenarios
the first one is imagine yourself as a
child any age whatever age comes to mind
and you&#39;re in a beautiful garden and
it&#39;s green there&#39;s trees maybe there&#39;s a
jungle gym down the bottom there&#39;s an
adult somewhere in the background that
you know you can call on if you need
help can you notice what you&#39;re feeling
and you look around this garden can you
think of a game you&#39;d like to play now
I&#39;d like you to imagine yourself on a
sidewalk in front of a busy road cars
driving past strangers walking behind
you broken glass to the side of you and
there isn&#39;t an adult around that you can
call on for help what are you feeling
now can you think of a game you&#39;d like
to play here I&#39;d like to share my
experience of these two situations the
first one in the garden I was happy I
was relaxed and I was really only
concerned with how high I could climb in
the tree there was in front of me in the
second situation
I was nervous anxious I was on hyper
alert I needed to look everywhere only
game might have been able to play it was
one record sit very still and still be
able to watch what
going on around me when we feel
emotionally unsafe it feels the same as
when we feel physically unsafe keeping
ourselves safe is our priority
nothing else matters now happiness is
intrinsically linked to safety I believe
and has been my personal experience that
the lightness that comes with happiness
and joy is not available if we are
feeling unsafe and in fact playing
becomes very difficult if we don&#39;t feel
safe if our children are going to grow
into all they can be we need to start
creating environments of safety we need
to start committing to creating safe
relationships we need to be able to lean
into stable connection we need to be
able to trust that we have safe
relationships when we can do that when
we know that those are available we can
step into the world more confidently and
with more courage which is essential if
we are going to be healthy humans health
is defined as a state in which we can
function well emotionally mentally
spiritually physically and socially and
express our fullest potential your full
potential is only available if we are
feeling safe connected to ourselves and
to others
now resilience is also in the mixture
resilience is our bounce-back factor
what happens when life throws you a
curve ball do you disconnect retract
from the world
never to really reconnect again or are
you able to come back to balance
stay open to life and be willing to
experience what&#39;s next I maintain that
for the qualities of happiness health
and resilience to be part of our
children&#39;s lives we need to cultivate
connection we need to create safe
emotional spaces I&#39;d like to share some
of my personal story here because it
informs my passion of connection is the
solution so I was never very good with
emotions in fact up to the age of 25 I
did an excellent job at avoiding them I
kept busy I overachieved I was a
perfectionist and not very good with
feelings I had no I say no but very
limited emotional intelligence skills
when I was little my experience of
showing emotions was one where I felt
mocked and ridiculed and even ignored so
I did my best to shut them down and put
them to one side until in my mid-20s I
collapsed from exhaustion I simply could
not cope and I had no more energy to
live the fast paced skillful avoidance
of my emotions this was the start of a
10 year journey of me understanding and
discovering why my emotions are so
important how I need them in my life
how I need a pair tension to them in
order to thrive in this world and that&#39;s
safe emotional relationships has been
the foundation for my healing and growth
emotional safety and emotional safe
relationships have allowed me the
courage
and the grace to be exactly who I am
I&#39;ve never really felt safe in this
world and I&#39;ve never had consistently
safe emotional relationships until very
recently and because I have not had this
I really understand the necessity and
the importance of them and that&#39;s why I
feel I can speak so clearly to why we
need to commit to cultivating connection
emotional safety affects children in
many ways if a child is in a classroom
and they are feeling emotionally
stressed or mostly unsafe they capacity
to learn understand and communicate it
severely impacted he has an example if
I&#39;m if I&#39;m coming into class but just
before I&#39;ve got into class
I&#39;ve been shoved in the corridor I&#39;ve
been bullied I walk into class I&#39;m upset
I&#39;m hurt I&#39;ve got a lot of big feelings
going on it&#39;s gonna be very difficult
for me to sit down and do a math problem
we know from the research that has been
done about the brain that when we are
feeling big feelings our capacity to
learn and understand is impacted this
can display as different behavior and
children they can be angry they can shut
down they can be tears often this
provokes aggravation or frustration and
adults because the child is not behaving
in the way we want them to behave but if
we can change our perspective and
understand that this child is an
emotional overwhelm that they are
feeling and safe we can choose to have a
different response very rarely is our
first port of call to connect create
emotional safety and then address the
situation
how different would it be if first we
attended to a child emotional safety
their connection to us and then
addressed a behavior that we thought was
inappropriate we would see children
coming to us telling us things good or
bad I believe we would see children
asking for help and I absolutely believe
we would see children that were happier
healthier and more resilient to develop
emotional safety we need to realize that
emotions are deeply relevant that
cultivating connection is essential it
is essential if our children are going
to thrive a few weeks ago I was with my
god daughters and I was walking around
the kitchen with Kate on my hip hop&#39;s
making a cup of tea and I noticed how
curiously she was watching me and how
intently she was observing me and I was
struck by this crystal-clear
understanding and it was this we do not
raise children we do not teach children
we have no ownership here we are in each
moment trying our very best to be in
right relationship with them to model
how we want them to live in this life in
each moment doing our best to relate and
connect in our constantly shifting
relationship with them how we live how
we relate and how we connect that is
what informs the growth and the learning
of our children
it is time to start making connection
our priority as I end off I&#39;d like to
leave you with one thing you can start
to do in your lives right now that will
start cultivating connection and
increasing emotional safety they&#39;re
called emotional chickens step 1 find or
write the list of 20 emotions step 2
stick it on your fridge step 3 check in
with yourself at least three times a day
what am I feeling right now I am feeling
step 5 share check in with your loved
one or a perfect stranger I am curious
and delighted and intrigued to find out
how this changes your life thank you
