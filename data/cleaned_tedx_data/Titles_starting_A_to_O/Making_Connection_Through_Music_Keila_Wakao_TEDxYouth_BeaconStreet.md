one night when I was getting ready for
bed my parents were talking very quietly
behind closed doors feeling left out I
could only assume that their
conversations were about me I had a
feeling that they were discussing
something terrible such as quitting my
violin lessons or even taking my violin
my music away I had no idea what was
going on so I felt untrusted abandoned
and mostly given up on well my mom first
walked into my room I could tell right
away that something was wrong she sat at
the edge of my bed took a deep breath
and told me that my father had been
diagnosed with tonsil cancer I was
shocked and terrified at first the first
question that came to mind was will my
dad died my father is que cela cow
assistant principal oboist of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and principal oboist
of the Boston Pops I was so worried that
he wouldn&#39;t be able to play the oboe
again I was upset that I was just
finding out I knew my parents are trying
to protect me but it felt better to know
the truth right away in fact once I
heard that my father had been diagnosed
with tonsil cancer all I wanted to know
was how could I help a way of supporting
my dad may be different than what you
might think I acted as normal as
possible you may be wondering how does
it support someone well people who know
about my dad sickness often asking
questions such as how painful was a
procedure I could see a slight change to
my father&#39;s expression when people asked
him these questions bring him back into
scary memories and fears I promised
myself never to ask him about these sick
his sickness
instead I will talk about other things
until he got better I remember that my
father said that he loved music he said
he loved to listen to my violin so I
practiced and play my violin for him as
music sank into his ears I could see how
he smiled more and looked more
comfortable with every note he said that
he felt as if music was a small cure my
father was treated at the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston I was really
nervous to go there for the first time I
didn&#39;t want to see my dad sick in a
hospital bed attached to many wires when
we stepped into my dad&#39;s love room in
the hospital I felt more comfortable
than I expected the way my dad&#39;s team of
doctors nurses and even social workers
treated him well made me more confident
on my father&#39;s recovery even so his
cancer was very rare and difficult to
treat some days he looked much sicker
than others I didn&#39;t want to worry him
so I held a great amount of fear and
emotions inside but I found a way to
release these emotions through my music
his experience my emotions and even
confusion allow me to tell a much more
powerful story with my music worth not
could ever before life is full of
stories this one is mine and I&#39;m lucky
that has a happy ending my father is now
hundred-percent cancer-free in fact a
month ago I performed a small duet with
my dad I finally saw him by my side and
had the opportunity to share and combine
my music with his I feel like I have him
all perfectly back into place I found my
own way of supporting my dad which was
to act as normal as possible and to
share my creation of music with him I
want to inspire people even younger than
me to find their own talent to make a
great impact in people&#39;s lives
next I&#39;m gonna play a shortened version
of Zagora bison by
Sahra saute I toast this piece because
they reflect on my emotions I went
through this whole entire experience it
first starts off with a slow kind of
melody as soon rises up to a more
exciting tone which reflects on my
emotions right now I hope you find this
piece as meaningful as much as I do
thank you
