I don&#39;t have to tell you that
agriculture is facing incredible
pressures and increasing challenges all
over the world due to an increasing
growth in population I don&#39;t have to
tell you that climate change is reducing
crop yields by 25% year over year I
don&#39;t have to tell you that there is an
increasing demand and there&#39;s an
increasing demand for food growth which
will increase the demand by 50% of food
growth producing processing and shipping
moreover there needs to be additional
data analysts data scientists and data
agronomist and agriculture scientists to
work with the enormous amount of data
that we are being produced so enter the
2013 open data executive order this was
designed primarily to gather all the
available executive information and data
in all the federal government agencies
and put it out into a public form for
access by agencies access by the
American public private and public
organizations for development of new
products and new organizations open data
is the fuel which announces and
innovates agriculture innovates business
and promotes scientific discovery
agriculture and energizes the American
public by providing opportunities for
investment and population development
agriculture and open data also provides
public-private partnerships for you to
develop new and inventive challenges
such as the ones we are describing today
so I am going around I am attending all
of these meetings and I&#39;m thinking to
myself they&#39;re talking about data
they&#39;re talking about why there aren&#39;t
enough resources they&#39;re talking about
that they need more data scientists more
data agronomist more agriculture
scientists they&#39;re talking about 23.5
million people living
and food deserts that&#39;s areas where
they&#39;re not having grocery stores or
nutritious foods six point five of those
twenty three point five million are
children one percent of Americans are
only in agriculture or the business of
Agriculture so I&#39;m looking around saying
so what&#39;s wrong with this picture
I look around the audience I look around
my colleagues and I realize no one looks
like me
so I say maybe they&#39;re not looking in
the right places maybe they&#39;re not
expanding their reach maybe you&#39;re not
looking in the right areas for these new
agriculture scientists and agriculture
data analysts so I suggest what about
urban kids I grew up in West
Philadelphia I&#39;m an urban kid
what about urban kids that&#39;s the answer
I got are you kidding me urban kids in
agriculture have you lost your mind so I
go to my CIO Cheryl cook and I tell her
I want to do this
urban camp for youth she says oh of
course go forth and do but you have no
budget hmm the word no the word
impossible the words you can&#39;t do it the
word it hasn&#39;t been done here before
gets me really excited because I want to
prove that I can I will
and I&#39;ll do so I got a Coalition of the
Willing and got a group of people
together who supported my idea and we
went to the governance lab who was
headed by Beth Novak who you saw earlier
in a video and her team for development
of a curriculum in open data science
technology engineering agriculture and
math summer camp for youth we exit the
campus totally free we exist on the
donations of organization
sponsors and the component USDA agencies
so we had an open house invited
everybody who was interested in perhaps
enrolling their young people into this
innovative new camp the parents were so
excited free two weeks out of the house
my gosh sign them up now the kids not so
much oh my god they rolled their highs
around in their head they&#39;re trying to
turn me into a farmer not true so I
start out like I normally start out most
of my presentations they used to call me
the singing dancing deputy when I was at
agriculture I started out with a song
opendata will rock you so they looked at
me and I said open data is no longer no
longer Beverly Hillbillies and Green
Acres well I got the strangest looks
from the young people and even some
other parents and I told them go look it
up it&#39;s the first tenant of our camp
do your research I didn&#39;t tell them what
it was I didn&#39;t even explain what
Beverly Hillbillies and green acres were
but I told them to go look it up so they
did not only that I told them that I
showed them pictures of drones and of
flying machines and of New Age
self-driving tractors that run on the
Xbox operating system boy they were
absolutely fascinated then once they
started leaning in and I they started
paying a little closer attention and
then I dropped on them dumb money ball
agriculture business is where it&#39;s at
you get health care 401k benefits
bonuses when you sign bonuses if you
stay bonuses if you bring your young
people in bonuses if you bring your
friends to the table silence the next
thing I said was how much do you make
the average person with the bachelor&#39;s
degree in any discipline if they go into
agribusiness can make eighty seven
thousand five hundred dollars when you
graduate there was almost leaping and
jumping in the room the parents were
excited because they realized their
young people were going to be gainfully
employed after college and not move home
the young people were excited because
they were going to be gainfully employed
after college and not move home so we
had consensus they&#39;re no longer Beverly
Hillbillies no longer Green Acres so we
have self-driving tractors drones
tractors that draw our drive drip being
driven with tablets and joysticks oh and
news flash Google did not come up with
the first autonomous vehicle it was a gr
ICU l tu r e agriculture we are science
technology engineering agriculture and
math coding our camp doesn&#39;t do coding
coding is wonderful coding is good
coding is fine it has a purpose and I
love that there are so much interest in
coding but once you Cove
who&#39;s going to analyze and present the
data you have to have somebody that&#39;s
going to actually interpret the
information that&#39;s being generated
that&#39;s what our camp does our camp
exposes the young people to the data it
engages them in data analytics and data
visualization it raises their awareness
of data but not only that but of good
data management practices so I&#39;m going
to give you a math test first year of
the camp we have 30 kids second year of
the camp we have 40 kids five kids from
the first camp came back to the second
camp
three kids from those five kids decided
upon graduation in 2016 that they were
going to go into agriculture science
data science or Agron agronomy or others
types of data science so that means a 10
percent return on investment
the young lady standing at the podium is
a prime example excellent person just
fabulous came from the public school
system got interested in her two-year
tender because she came in 2015 she came
in 2016 into entomology bugs fine I
don&#39;t like bugs she likes bugs that&#39;s
okay she got a full scholarship to
Florida A&amp;M books everything paid for
she turned it down I know we did the
same thing she did her research what we
taught her how to do she looked at all
the colleges in the United States and
found that Bryn Mawr University
graduates the highest percentage of
female scientists in the United States
guess where she&#39;s going she went to Bryn
Mawr and she&#39;s a sophomore this year and
doing extremely well
[Applause]
we challenged their thoughts we teach
them how to think we ask their opinion
we advise them on doing research in the
part of their research we ask them to
create these what we call Z&#39;s or
miniature magazines that document their
procedures and document their journey
open data we went to on our from one of
our field trips to the District of
Columbia University of the District of
Columbia where they have the largest
urban agriculture rooftop garden in the
United States 145 acres right in these
kids backyards they didn&#39;t know about it
I didn&#39;t know about it what a life we
got them to find out where their
vegetables come from they picked their
vegetables they tasted their vegetables
they actually cooked the vegetables that
they picked this drew this was the only
camp of its kind with throughout the
entire federal system it drew the
attention of the White House and the CTO
Megan Smith after I left federal
government service in January of 2017 I
was approached by the University of
California agriculture and natural
resources they asked me if I could
replicate this camp out in California
anxious and excited to keep this dream
alive I said absolutely so we did that
we replicated the camp out in California
with cooperation of University of
California located at the Sacramento
City College they did the same thing
they actually went to a garden they
actually gathered the data they took
notes they debated the data they
analyzed the data they discussed the
data and in two weeks these kids are
able to use data and visualization tools
that most adults can&#39;t even begin to
think about using and produce these
storytelling infographics and electronic
posters so where are the people going to
come from that is going to help save our
climate as well as produce new food
right here right there right in our
inner cities
I have confidence in these young people
and what they are going to be able to do
they are our superheroes they are going
to be our plant breeders that are going
to fight plant diseases they are also
going to be able to boost food
production and help us with our climate
open data is the word open data have you
heard open data is the word open data
have you heard open data open data when
I say open you say data open open when I
say open you say data open open open
data will rock you steam camp hi my name
is Lea appended to party and we are
hi my name is Shannon Haynes Emily camp
I&#39;m boiling truth I&#39;m right here and we
are the food sustainability
hi my name is grace pan my name is Kayla
toy and the cold Danny we tire these
kids came up with their own topics we
pride them with an application and in
that application we asked them why they
want to attend the open data Steam
summer camp one of the answers was I
live in California and I&#39;m concerned
about water and drought and I think
coming to this camp will help me
understand what&#39;s going on in California
as well as what items or things that I
can do to help so these kids were based
on their essays that they provide to us
then we picked the topics that they are
going to be working on you can either
choose to grow and evolve or you can die
believe in your future I believe in
going where no one has gone before I
believe that you can trust the kids that
are coming along today I believe that
you can give them the opportunity and
they will grow and gravitate towards
them kids have a natural curiosity we&#39;ve
got to trust that if we give them the
tools the technology and the
availability they will grab onto it they
are our future
they are our lives we have to trust and
we have to believe thank you
[Applause]
