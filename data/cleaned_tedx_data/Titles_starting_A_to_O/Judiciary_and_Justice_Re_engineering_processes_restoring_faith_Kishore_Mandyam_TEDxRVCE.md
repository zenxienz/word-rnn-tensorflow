nine years that&#39;s what it&#39;s taken the
two wires to be acquitted last week it
took seven years in the lower courts in
Ghaziabad and it took another two years
in the Allahabad High Court and let me
tell you they were extremely lucky
because the average time a case takes in
India in the lower courts is nine years
the average case it takes in the
Allahabad High Court is nearly seven
years so they could have been in jail
actually they could have been under
trials for sixteen years instead of nine
that makes you worry you know the first
thing the Constitution guarantees us is
justice that&#39;s the first thing the
preamble says and here we are with the
problem that&#39;s not new it&#39;s a problem
that&#39;s been around for thirty five years
you know in 1984 there was a movie made
about delay in courts but unfortunately
the market for justice has moved on if I
can say that the market of justice in
India has moved to lots of other places
religious heads meet out justice there&#39;s
a Municipal Council in Mumbai who meets
our justice who runs like a shaka with
the court and of course there are the
cops earlier this year we did a survey
of about 50,000 people fifty thousand
households all over the country and we
asked them how they access justice
everybody knows this delay so people use
various mechanisms one of the things we
actually videotaped was a cop in Haryana
there&#39;s a very interesting case in that
part of the world there&#39;s a custom that
if a man dies an untimely death his wife
is expected to marry his brother and in
this particular case the lady had come
forward to the cop and said I&#39;m not
willing to do that so a cop went through
some deliberations for five years of
conversation hours of conversation I&#39;m
sorry I&#39;m using the judicial system
right for five hours of conversation and
they came back and said that&#39;s okay if
you don&#39;t want to marry your brother no
law that&#39;s fine but you know what your
two children who are young and need to
be educated they will still be the
responsibility of your brother-in-law
which is a pretty premature thing if you
think about it but you know I am a
techie I am not so much interested in
the quality of justice there are lots of
people worrying about that as the
quantity of justice and we went back and
looked at this particular issue we
started looking at this for three years
ago and we started collecting data about
how the judicial system works in India
we started looking at the high courts
you know if if you don&#39;t know there are
three levels of courts in India there is
a supreme Supreme Court which is the
ultimate arbiter there are twenty-four
High Courts which to look after
issues at a state level in multiple
states and there are about 21,000 lower
courts at the district and the lower
levels
so we started talking data from all the
high courts we started putting together
this data into a single large database
that we could analyze and we want to
come up with some patterns that Reichel
either justify or append some of the
ideas of solution there have been lots
of ideas of solution over the last years
and along the way we discover the
government has this phenomenal project
called the e court system which every
day brings up details of every single
hearing in this country I mean imagine
752 752
hey let&#39;s just double the number of
judges
really you guys all are looking to get
into tech are in tech you can&#39;t find 100
software engineers in this country in
time can you find 21,000 new judges but
let&#39;s leave that issue out aside just
look at the numbers in India we file
between 10 and 12 million new cases
every year nearly a million cases every
month and we resolve actually over the
last couple of years this system has
moved significantly faster we resolve
nearly 15 million cases but over the
last 25 years we have created this
backlog of 25 million cases so on
average it will take us another 12 to 15
years to resolve the backlog on the
other hand in the United States ok
I know the United States is a different
country they don&#39;t light a lamp on the
stage and kick off the shoes before they
come on stage yes I know we&#39;re different
culture but numbers are numbers right
the United States sees ninety to a
hundred million cases every year with
37,000 judges less than twice the number
we have and nearly ten times the number
of cases
there must be something we&#39;re doing
wrong but you know some of you might
think why does that matter like I said
earlier the market has moved there are
other ways of resolving justice why do
we need to fix the system right well
let&#39;s look at this cup that I was
talking about I have one question
where&#39;s the widow where is the woman who
raised the issue by cop rules
she cannot attend the panchayat by cop
rules the person whose life you&#39;re
deciding on can&#39;t be in the process and
look at what she was fighting look at
the custom itself how did this custom
come
this is part of the justice system that
they&#39;re going to how did this custom
come about the custom is very simple
it&#39;s about land when the man dies if his
wife marries his brother the land stays
in the family simple problem solved if
she had gone to the judicial system
there will be no question the assets are
hers
the children are hers she&#39;s got a deal
with them that&#39;s the big difference you
know the reality is the judicial system
is absolutely the only thing that is
fighting for our rights there is no
other institution nobody has accused
legislature of fighting for rights let&#39;s
face it right not the administrative not
the legislature the judicial system is
what fights for a right your your and my
rights and without bias and with
complete fairness you don&#39;t go out and
say oh to people from different cars
want to get married go hang them from
the other street that&#39;s not justice
that&#39;s what the judicial system does for
us so we&#39;ve got to fix this so to fix it
we went and looked at this data we said
okay let&#39;s try and solve the problem at
a very simple level let&#39;s not take huge
weights of cut-side this so let&#39;s look
at one simple set of Statistics in a
typical courthouse on a daily basis
there are 70 to 80 hearings that is 20
70 to 80 cases that come up in front of
the judge let me give you a sense for
that number
an average Bank support executive
handles 80 calls a day have you ever
thought the bank support executive has
given enough attention to your problem
so what&#39;s the judge to do it&#39;s very
simple first of all of the 70 or 80
cases fully 30 of them aren&#39;t even reach
there&#39;s this word that lawyers will tell
you it&#39;s not reached because you&#39;re
item number 56 on the agenda there is no
way the judge has the time to come and
talk to you so that&#39;s gone of the rest
about 35% we did the time and motion
study in multiple courts in this country
and we found about 35 percent of the
cases that actually are reached are
pushed aside because of administrative
issues paperwork has not been filed
warrants have not been delivered all
these issues which the judge has to deal
with and so finally the judge actually
hears 25 to 30 cases every single day so
he said we gotta fix this but where to
fix this with two major carry-outs
number one we are not going to ask for
legislative changes not just because it
can&#39;t be done I mean that will take
years but because we have to implement
something in the short-term that is
easily accessible so that&#39;s the more one
and number two will try and not change
the last mile courts have pathetic
infrastructure some of them don&#39;t have
bathrooms some of them don&#39;t have roofs
I am I would love to go to them and say
I&#39;ll give every judge an iPad it ain&#39;t
gonna work
so let&#39;s find something that&#39;s fit
within those frameworks so based on that
we came up with some suggestions we have
actually submitted this to multiple
courts and we are starting a process to
make some implementations number one
autosuggest dates now particularly in
Bangalore you guys will all be seriously
into technology you know what
calendaring and so on and so forth is
but you should watch the process in a
lower court the judge will stand you
know sit down go through his processes
for the day call up a hearing whatever
issues with that hearing solved and he
calls for the next date for that
particular case and he&#39;ll say okay today
is the 16th of October let&#39;s meet on the
you know 23rd of November so the
prosecuting attorney will stand up and
say well you know what 23rd of November
what works for me because my wife&#39;s
brother&#39;s father-in-law sister&#39;s mother
is getting married or some such thing so
I can&#39;t do that so let&#39;s make it a third
of December and the opposing attorney
would say huh third of December no no no
there&#39;s some other problem I had to go
to my village for a wedding whatever
yeah they are air it&#39;s not gonna happen
so the judge is going to stand up listen
I&#39;m going to take this let&#39;s just pick a
number I&#39;m going to pick a number 6th of
December done move on the pity is the
judge has no idea what he&#39;s got going on
the 6th of December because there&#39;s no
calendaring there is a register that
somebody maintains in relevant but that
level of detail is not maintained so on
the 6th of December guess what you have
another 80 cases just the way it is so
if we can write software for cars that
can drive themselves we can write this
software so we&#39;re saying let&#39;s auto
assign dates number one number two we
know the judge just know everybody knows
that there&#39;s a whole lot of time spent
on these administrative issues so let&#39;s
get people like retired judges let&#39;s get
them to do what we call non judicial
tasks let them deal with the
administrative tasks and number three
and this is kind of important in terms
of behavior change
let&#39;s incentivize good behavior we
typically penalize bad behavior that&#39;s
the government model and we are saying
let&#39;s go out and incentivize good
behavior
send out an SMS saying hey you&#39;re
hearing on Monday if you don&#39;t appear
there it&#39;s going to be 23rd and remember
whatever you know that kind of stuff
gives both litigants and lawyers a sense
that they must do what they&#39;re expected
to do I believe that if we do this and a
few other things we can actually read in
whole holy NL full measure like someone
said our promise of justice liberty and
equality thank you
you
