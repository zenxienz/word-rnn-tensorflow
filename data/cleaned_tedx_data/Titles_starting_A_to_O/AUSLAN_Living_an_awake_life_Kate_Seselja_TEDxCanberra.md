mom-mom the voice of my little boy was
calling me out of my sleep mom I&#39;ve had
a nightmare dinosaurs are gonna eat me
I threw back the covers and scooped him
up and began to walk back to his bedroom
I
he&#39;d seen Jurassic Park at a friend&#39;s
house recently I would have never let
him see it because he&#39;s too young and he
has a spurred it&#39;s so he&#39;s super literal
and instead of doing what I&#39;d done in
previous nights just tucking him in
saying it&#39;s okay
dinosaurs aren&#39;t real you&#39;re safe I
thought I&#39;m gonna come at this another
way
I said do you know what I think your
body was trying to tell you something
what did you need to do when you woke up
go to the toilet he said I think yes
that&#39;s right so next time you have a
silly dream don&#39;t worry about it just
ask yourself
why is my body waking me up I got back
into bed that night and my mind went
boom
I had just instinctually uncovered a key
insight into my life the 12 years I
struggled with addiction suddenly had
new context that evening was two years

into my recovery and there I was 3:30
a.m.
writing uncontrollably because I finally
was able to articulate why my addiction
no longer had any power or significance
anymore
