sadness is that there&#39;s a ninety two
point four three percent chance that I
will not get into an Ivy Lee school or
any other top-tier college for that
matter neither will you and that&#39;s just
the stats the good news is that neither
of us need to worry too much about it
and then the next couple of minutes I&#39;m
going to take you through why in the
past hundred years our parents I parents
parents their parents and even their
parents have come to believe that a
college education is going to guarantee
us a successful career we&#39;ve come to
believe in a miracle a university with a
lot of opportunities diverse connections
and a passage to success well all of
those things I picked up from a college
brochure now in the same hundred years
the world as we know it has been through
a radical transformation every single
industry that impacts our lives has been
disrupted at its root Peter Thiel and
fagged distills it distills disruption
into three simple words zero to one
take the transport industry for instance
uber ization has been able to put
together technology automated vehicles
and fast-moving transportation
technology to make sure that in New York
a fleet of 9,000 autonomous vehicles
will be able to take over all of the
cabs in New York to put that into
perspective
it&#39;s the fourteen thousand cabs that
they already own plus the 13 thousand
yellow cabs that we keep hearing about
in all the movies that we keep watching
but in the space of Education disruption
has been slowed and while there has been
some amount of change it&#39;s been
happening in small pockets
and that isn&#39;t too much of a systemic
change but there are a couple of
examples that I do want to share with
you which are creating a wave in the
education industry now the school that&#39;s
been threatening the position of the Ivy
League&#39;s isn&#39;t you Chicago or Stanford
or Berkeley the school with the lowest
acceptance rate in the u.s. is the
school called the Minerva schools with
an acceptance rate of 1.9 percent now
what sets this school apart not just is
it&#39;s academic program but the fact that
they are ready to continuously
experiment and change their academic
model and what&#39;s really cool in my
opinion is the fact that their students
get to live all over the globe
throughout therefore your curriculum the
next interesting organization that I
read about is a program that&#39;s been
running in Israel in hers Leah actually
what they have done they using the
concept of co-teaching so they have
professors and industry professionals
working together working with students
over a 12-month program which ends up in
a three month startup accelerator it&#39;s
cool because every single student
graduates with a startup that they&#39;re
ready to launch another program that I
learnt about is called osmosis now
they&#39;re working with the problem that in
the US and actually all across the globe
the amount of academic curriculum that
medical students need to work on is
growing bigger and bigger every single
day and they&#39;re challenging and working
on this problem in a very unique manner
what they&#39;ve built is an online resource
tool complete with videos and multimedia
resources integrated with the medical
curriculum so they&#39;re taking through
they&#39;re taking these students through
this curriculum in a manner that helped
each and every one of them now this is
really important because the dropout
rate for medical students in the u.s.
itself is over 10
is in tens of thousands and this is
particularly expensive for us colleges
because if there are so many people
dropping out they&#39;re still putting in a
lot of resources into the matter so
program like this is actually reducing
the dropout rate and making sure we have
better quality doctors available to
treat each and every one of us now in
India there&#39;s 125 billion people who are
ready to get into college all of the
college level right but only one in five
are actually going towards a
post-secondary education that&#39;s
approximately 125 million right and the
problem in all of this is that we need
8,000 more universities if we need to
accommodate all of these people and it
doesn&#39;t stop there
it&#39;s a qualitative problem as well the
existing universities don&#39;t have
resources robust enough to support all
of these people so they&#39;re producing
sub-optimal graduates who aren&#39;t ready
for the workforce and now that is a
problem that threatens us the number you
see on screen is India&#39;s current GDP
it&#39;s been at an all-time low since 2014
so if we want to see a change in this
number can we continue changing
education at the pace that we are the
answer is no will we need to pump in
more resources and more people into
getting in recruiting people into
post-secondary education yes and is
investing in brick-and-mortar college
and university programs the right way to
do so I think the answer is obvious if
we want to create a real change we&#39;re
going to have to invest in more more
projects like Minerva and more projects
like osmosis that&#39;s the only way we&#39;re
going to see a legitimate change in the
way we function
you probably aware that 65% of the jobs
of the future don&#39;t exist right now 45%
of the jobs that we currently hold so
dear to us and make money from are going
to be taken over by automation have a
look at the chart this chart is showing
you the top five companies based on
market capital in the past 15 years a
couple of interesting things to note
here in the past 15 years the power
shifted from a hundred-year-old global
conglomerate like GE to a company half
with sage 50 years old Apple in the past
15 years the number of tech companies
changed from one to five in the past 15
years the Mac market capital of the
company at the top increased by 43
percent now if these aren&#39;t stats to
prove to you that disruption is changing
our life today then I don&#39;t know what is
so in my opinion the three factors
driving disruption are technology
connectivity and diversity and I learned
about all of these three as I went
through a series of experiences myself
my and the people you see on screen
might seem unrelated right now but my
Spearin says tell me otherwise so the
picture at your left is of Chavira Java
she&#39;s the third punch of a village
called soda in Rajasthan it&#39;s based in
one of the most backward districts of
Rajasthan and she comes from the most of
really well-educated background and
she&#39;s chosen to go back to this well
village to work in her ancestral home
through my interaction with her I
learned about how she is using
technology to set up solar solar
generators in their village how they&#39;re
setting up Bank branches in their
village all with the power of technology
did I&#39;m sure you all know about no shell
caca he is the managing director
of McKinsey and company in India now in
the early two-thousands he predicted
that the IT industry in India would be
booming by now and it did but what he
failed to predict was how artificial
intelligence and automation would
threaten the employment that it
generated in the space of IT the third
point I want to talk about is something
I learnt and realized during a biology
class in tenth grade I know so I
realized that the theory of evolution as
we know it has been shaped by two very
important scientists but those two never
actually got to meet or discuss any of
these ideas so the picture that you see
on the Left Charles Darwin came up with
the theory of evolution but what he
wasn&#39;t able to put forward was the
factors that affected this most
importantly the concept of natural
selection on across the Atlantic Gregor
Mendel was working on the concept of
natural selection but he had no idea
about the concept of evolution it&#39;s safe
to say that a simple phone call would
have connected the two and would have
solved a lot of the problems that they
were going through my last point is
about how diversity is greater than
intellect every single time I learned
about this when a friend told me about a
Design Thinking workshop that they
conducted in their office a couple of
months ago what they did what they tried
was an experiment they put together one
team comprising of people from different
backgrounds they had artists inventors
innovators and students as well another
team comprised of people who came from a
similar kind of background they put them
to task and tested them on some simple
but very quintessential corporate world
problems and the results that they found
were astounding
what they found was that the team with
the diverse population and diverse group
of people outperformed the team from a
similar kind of background every single
time they came up with the more
innovative and more creative solutions
and that&#39;s a learning for me so what
does this mean for all of us it means
that the workforce arm of 2025 the
workforce of 2050 is going to be
different from anything that we&#39;ve seen
before but we cannot predict the future
we definitely cannot predict the future
of an industry so all we can do is we
can we can make industries
recession-proof but what we can do is
make individuals recession truth if we
build on skills like critical thinking
if we build on skills like communication
we are guaranteeing that we will be
ready for the future my learning here
has been simple doing Drive looking into
the rearview mirror the past is not an
accurate prediction of the future so if
they&#39;re going to drive looking backwards
we&#39;re going to crash at some point so
it&#39;s our job to keep looking forward and
to keep working on equipping ourselves
with the skills that we need for the
future and when we talk about success
and failure and if you are like me then
you probably had a tumultuous
relationship with failure you&#39;re afraid
of it you think that it relates to every
plan that went wrong every idea that
didn&#39;t work out but look at the people
on the screen Steve Jobs was booted from
his own company what Disney was told he
wasn&#39;t creative enough and Wilson
Hershey&#39;s set up three candy companies
before he came up with Hershey&#39;s now
here&#39;s where you and I would probably
differ in opinion you probably think
that be
some of the failures or some of the most
successful people in the world I think
that these were some of the successes of
some of the most successful people in
the world for a really long time we&#39;ve
come to think of success and failure as
mutually exclusive but what I&#39;ve come to
realize is that they don&#39;t exist without
each other
failure drives success to be successful
we need to be determined we need grit we
need we need to be power-hungry and we
need to be innovative but most
importantly we need taste of failure
failure is that one thing that&#39;s going
to give us new opportunities for success
and the most successful people grabbed
these opportunities by the collar and
shook the success out of them and that&#39;s
why they&#39;re where they are today so if
we want to be successful all we need to
do is make use of all the failures that
we have and use them as stepping stones
to get where we want to get to in fact
today it&#39;s almost more important or
equally important to visit a museum of
failure as it is to visit a museum of
science and in case you&#39;re wondering
there is the museum of failure it&#39;s in
Sweden so the next time you are visiting
please go have a look now this brings me
to an important point and an important
trend that we&#39;ve seen we&#39;ve considered
class toppers to be successful and
people with the lowest marks to be
unsuccessful we&#39;ve considered people
with better college degrees successful
and people who don&#39;t go to college is
unsuccessful we&#39;ve considered people who
go to who who learn from internships and
who learns from the best as successful
and then we call people who go to
vocational centers as unsuccessful
here&#39;s the problem none of these people
are unsuccessful in fact in Germany 60%
of the population goes to some kind of
an apprenticeship program in the USA
this number is a little less than 5
percent in India this number is unheard
of
probably in the probably in the
unorganized sector this number you might
come across this number students
especially students my age and your age
about 17 16 years old who could be going
to college work st vendors work in
retail stores and this is some form of
the learning but imagine you and me in
the same situation imagine taking a gap
year after after school and telling your
parents oh I&#39;m going to work as a retail
store employee they tell you your career
was ruined but that&#39;s the thing that we
need to change new forms of learning new
forms of Education are going to drive
economic growth and if we want to change
the way we see the world we need to
change this exact number we need to
change the kind of work that we do
apprenticeships internships job
opportunities at our age instead of
later on in life so what does that tell
me
it tells me that college isn&#39;t a
recruitment film just because you go to
a college it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re
guaranteed a job every job needs to be
worked upon every job requires your
skills so we need to stop believing in
the assumption that going to college
will be like approaching a recruitment
firm we&#39;re guaranteed a job the number
on screen is the number of people who go
to college who eventually drop out 50%
the unemployment rate for college
graduates today and underemployment rate
actually is 44% the average student
depth for a student in the u.s.a is
$30,000 so really all the only thing a
college education is guaranteeing you
is perhaps the skyrocketing student
death and a good probability of being
underemployed I&#39;m just saying so the
next point is that college shouldn&#39;t be
looked at as storm insurance you cannot
buy it and purchase it at one point and
it&#39;s gone not going to last you a
lifetime colleges are not going to have
your back for a lifetime think of it
more is car insurance you&#39;ll purchase it
once and eventually your degree will
lose value like your car insurance will
expire so take everything you do with a
pinch of salt so you&#39;re probably
wondering what the two pictures have to
do with any of us right now the truth is
that the reason that we&#39;ve believed in
many of the things that I&#39;ve talked
about all these assumptions that we&#39;ve
been making for the longest time is
because of a simple phenomenon
conditioning the reason that we wake up
in the morning eat three meals a day go
to school in the morning and then go to
college after we finish school education
is all thanks to this phenomenon
conditioning and the scientists of the
physiologist actually who came up with
this was a Russian and he came up with
this experiment and he worked with it on
his dog his the dogs they were circle so
what he noticed was that circus elevated
or every single time its saw food around
it right but after the cup in a couple
of attempts and in as part of the
experiment they realized that it started
salivating even if there wasn&#39;t any food
around what did what the dog was
actually reacting to were the lab coats
worn by the lab technicians who used to
come in with the food and when they
realize this they realized that it was
reacting it was having the same reaction
to the lab coat as it typically did to
the food now me you and Circa have a lot
in common not just about conditioning
but also our reaction to
food we like we we&#39;ve come to believe
that the the best colleges produce the
best people but we fail to notice
sometimes that not all the successful
people come from great colleges we have
to have to have to realize that while we
like to believe that the best doctors
comes from the best med schools the best
lawyers come from the best law schools
the best engineers come from the best
engineering schools and the best
entrepreneurs drop out of these schools
we have to notice that this shouldn&#39;t be
taken up as a trend in fact it&#39;s a
learning through each one of us with
because of these things that we&#39;ve come
to believe we work in a fashion that&#39;s
detrimental to our success we study
subjects we don&#39;t enjoy to get into
colleges we&#39;re not passionate about to
get jobs we don&#39;t love and then we ask
ourselves why we&#39;re failures in life we
need to change our perspective college
is not equal to success so we need to
find out how to make ourselves
successful without relying and without
being dependent on this institution
called college look at the people on
screen if you want to be the next Bill
Gates the next Mark Zuckerberg the next
Oprah Winfrey or the next math Darwin
then and if you manage to get into those
top 10% and the most selective
universities then you have to ask
yourself a very important question and
the question is really really simple
will you go to college and will you
change the face of this college or will
you go to college and let the college
change your face
thank you very much
[Applause]
