Jean Dubreuil oh okay
it&#39;s works sweet pants and comfortable
shoes solitaries and clock adjust it to
a local time that is not the most
important for crossing the borders the
most important things is to adjust to

the local culture it is around 6:00 p.m.
now but it&#39;s also it doesn&#39;t mean
anything
what the really matters that I&#39;m in
Poland now and I can&#39;t communicate on
the street with the locals in Hebrew or
Indonesian it will be pretty hard if I
want to understand them our grandparents
or even our parents they couldn&#39;t could
not imagine that it will be so easy to
travel around the globe just for few
transcontinental flights nowadays
traveling has become more affordable for
everyone but at the same time the
experience we get from travel is also
changed its became more spoiled by the
consumerism that promoted by the global
companies fast food industry and so on
my name is Bogdan Lachman nkow and I
have visited more than 50 countries and
written several books if you ask me who
I think I am I will tell you that first
of all I am a human I&#39;m a human because
regardless the country I go to time
zones I get languages and traditional
change I face I remain the same
everywhere the same like a thousand of
people around me if you ask me again all
of us are human beings but what kind of
human you are I would probably say that
I&#39;m a discover even all ends have almost
already been discovered
except for maybe
some sports in the Antarctic when you
have a chance to turn into ice most
animal and plant species have been
discovered as well so my grandma will
ask me so what are you discovering what
else can you do
and my response will be simple I
discover in people I discovered there
their cults and cultures in the short
moments of their life and believe me
it&#39;s priceless
it&#39;s ply&#39;s priceless to explore them to
get to know them and for a moment to get
myself into their shoes during my
travels I always try to learn the
languages reaching some level of
understanding with little knowledge of
language is also a part of discovering
not all languages comes to me so easily
as Italian where I can&#39;t just barely
string a sentence together
and once I in hitchhiking from Lisbon
from Kiev to Lisbon it&#39;s around 5000
kilometers and I start in Genoa on in
Italy somewhere near general actually on
the gas station and I ordered a latte I
asked some barman in the gas station bar
bring me a latte and he bring me a pour
milk because in Italian latte is just
milk
it doesn&#39;t contain any coffee and so
soon I found myself having a nap on the
table with a glass of milk and in front
of me there were two women speaks very
loudly and
the the next moment I was walked up at
the morning on the same table woman&#39;s
are gone instead I found two croissants
chocolate croissants near my face that
was a nice present because I was a
little bit hungry and after a while of
hitchhiking I found him my new friend
Patricia he stopped and took me to
general while he driving he was telling
me stories about city stories about
himself and everything was in Italian so
I can&#39;t understand anything but it was
with his Italian boys Italian gestures
you know and the way he was speaking was
much more interesting than that stories
I&#39;m pretty sure even and I don&#39;t
understand anything
so then Patricia dropped me off in the
city and draw away and I went around
just looking for some people talking
with them asking how to buy a bus
tickets how to find a Wi-Fi in
information center and so on after all I
walked into the bathroom and I saw my
nose in the mirror there is nothing
special about my nose except one fact it
was all over chocolate and I thought ok
I think it was pretty hard for my new
friend Patricia to give a tour through
the city for such a funny chocolate nose
guy and its woman in information center
there were laughing on me after I left
them was he looking for a Wi-Fi
he&#39;d better be looking for a mirror that
exactly what they said in in Italian I&#39;m
pretty sure and you know what a lot of
people tell me that they they can&#39;t
travel because they don&#39;t know language
so I have just a small advice try to
cover your nose with chocolate and find
a travel guide who speak a language you
don&#39;t know at all and maybe it helps you
to get over your fear of traveling where
are you going where you from
these questions are the most frequent
one around the globe sometimes that&#39;s
more important than your name even I had
been traveling a lot through Southeast
Asia and the longer I stay in each
country the more I felt like a citizen
on my own country you may bring a fridge
magnets postcards or some other stuff
but the most important thing you can
bring from travel is a fresh pair of
eyes not literally of course I mean a
fresh perspective on your native country
on the people you love on yourself you
don&#39;t need to be a Buddhist monk to see
the world through Dumont&#39;s eyes it&#39;s
just enough to take your shoes off to
step on the hot road and to hitchhike
from the point A to point B just on the
country you don&#39;t know at all once on
one of the Indonesian islands I met a
guy we said hello to each other and I
asked him vary from he said Prague
as a fan of learning languages I
continued and took it in check
unfortunately he didn&#39;t understand
anything I thought okay maybe my check
is it&#39;s pretty bad but in a few seconds
he told me well I&#39;m actually from Moscow
but it&#39;s been a year since I moved to
Czech Republic and it was a little bit
funny but you know what I am the
standard guy I understood him
once you come from a country where
people suffer from brothel repression
well the territories of your neighbor
getting next you come from a country
where hundreds of peaceful protestors
got detained you want to escape from all
these annoying questions you know like
oh man what happened with your country
what&#39;s going on there I understood him
because several years ago my country
vote for a prisoner as a president and
I&#39;ve got a thousand of such questions
around the world
so sometimes it&#39;s easier to say I&#39;m from
Prague because the chance somebody will
respond you in check is really rare
but I&#39;ve always saying I&#39;m if I&#39;m from
Ukraine and you know you know what I
always heard incredible stories in
response like Japanese couple which I
met on the minibus somewhere on Java
Island where light skinned human is such
a rarity I must say that everyone tried
to make a selfie with you like
Ukrainians who follow me on Facebook and
whom I met by chance in the middle of
the serta jungle like a Hindu doctor who
who were studying in Ukraine and I met
him just by a chance on the road in
Malaysia and he showed me an Ukrainian
flag and he bring this flag always with
him
so if you really get to know other
cultures you will find a new
interpretation and meanings even in the
most familiar things what was my opinion
about Ukraine before he left
for travel to Southeast Asia Asia four
years bad judge corrupt judge awful
roads inhospitable people there was
nothing to do there for a discover what
did they see then when I came back that
his people events and meanings are
underestimated underestimated by
folklore the traditional literature the
classical literature and magazines and
any other mass media being
underestimated and unseen they face the
treat of extinction before they were
even discovered project Ukraine er
launched by our group of volunteers aim
to change this through the stories of
ordinary people around Ukraine the team
of our 100 travelers is working on the
image of Ukraine what did they gain from
traveling they just met people who asked
them those two simple questions where
are you heading and where you came from
and this made them wonder why I&#39;m not
comfortable with dead questions ok so
what so unique in Ukraine you will ask
let&#39;s just give one example that poor
infrastructure and poor grain and
politics save for us a real treasure the
Roma language and culture in the most
original form the Ukrainian team visited
the Roma camps in each village on our
way we were warned not to go there
people say you have not been there we
were told that our car might even be
stoned there but we keep going
disproving the fears of locals who
treated us almost as a heroes because we
performed something they never managed
to can you imagine how much it worked
for discover the arch the arch of travel
is very deep one first steps of the baby
visit all independent festivals going to
work on the public transport transport
all of that about travels pressed
between the door and the people in
rush-hour
you know I&#39;ve I&#39;m in travel at that
moment as well you can always look for
an excuse not to travel but if you
really want to you have to try to feel
as a Discoverer
the journey starts from you thank you
