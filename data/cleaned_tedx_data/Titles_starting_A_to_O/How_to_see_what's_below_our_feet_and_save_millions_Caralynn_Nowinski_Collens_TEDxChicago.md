every day I get an opportunity to talk
about this new era of innovation were in
whether you call it the fourth
Industrial Revolution or the third
digital wave we&#39;re seeing a collision of
the digital and physical worlds this new
type of innovation is driving inputs
from lots of different sources lots of
things and lots of people and I believe
that when you bring lots of people
together we can solve really big
challenges that can have huge impact and
today we can do this because the tools
that we have I&#39;m very proud to be one of
the cofounders of UI labs for a tech
organization passionate about innovation
and have a fundamental belief that no
problem is too big to solve if you bring
the right players together today we&#39;re
getting inputs from like I said lots of
things lots of people this is giving us
an unprecedent opportunity to innovate
in new ways we&#39;re bringing together
devices and people in ways that never
dreamed possible before in the next
couple years we&#39;re gonna see over 50
billion connected devices so let me give
you an example of the kinds of
innovation that I think are possible
today let&#39;s take an example like
autonomous vehicles the big promise with
autonomous vehicles or AVS are things
like better energy efficiency better
energy usage fewer pedestrian fatalities
safer roads maybe you&#39;re thinking better
convenience maybe multitasking on the
way to work this type of opportunity
though is much bigger than the
technology it&#39;s also about how that
technology interacts with other
technology and how technology interacts
with people so let&#39;s take the
self-driving car itself the technology
is very innovative in and of itself
you&#39;ve got the GPS the sensors the
cameras these are the things that help
the car stay on the road not run into
pedestrians or other traffic manage a
speed limit and that&#39;s incredible
technology but the bigger promise is
really about connected mobility and
that&#39;s a problem that Ford can&#39;t solve
on its own it&#39;s a problem that BMW can&#39;t
solve on its own but when you bring
together multiple players you
can realize the promise of a connected
transportation infrastructure so now
let&#39;s imagine that same self-driving car
going down the road and imagine what
happens when it begins to interact with
the streetlights around it and so take
the street lamp that might be a couple
miles down the road and maybe that
street lamp doesn&#39;t turn on until the
car is actually approaching maybe we get
a little bit more sophisticated and that
street lamp actually is able to identify
that there is a parking spot below it
and that parking spot is near a retail
store that you know the retail store
owner wouldn&#39;t mind if that passenger or
driver ends up in their shop so now what
started off as a car company issue has
now involved the manufacturer of the
street lamp the city worker that
installed the street lamp the city that
owns the street lamp the retail store
owner and it&#39;s bringing all these people
together it creates a whole new set of
possibilities we haven&#39;t even talked
about the fact that to be able to let
all these signals interact with one
another you also need to bring in the
wireless network provider you probably
have regulatory and privacy and security
now
issues that you need to be thinking
about as well and you&#39;ve got federal
agencies so you may start off as a car
company problem and we&#39;ve brought in the
local municipality federal agencies the
local utility the light bulb
manufacturer at the retail store owner
and bringing all these groups together
now we can realize the promise of
something like connected mobility so
what&#39;s different why are we able to talk
about these things today we weren&#39;t able
to necessarily solve them or address
these big opportunities before well
data is changing everything I said we&#39;re
connecting everybody and everything and
by doing that we&#39;re creating lots of
data and where we couldn&#39;t collect data
before we now have really cheap sensors
that allow us to collect even more data
but what&#39;s more than that we also have
the computing power in the speed that
allows us to be able to make sense of
that data and doing so at reasonable
time and costs so now we can take that
data and turn it into information and
that information allows us to be able to
solve new types of problems you bring
all these new
types of Technology together data and
sensors artificial intelligence machine
learning I&#39;ve got all sorts of
incredible tools at our fingertips but
it&#39;s how you bring those tools in
combination with people and bring all
those people pieces together that
actually allow us to achieve greater
things than we were ever imagined
possible before so who has to be
involved in something like this
well you need large industry players
large companies companies who realize
that they&#39;ve got to redefine their
industry or be disrupted themselves you
need to bring together innovators
innovators might come from startup
communities they might come from
universities and you&#39;ve got to bring
these innovators and the game-changing
technologies together with customers and
buyers and partners investors you&#39;ve got
to look at what the small and mid-sized
companies the legacy companies because
these are the companies that have been
the lifeblood of the US since we began
and then you&#39;ve got to think about the
government providers as well who are the
policy makers that are putting a stake
in the ground saying that we have an
opportunity to do something if we can
you know provide the the landscape in
the environment for these types of
interactions to happen when you bring
all these players together you can do
pretty incredible things so let me tell
you about a project that we&#39;re working
on right here in Chicago some of you may
know that in 1871 there was the Great
Chicago Fire and the Great Chicago Fire
destroyed our entire city but you know
we are scrappy and what did we do we
built a new city on top of the old and
that has created a very complex
infrastructure below ground that even
gets more complex year by year we&#39;ve got
all sorts of old assets from fiber to
electric utilities to gas pipes subway
infrastructure there&#39;s lots of things
going on Beneatha beneath the streets
here in Chicago and while we do have
paper data and paper maps that show us
that unfortunately often the data is
inaccurate sometimes it&#39;s obsolete and
it leads to all sorts of problems in
terms of coordination and in fact every
60 seconds in the US alone we see that a
utility pipe is hit when a utility line
is hit that causes all sorts of
unplanned events and leads to about a
1.6 billion dollar problem
the value in solving that problem is in
fact much bigger because that&#39;s not
factoring in things like the
inconvenience to your life when the
power goes out once again so what we&#39;re
doing is looking at how can we create a
map of the underground that is accurate
that&#39;s responsive that&#39;s dynamic that
builds on itself over time and so we&#39;re
empowering first the city worker the
utility worker the construction worker
the person at the excavation site taking
their smartphone being able to take a
picture of the excavation site and then
that photo gets turned into through the
visual processing technology and
advanced computing gets turned into a 3d
point cloud that point cloud or that 3d
image of that virtual image then gets
transposed with visualization technology
and where you can actually tag the
assets that you&#39;re seeing so you
understand okay that&#39;s a water pipe and
it&#39;s owned by this person and you know
that&#39;s the gas line that&#39;s owned by that
utility and that kind of information can
also get combined with other sources of
data and those other sources of data now
when you apply things like artificial
intelligence can actually take the map
of one site and extend it across an
entire city block or multiple city
blocks so imagine we&#39;re talking about
here using artificial intelligence that
we don&#39;t have to tear up the entire
streets or the entire underground of
Chicago for us to be able to create this
kind of map but this takes lots of
groups coming together and that&#39;s
exactly what we did here in Chicago we
brought together groups big companies
like Accenture and Microsoft startup
companies like City Zenith universities
like the University of Illinois the
electric utility three city departments
it was bringing together all these
people that were required for us to be
able to create this kind of tool that
goes from way above in this in the sky
and can help us see what&#39;s beneath our
feet in Chicago who owns it what&#39;s it
used for when was it last updated and
allows us to now create a 3d engineering
grade map of what&#39;s beneath our feet can
imagine now having this kind of
information it can be shared across city
workers across utilities construction
workers and now we can better coordinate
what happens in terms of construction or
utility
work allows it maybe for those of you
living in Chicago if not heavier Street
torn up multiple times in the same
summer and you&#39;re thinking yourself
didn&#39;t they bother coordinating this see
them heads nodding so you know what I
mean there&#39;s all sorts of accidents and
delays that are able to be prevented now
because we have this kind of information
and this wouldn&#39;t have been possible
because this was a dream of a lot of
people for a long time if it wasn&#39;t for
bringing these people together to solve
this problem so innovations like this
are not exactly sexy innovations they&#39;re
not what&#39;s going to be the map the
little app on your phone that you know
maybe was created by two guys in a
garage we&#39;re talking about big
technology innovations these are
affecting every industry around us oil
and gas aerospace and defense health
care but what it&#39;s also doing is
creating a whole generation of
innovators outside of what we might
think of as the typical technology
innovator we&#39;re talking about empowering
not just people like the utility work or
their construction worker but the
machinist and the farmer and the
physician and the engine manufacturer
all of these people are able to come
together now and be empowered to solve
really big problems so imagine when we
can now go outside of typical tap cogs
like Silicon Valley and look at what a
city like Chicago that might have unique
assets unique capabilities what we can
solve and again it comes back to the
people
people ask me everyday are technology
taking away our jobs and I would argue
in fact quite the opposite these big
hairy problems are only going to be
solved when people in technology come
together in ways that they&#39;ve never been
able to before so as you leave here
today I want you to do me a favor I want
you to be thinking about what are the
big problems that you want to solve what
are the problems that now can be solved
by bringing together the technology and
the tools and the people and most
importantly who are you going to work
with to solve those problems thank you
so much
you
