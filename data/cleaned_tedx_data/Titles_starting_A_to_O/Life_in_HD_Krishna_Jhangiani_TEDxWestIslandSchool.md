what is happiness when I was a kid and
my parents asked me what I wanted to be
I wouldn&#39;t give them the other talks
like a fireman a policeman or a
superhero okay well maybe sometimes I
said I wanted to spot it out but most of
the time I&#39;d say it ought to be happy
I&#39;m 17 now and I love to be on the
screen you can see to focusing on the
left 15 and on the right just a couple
of weeks ago living like an athlete do
you see a difference in the photos not
really quite well I&#39;m here to tell you
all research shows that the top my
problems teenagers face today are the
following
drug addiction pressures from studying
pressure and relationships constant into
the good and lastly the need to excel
every aspect of life now to be honest
with you without still the same guy
wasn&#39;t 2015 I wouldn&#39;t agree with all
these things are probably say that these
the biggest problem that I&#39;m gonna face
for our teenage years
thing is another saying I used to be and
I see the world in a whole different
perspective and I hope to my eyes and
experience you guys can see these five
balls and the
daily basis has just a small problem
that has a solution
so last year during some whole thing I
went to India towards the end of my trip
I feel really sick a stomach ache and I
just didn&#39;t feel right when I came back
to Hong Kong I thought that all the
problems would slowly stop it
so like any normal teenager I continued
the gym and continued to play rugby and
I came to need advice we&#39;re not being a
joke or are we playing some sort of
spoils I&#39;ll get tired about up to five
minutes and see black patches all right
I thought that this was just because
unless that made the night before or
maybe a fitness levels that strong
because I enjoyed myself a holiday so it
was the first day of school
I&#39;m starting seeing a time right but I
wasn&#39;t at home
[Music]
so yeah and then I&#39;ll come down to the
hall personally something at the back of
my head
do the go to the go to the nurse so I
listen to the little voice inside and I
went to the nurse and after being the
nurse&#39;s office for about two or three
minutes I searched everywhere the
doctors that it&#39;s simple tests and the
doctor to me that call me is a drunk so
I was happy
yes one more day of school while and
that same night I found some position
for a p3 and I felt like I was gonna
explode so my mom wants me to the ER and
Alvin Toffler a week after being in
hospital system my parents thought it
was best if it just Chiquito symptoms
got worse and blood and I think
no energy at all so they took me back
out rated it was September first three
days before my 17th birthday I was
diagnosed with congestive heart failure
after that house wanted to Queen Mary
Hospital or as chief of pediatric
cardiac team of doctors I spent four
months in ICU and a tendency unit and I
had multiple operations
one being the insertion of a
defibrillator on the left side of my
chest keep in mind the operational under
menu anesthesia and I was awake
throughout the operation I can still
hear to play to the back of my head
sometimes and that&#39;s what scares me the
most the last operation I went through
was an alle operation and Alvarez in
that ventricular assist device it helps
the weekend that meant to pump blood
throughout the whole body it&#39;s in
someone&#39;s body to open-heart surgery and
suggestion see in the screen that pump
right there that&#39;s keeping me alive
today
the pump is underneath the chest as you
can see I&#39;ll open the wound on my chest
the wire leads up to a controller which
then leads to two batteries just to show
you guys indistinct about heart disease
in Hong Kong since 2004 in 2014
seventy nine thousand nine hundred
inpatient discharges and inpatient depth
of due to heart disease heart disease is
also the third most
the nineteen sixties and Asli public
hands going to rehab our patients as a
proportion to February of 2017 evening
the young as well so getting back to the
title of the song living back to nature
I feel after going through so much and
just operating I&#39;ve seen life so
differently I try to make the best of
things and I don&#39;t think that people
have to go through such a tough journey
to see life in the same way to hide so
today I&#39;m here to tell you how to live
life in HD firstly stop focusing on the
negative
when I was readmitted into hospital I
was supposed to be the books negative
life that I kept on saying negative
things and my doctors had given me six
months to live one day my daughter&#39;s
came to my room and told me there&#39;s a
solution is called and I was scared I
wasn&#39;t scared in his machine but I was
scared because my whole life change
could you imagine being told how your
life would be that we operated and that
you basically walk - and then at night
before going to bed before plugging in
for the charger plug exactly
how scared because I didn&#39;t know how
people around you around
however my parents react would they
treat me better or dissociating the same
I was constantly being told about all
these things that would be able to do
swimming not option continue to see a
bar not an option come on graduation
friends awesome option so why so why
would we talk about things that are only
able to will not be able to do so much
more than a hand right now will not be
able to get out get out
so stop that&#39;s when a little thinking
strategy change I complain myself stop
wasting time on the negative stop
wasting time the things you come because
there&#39;s so many things that you can do
it professor what you come secondly
always know that there is an alternative
I was really upset when my when my
doctors told me I wouldn&#39;t be able to
play rugby
and obviously it&#39;s very hard for someone
battery-operated next to machines to go
out in the field match but I kept trying
to come up with ways how to beat this
sadly it&#39;s not possible but I found an
alternative I&#39;m still able to be very
much involved
I&#39;m still able to sit on the sidelines
and watch a match and I&#39;m still able to
motivated day that&#39;s a lot more than
what I could do without the hospital
another example is my weakness
when I first thought to myself that if
I&#39;m gonna do this
I need to make sure that I&#39;m never upset
at the fact that I have this machine
sporting a lot so we worked my dad went
out we bought back we worked on the
design the interior back and we worked
in a week I made it possible for my
controller batteries and extra battery
spectacle is better when the bag is in
the works
supposed to be the happiest guy ever and
I was so happy because I would get my
sense of normality back I wouldn&#39;t be
happy to wear such a ugly background and
I designed the backpack which if anyone
of you saw me you would probably think
that&#39;s just a little backpack and I&#39;m
just as normal as you miss the next
thing never give up I never realized the
power of people towards the thoughts
when I was first admitted to hospital I
was such a negative divided
he kept on saying things like I want to
die
why Hamid is just stop why doesn&#39;t
happen means we can it just stop and
when I was able to hospital something
came out wrong
in my chest x-rays so my daughters
decided to do an echocardiogram on my
chest area and I was back at four
o&#39;clock and I spent about 45 minutes in
there those 45 minutes changed my life
begins at the end of it my doctors were
saying you&#39;re gonna die you heart of
everything you&#39;re gonna do pop minutes
left hours left hook things up and I
turned all this negativity into
positivity by telling myself and time
the people around such as my parents and
that family that I&#39;m gonna beat this I&#39;m
a strong guy I&#39;m still here to live and
have so many things to experience last
week carpe diem is the famous saying
seize the day if I&#39;m gonna be on to see
guys before going to this I used to
think a lot of dates were provided I
used to think that I would never be that
seventeen
Hospital and black taking away but after
doing all of this I&#39;m still able to
stand here and speak to you guys and
under that you gonna make the best of
every minute that we have you never know
what something could be taken away I
have learned this I&#39;m living life every
day in HD I wanna ask you out when will
you start
