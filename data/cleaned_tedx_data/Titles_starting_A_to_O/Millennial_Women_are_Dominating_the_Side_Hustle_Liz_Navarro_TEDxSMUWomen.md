1:24 awesome side hustles you can do
without leaving your bed or you could
listen to the podcast side hustle school
Chris biloba interviews people who make
money in all sorts of ways like this
woman Oregon woman gets paid to clean
animal skulls with flesh-eating beetles
that episode really speaks for itself so
we know that side hustles are trending
in fact a bank rate survey tells us that
44 million Americans have one that&#39;s
nearly a quarter of all working
Americans why are they so common money
obviously is a huge motivator we live
with stagnant wages and student loans
but even people who don&#39;t are intrigued
by money that can be made conveniently
from home online or in their spare time
doing something like driving for lyft or
uber or for entrepreneurs the appeal is
to dip your toe in an exciting new
venture without leaving the security of
your consistent paycheck or it&#39;s just
being resourceful with skills you
already have and using them to make
money on the internet but it&#39;s also more
than that when I ask people to tell me
their side hustle stories they talked
about a lot of motivators that weren&#39;t
money here a couple of examples one
woman told me that she works just eight
hours a week at her small local airport
and she does this because it&#39;s social
and she has access to free flights
another friend told me that she does
calligraphy projects for clients because
she loves to see their faces light
with something that she created these
aren&#39;t filling financial gaps they&#39;re
filling emotional ones why should we
care so much about this trend because
when I ask people to fill in this blank
I said side hustle for these were their
answers joy fun love freedom balance my
family myself so that&#39;s the part of the
site hustle trend that I wanted to
mystify today so let&#39;s look closely at a
couple of side hustlers full disclosure
I know a little about this firsthand my
first side hustle was a blog in my early
20s I worked in publishing but my job
was mostly administrative and my cubicle
could get lonely so I had a blog and it
was creative and social I had friends
start reading it and then acquaintances
and then strangers and to create and
grow something that was totally mine and
then have other people like it
that was really validating it actually
motivated me to write almost every day
and it became a side hustle when I
decided to monetize it at the time I was
sure that this passion was going to make
me a living
one dollar and fifty four cents of cold
hard Google AdWords cache later my first
side hustle was born and it died in
hindsight the blog was maybe a kind of
embarrassing Journal from a millennial
twenty-something and I hope that it&#39;s
buried along with the rest of the social
media posts I wrote before turning 25
but the side hustle skills that I
sharpened with that blog I use in my
career now and the spirit that
creativity and ownership that lives on
in the way I make my career choices and
in the way I choose my current side
hustles I do have a better example for
you though my friend Lauren embodies the
side hustle trend and in fact she&#39;s made
even more than two dollars with her side
jobs when I called her I said hey what
side hustles do you have right now not
do you have one but what are they by day
Lauren works as a filmmaker she makes
films about crimes against humanity and
she loves this work it&#39;s meaningful and
important and it can be dark so after a
long day of listening to stories about
genocide and violence Lauren goes home
drinks a glass of wine and her dining
room table and she becomes a stylist for
a fashion company the kind that sends a
personalised box of clothing to
subscribers once a month or she becomes
a graphic designer or a ghostwriter or a
photo editor all of Laurens side hustle
work is fun and light and it pays for
other fun and light things in her life
like her membership to her food club
those were some of her answers when I
asked her why do it her other answer
I have loans I work for a non-profit Who
am I to say no to an extra thousand
dollars every month and that&#39;s a good
question I mean really who is anybody
but not just anybody would stay loyal to
tough nonprofit work just because it&#39;s
meaningful but a hustler would my next
example is Sarah she&#39;s a side hustle
success story but it starts a little bit
differently because she was feeling
uninspired in her work
attorney so she started representing a
direct sales clothing brand on the side
because she liked the clothes and she
liked the brands mission to make women
of all shapes and sizes feel beautiful
the Sara&#39;s really good at meeting people
so she grew a big network and her
passion for her clients and the brand
drove the business forward it was just a
perk when her side hustle income
surpassed what she was taking home as an
attorney and now she&#39;s stopped
practicing law to pursue it full-time
she works from home she sets her own
hours she spends more time with her
family which is what she ultimately
wanted and now she&#39;s doing something
that doesn&#39;t buy her her and Sara shows
us that when people do work that they
love they do great work so we&#39;ve looked
closely at two people&#39;s side hustles but
what I really like about looking at them
is how clearly we can see the hustlers
it&#39;s kind of like looking at them with
3d glasses without the side hustle 3d
glasses we can look at Lauren and Sarah
and you would see that they&#39;re
hardworking and educated and
professional but put the glasses on and
we see them in another dimension vivid
passion creative business savvy
relentless dedication and isn&#39;t it cool
to remember that these traits don&#39;t just
belong to Lauren and Sarah and the
Facebook friends who answered my
question
they belong to 44 million Americans but
of those 44 million Americans there is a
reason why I highlight Lauren and Sarah
and that&#39;s because they belong to two
key side hustle demographics and we have
to look at the demographics to really
understand the trend so the first no
surprises here is that Lauren and Sarah
are both Millennials this side hustle
trend permeates every age category but
Millennials are the most likely to have
one in fact nearly 1 in 3 do and for a
generation who quite frankly needs the
money to pay off the student loans or
just to kick-start new careers or to
diversify their resumes they&#39;re flocking
to these jobs that are a poor
internet-based and that are basically
second nature to them Lauren and Sarah
are also both women
we don&#39;t dominate the side hustle trend
by a huge margin just a small gap kind
of like the small wage gap or that small
gap in parody there is also a small side
hustle gap so we know that women are
more likely to have one of these second
jobs according to recent job fate and
Bank Rate surveys they are also less
likely than men to pursue them out of
passion and more likely to have one out
of necessity this is the most true for
women of color
and this reminds me of all of the people
I talked to who told me that they side
hustle for freedom because a recent
hyper wallet survey confirms the 86
percent of the women they talked to
thought that they were more likely to
achieve equal pay by working for
themselves than by working for anyone
else so really to understand this trend
we have to look at the gaps it&#39;s
important to know that for every person
that I talk to who told me that their
site has two lights of fire in them
there&#39;s another voice and it&#39;s saying
don&#39;t glorify the fact that I have a
second job as a fun new trend I&#39;m doing
this because I have to because I have
loans because my job didn&#39;t flex when my
family did because I hit the ceiling so
it&#39;s not a perfect system let&#39;s go back
to Lauren she likes her side hustles
most of the time but she didn&#39;t last
Saturday night when she took her laptop
to a bowling alley bar she was there
because it was her best friend&#39;s moving
away party but she had a side hustle
deadline to meet and it&#39;s ironic because
remember Lauren side hustles are what
pay for her ability to do fun things
like go to bowling alley bars my friend
Natalie is one of the 16 million
millennial moms according to Pew she and
her husband are running three small
businesses as side hustles at any one
time and she likes the flexibility she
has to work from home but she also told
me that she makes some of her sales
calls from a closet so that the client
on the other end can&#39;t hear her kids
yelling in the background and I thought
that was relatable has anyone in this
room
made an important work call from a
closet and so if I so that comes back to
me last weekend my husband took my
daughter to the park because I need this
to stay home and work on my side hustles
the ones I took on for balance so that I
could spend more time with my husband
and my daughter at the park this is the
ultimate side hustle irony I asked you
why should we care about this trend and
here&#39;s why because every person that I
profiled today belongs to this key
demographic millennial women and they
present us with a fantastic opportunity
we can see with our side hustle 3d
glasses that they are savvy and
committed and loyal to important work
who wouldn&#39;t want an office full of
people like that and we don&#39;t even need
the glasses to know that this is the
most educated most diverse generation of
women to date we are outpacing our male
peers in higher education graduation
rates we are closing gaps in
traditionally male industries we believe
that we can have it all because every
woman in this room and every one
generation of women who came before us
work to make that possible but we and
millions of other Americans are doing
some of our best work on the side so we
have to harness this side hustle energy
and to do that I have three jobs for us
three tasks and the first way that we
have to harness the energy is that we
have to be aware of it so I ask you to
wear your side hustle 3d glasses because
they&#39;ll offer you an optimistic clarity
that allows you to see the passion and
the drive of your colleagues and peers
and future hires
and use the glasses on yourself find
what is fueling your hustle and use that
to be passion driven because it&#39;s how we
all do better and more meaningful work
my next task is to invest in a side
hustler side hustlers are fierce and
sharp and skilled because they have to
be to survive so trust their freelance
work by their services use their
products or offer your mentorship
because most of the people I talked to
were either looking to take their side
hustle full-time or to give it up if
only their primary job could meet meet
all of their needs so imagine if those
needs fun balance freedom passion could
be met with just one job we need to show
side hustlers especially young women
that there is a pathway for them to
pursue their passions and use their
skills and luckily I&#39;m standing in a
room full of people who know how to do
that my last task for you is to support
workplace policy and support culture
that supports women and men all people
all ages we need to support policies
that embrace diversity and adapt to the
changing ways that we work live and
raise our families because that&#39;s how
the side hustle energy can be harnessed
in traditional jobs and not just side
gigs that way people don&#39;t have so many
gaps they need to fill there are 44
million side hustle stories we&#39;ve barely
scratched the surface today we can see
with people&#39;s side hustles that there
are gaps that people are trying to fill
but we can also see the really positive
things that they&#39;re filling them with
with flexibility and fore-end fire side
hustlers are the real world response to
tough economies and underemployment and
boredom it&#39;s people of all ages in all
skill sets working to create careers
where their interests and needs and
passions are aligned it&#39;s 44 million
people choosing to produce instead of
complain 44 million hustlers moving
forward in the face of wage gaps and
glass ceilings and closed doors it&#39;s 44
million hustlers hustling on
[Applause]
