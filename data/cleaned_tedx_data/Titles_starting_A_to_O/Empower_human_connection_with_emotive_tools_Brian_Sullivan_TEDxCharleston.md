can you read this odds are you can&#39;t
because it&#39;s ancient cuneiform it&#39;s a
dead language but try this one do you
know what this says this is ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphics so you can be
forgiven if not some of you might know
the next one though if so please keep it
to yourselves because the next slide is
going to give us all a chance to redeem
ourselves the next slide I&#39;m willing to
bet every one of you will get right
regardless of your age your gender your
years of Education your linguistic
background your ethnicity your cultural
background ready what does this say yes
it says I&#39;m happy it says I&#39;m very very
happy doing whatever it is I&#39;m doing and
you knew it the moment you saw it didn&#39;t
you
why you knew it because we&#39;re hardwired
to read facial expressions to read one
another&#39;s minds to understand what is
going on inside of another person and
why is that because we&#39;re built for
connections but you and I know that
connections can be too hard to come by
and misunderstandings are all too easy
that&#39;s my grandma and my grandpa many
years ago when I first was licensed as a
psychologist my grandmother had a severe
stroke that stroke broke connections in
her brain and it broke connections in
her life that stroke impaired her
ability to speak and it paralyzed the
muscles of one half of her body it
paralyzed the muscles in one half of her
face my grandma could not speak or write
or even smile the way that she used to
and for several years before she died I
watched her frustration trying to
communicate her experience of living to
my grandfather to my dad to her daughter
to health care providers and even to me
I was her firstborn grandchild and I was
a clinical psychologist and I couldn&#39;t
understand my grandma over the years
practicing as a psychologist I would
watch my patients also struggle to share
their internal experiences with me they
hadn&#39;t had strokes but I was asking them
to fill out questionnaires to help me
get a sense of how depressed or anxious
or irritable or tired or dizzy or how
much difficulty focusing or how much
pain they experienced and usually they
had this type of format a line with some
bars and some numbers to try to share
with me what it was like to be them so
that I could take good measurements and
track their progress and their outcomes
in psychological services like
psychotherapy and they would struggle
and they would say I don&#39;t know doc
maybe it&#39;s a - maybe it&#39;s three who can
tell and they would take 20 minutes to
fill out a five-minute questionnaire
because they were writing stuff in the
margins trying to help me understand
beyond what this would provide them one
of my patients said to me doc I don&#39;t
feel in five-point gradations
he had a point as a businessperson with
my own private practice occasionally I
would have to order materials or
supplies and I would place an online
order and then usually I would get a
request with something like this after
the case asking me to share my
experience with the transaction and I
would struggle because usually I had
some mixed feelings I was satisfied with
the delivery it arrived on time I was
tickled with the service personnel very
very friendly very helpful but
ultimately I was disappointed with the
product and which of those was I
supposed to use this to represent I mean
this is like asking me how many rocks in
a bag did my experience weigh three four
five and how could I account for my
entire experience with this it was very
difficult of course you might say well
you had the opportunity to write it out
right they probably gave you an
opportunity to add some elaboration sure
but language and text are problematic
even if you know the language the person
is using to communicate with you you
know that text messages and emails and
other forms of written communication can
often be misinterpreted sometimes very
badly and that we can write one thing
and mean another by the way those slides
I showed you earlier before the little
boy they all had something to say they
all said I&#39;m happy well thank goodness
for emoji right emoji have come along
and emoji are the world&#39;s
fastest-growing language and they do
help because they add context to written
communications but there&#39;s a problem
with emoji as well emoji were never
designed to represent our feelings emoji
are represented and there&#39;s no science
behind them there&#39;s not even any
consistency behind them the emoji that
you send from your Apple device doesn&#39;t
look the same when it appears on your
Android
device and research from others as well
as from myself and my colleagues has
demonstrated very clearly that emoji
even the facial expression emoji are not
consistently interpret interpreted even
within one device or operating system
there&#39;s still a lot of noise getting in
the way of good communications and good
connections so witnessing all of these
difficulties I thought there&#39;s got to be
a better way and together with some
friends and colleagues using a little
bit of background in neuroscience and
personality psychology and emotion
science and computer science we develop
something a bit better this is morphine
morphine looks like an emoji but it
isn&#39;t morphe is different
we&#39;ve designed a suite of tools that
allow you to pick exactly what feeling
you feel based on the facial expression
and then to do something critically
important to dial in the intensity
because intensity matters because
feeling a little bit frightened is not
the same as feeling terrified and
feeling a little annoyed is not the same
as feeling enraged because our different
feelings and our different intensities
give rise to different emotions
different motivations and different
behaviors and that&#39;s critically
important so we&#39;ve designed a suite of
tools that capture a variety of
different human experiences different
feelings we have one that represents
sadness and you notice the numbers the
numbers occur in the background they
occur at the database level they don&#39;t
occur on the face while you&#39;re selecting
what you feel and how much you feel it
we never ask people to use a number to
try to represent what they feel we just
offered them a mirror that allows them
to say that
not enough that&#39;s too much that&#39;s just
right we call that the Goldilocks moment
and you know it when you see it because
you&#39;re hardwired that way we have others
as well how about that one
that&#39;s my favorite you I love that one
and one more
why have we done this because were built
for connections and because being
disconnected hurts it&#39;s been said that
all the muscles of our bodies are meant
to move us but the muscles of our faces
move others
we&#39;re built for connections
understanding is critical for empathy
empathy is the foundation for compassion
and ultimately for love and I dare you
to argue with me that it&#39;s more
important than ever for us to connect
and empathize and understand one another
as frequently and as thoroughly as
possible my grandmother did not live to
see this invention but I&#39;d like to think
that if she were here with us today and
had the opportunity to consider how a
little change like this could make a big
difference for a kid with autism trying
to learn to read and understand other
people&#39;s emotions more effectively or
other stroke victims just trying to
express themselves where businesses
trying to understand the needs of their
customers patients trying to communicate
effectively with their doctors or just
kids communicating with one another to
feel a bit less lonely and maybe not
suicidal that even if her face wouldn&#39;t
allow her to smile she&#39;d show us this
thank you
