good evening guys as you know my name is
Vic Dawson and in 2009 together with my
friend and rowing partner Chris mind by
the honor and privilege of becoming the
first and only boat ever to roam across
the North Pacific Ocean 7,000 miles
hundred ninety nine days 10 hours for 55
minutes to complete
not that we were counted
there&#39;s a theme that runs through that
particular voyage and really runs for
all my ocean adventures it&#39;s pertinent
for tonight and that theme is fear it&#39;s
pertinent for tonight because fear is a
single biggest catalyst from certainty
and fear run through everything that I
did really I&#39;d like to go through some
of the things we did to show you how
actually we approached that for our
dealt with it and how we used it to
achieve our goals as much as this was
the highlight of my pinnacle of my ocean
rowing career
it wasn&#39;t the start of it way back in
2001 when with my brother around 3,000
miles from Tenerife to Barbados across
the Atlantic Ocean
we were ex or former Royal Marines why
that stayed looking for something
exciting to do that seemed to fit the
bill
it took us 70 days to get to Port
Charles in the west coast of Barbados
two days before that picture was taken
we thought we were getting in just a few
hours on the East Coast approach of the
island thought we cracked it we&#39;ve got
hit by a major storm even today it&#39;s
still one of the worst days I&#39;ve had at
the ocean roaring office and we got
smashed to bits for 24 hours just off
the east coast of Barbados with a threat
closed and wrecked and just being
submerged by a big big old storm in the
Atlantic it pushed us eventually nor
from west of the island with nicely hit
it fortunately but it meant when the
storm decayed we passed the island we&#39;re
going to finish 24 hours before this
picture was taken we discovered that if
we both wrote together both it was Ryan
and Ben both row positions together we
could make progress back towards the
island 400 meters an hour for the first
few hours of progress but we wrote
together like that for 24 hours to get
to that point entry reports and Charles
were finishing our Atlanta crime the guy
had taken the pictures I took the
picture showers and said guys your
families are stuck in customs so do you
want to stay out here at all Thule
arrived I thought it was joking to be
honest that we went in and sure enough
there&#39;s a big welcome by but no family
go off the boat
I stood there I tell me it&#39;s way a taxi
pulled up her brother&#39;s wife and kids
got out I&#39;ve dad got out Carl give me a
zoo the first thing he said was
congratulations and the next thing he
said to me a son you&#39;ll never believe
the journey
Manchester Airport was have been honored
voyager nearly to start of a much bigger
journey for me
2004 saw began alone to push off into
the north pacific to see if i can become
the first person to row from japan
through the Golden Gate Bridge and San
Francisco if the theme fear runs through
all of my adventures on the year on the
ocean in rowing boats the thing with one
particular fear on that trip was a fear
of collision for times I rolled out from
the bowers of ships like that that had
just emerged over the horizon that the
pulling down on me didn&#39;t are there I
literally escaped 30 40 50 yards in
front of him at one time I came out a
week&#39;s worth of fog which brings its own
terrors not to tell you and so relieved
to see the blue sky again for over a few
hours looked over my shoulder and
they&#39;re right on top of me was immersed
container ship it didn&#39;t actually have
any containers on it so it was quite
while profile and it was right on top of
my unknown straightaway cuz I&#39;ve got
quite good at this get in front of the
ships I wasn&#39;t going to get past it
quick enough and worse than that I was
being pushed onto it this ship was 350
Foods of 70 meters long
its enormous I was gonna hit it through
a drag on the side got onto the VHF and
I said unknown vessel at whatever
position it was this is ocean rowing
boat mrs. D I&#39;m off your port bar
there&#39;s a risk of collision I can almost
hear the guy falling off his chair is on
watch immediately acknowledged the call
and turn the ship to starboard
unfortunately by this stage I was so
close
shit was now coming around to brought me
down I got back at the radio again this
is like stop turning to starboard just
stay on the straight line will pass man
he did I&#39;m pleased to say that the drama
passes ship pass before I safely passed
a few yards away and disappeared into
the distance but while this stage in my
particular row I have no communications
from day 12
so as bad as these incidents were they
did present an opportunity to get a
message on so I said to this guy he&#39;s
mine was a polyhedron for them from the
fair wars I said you couldn&#39;t send the
message I was my family could you just
tell the war all right can I ask you a
question Mick I said you know so he said
what you doing in the middle of the
Pacific the last thing that man said to
me before this conversation was all on
the VHF my mother saw it she disappeared
over the horizon the last thing Palio
said to me was Mick you English you some
crazy bastard as lucky as I had been
that occasion the other three occasions
on a hundred and nine days into the
voyage I look ran out I still don&#39;t know
exactly what delivered is in flat calm
conditions I was in the back having the
boat was rolled wasn&#39;t impact it was a
waiver to me however the boat was wrong
nothing wrong with me in the hatch me in
the cabin the hatch wasn&#39;t completely
watertight closed the water Henry&#39;s dead
and that stopped the soul for a moment
so what happened was as the boat went
around to come back up again the water
that got inside the cabin stopped that
working always inside like a vegetative
house to trying to get it to go all away
and it finally sat down on its starboard
side basically the front hatch was half
on the water
the rear rack was completely underwater
the only way to get that boat right
again was to be outside to be outside I
need
Hach that was going to effectively sink
one but it would still float but it&#39;d be
upside down it was the end of the run
doors of a survival situation everything
from there on was basically quite scared
I cope with most of it fairly well which
is why I&#39;m here today to speak to you
but there were two occasions during that
whole period when really was almost all
done by fear the first time was when I
decided after about 15 hours with the
one hours that I was going to get out of
the cabin I was slowly going over it was
going to go over and the following night
I thought I don&#39;t want to be in here
trying to escape in the dark I&#39;m gonna
get out and do my own thing and that
meant open in the floating the cabin
unfortunately warmer in background I&#39;ve
done Duncan draws helicopter dunking
drugs so it prepared me to a certain
extent what was to come once basically
when I send me like a hips also rolls
over when you&#39;re inside you I&#39;m gonna
hatch out and then you swim to freedom
pretty much what I was going to have to
do in this in this rowing boat so I got
myself ready bird myself someone or so
on and I opened the hatch my first
thought was Mick this is a really bad
idea
freezing North Pacific Ocean immediately
rushed it transformed my life to chaos
and I could not get out I had to stay
calm if I don&#39;t panic that up stage I
would have never got out of that cabin
and I remain pushed up against the back
of the boat does it fully turn turtle
there&#39;s water rushed in freezing cold
water got hit with cold water shock
reach that gasping for air try to
control this all the time trying to stop
myself going for that apps that I could
never go through because there&#39;s almost
in water I&#39;ve got to the stage bracing
with a bow upside-down the last few
inches of air and disappearing out the
cabin I thought well my dialect oh
basically gave in to the panic room for
the hatch
outside just with my life raft set the
life raft ups or backside fortunes to
get air from quite honest
and then basically waited for rescue
which I thought would take four days
it&#39;s very relieved to be out there until
it got dark I - I wouldn&#39;t up the side
of the boat itself on the boat the
previous night so a Norse at a four foot
by three foot life raft at the side of
the boat in the pitch-black
I was very alarmed when something
started smashing into the bottom of my
life raft I literally remember the hairs
on the back of my neck Donal but all I
wanted to do was jump up life raft Jill
wanted up turned all the Roman boat but
I was next to stand up might tip Tigers
and get far away from that walk was
possible I&#39;ve been pretty stupid
especially if I were realizing was
actually not a shark that&#39;s hit the
bottom of the boat it was yours come
loose with the say myself get a grip
mate because if you&#39;re panicking at this
what are you going to do when it&#39;s a
real shark
fortunately I didn&#39;t have to wait for a
real shark or because I have to wait for
four days to rescue an aircraft from
Alaska who I brought ship to me within
22 hours miss me the first time I passed
me less than hundred yards away couldn&#39;t
see me in the darkness was redirected by
the ship came about the second time I
was halfway down the side of it
whispers Sean everything
in that situation they finally solve
integrated container ship oh I got the
right one two Me&#39;s and we&#39;ve got you
fantastic event but we&#39;re going too fast
so we&#39;re gonna have to go turn around
and come and get you again
well it&#39;s progress but unfortunately as
I then proceeded to drift to the back of
the ship or a terrific pass drifted past
me there was an explosion
whitewater lifted in the wall lifted out
from the back of the ship where it came
down the ocean table lifted the Ryan
Bowman to me
shredding my life raft threw me into the
water as a ship was disappearing for the
third time John wick - as a ship was
disappearing for the third time I was
now treading water for England with my
wife raft I clambered onto the upturned
halt the more I embarked and hung onto
the rudder and it eventually turned
around and Rowney down that&#39;s the only
way he could get close enough to me to
get me alongside I bounced down the side
of that ship what some sort of maritime
Romeo rider and eventually got to a rope
ladder that they put down jumped off the
ball of the bar onto the rope and watch
my boat disappear into the night and the
North Pacific and then I clambered about
70 feet look there&#39;s my salvation now I
tell that story so that I can emphasize
that fear is a part of everything that
you do it&#39;s coconut it&#39;s the the issue
not not the fact that you&#39;ve got it
don&#39;t be afraid to be afraid just make
sure that react to it
react to it effectively and when I got
off all I wanted to do is go back
there&#39;s nothing about that experience
that told me I couldn&#39;t go across the
Pacific and become the first person to
to reach San Francisco the raw have been
fantastically successful I&#39;ve become
unlucky I&#39;m a freakish die about 109
days into the trip more importantly when
otherwise how hard coped with a rescue
situation with the capsized situation
I&#39;ve dealt with that well so when I
looked at all go back I chose to go back
there&#39;s one small problem another bunt
when I got back to England was offered a
job by these people
the Atlantic Rio my sister you remember
this voice the movie Oh James Cracknell
can bend the phone we were in em I did a
documentary always a safety captain for
this part of the job description is that
I could build a boat to go back to the
North Pacific Hill the part that job was
to go to like a mirror in the Canary
Islands and basically be the safety
skipper for the early stage of the race
and bring people back in which is
exactly what I did I brought one of the
boats back any first night two guys came
back in tight a move of the boat one
French go and Howie other guy stayed and
long story short he basically said if
somebody with some experience I could
get across this Iceland I agreed with
him I also thought a row across the
Atlantic could be good trying to infer
going back to the North Pacific
so got his bio jumped on his boat six
days after the race the rest of the the
race fleet set off we chased after him
and right across the Atlantic Ocean we
got into Antigua as a destination for
that row in 60 days I thought it&#39;d be a
good training run it was it was the
worst weather on that road for a hundred
years 26 points it took 17 of them
including us was capsized at one stage
or another all of themselves right after
say six boats lost completely no crew
I&#39;m pleased to say as well so much on
that round the most important thing on
earth was going back to the North
Pacific as a double would make it much
more likely to be successful than going
on my own
to that end Chris my enemies in that
race as a solo robber I went to see
Chris and I said you folks he got across
a little wise enough to ask Chris to
join me and Chris was fool enough
foolish even enough to agree and we went
to Japan in 2009 as a double now people
ask me what the difference between that
transatlantic
the tribe wins and the North Pacific the
easiest way I can describe by his own
urge anybody who wants to roll an option
to go and do that Atlantic biomass
anybody it&#39;s fantastic I wouldn&#39;t any to
go at the North Pacific because that
place will kill you it is a world of
difference from that warm weather trade
winds rule across the Atlantic it&#39;s
hostile it&#39;s our style from the many
people leave all the way across its vast
it&#39;s 4 and 1/2 thousand mile distance to
San Francisco but we roamed nearly 7,000
miles then we were passing the same
place frequently three times before we
left it beyond the storms are big you&#39;ve
got the typhoons on the Japanese side
and you&#39;ve got the Hurricanes on the
American side they were all number of
navigational hazards to go across when
we set off we immediately landed in a
fleet of 50 fishing boats just off the
Japanese card ships trawlers everything
that you&#39;ve ever seen this but the whole
boy fighting my way through Chris said
at the end of it after that we got
halfway across and we found ourselves in
a huge Eddy 100 miles across swinging
around and we were stuck in it initially
going the right way and then it started
to hang south and we have to get out so
the thoughts and to save the whole world
because we&#39;d have gone back to the 300
mold back to Japan we punched out from
this Eddy and found ourselves in
basically a forest of sea mountains just
below the surface some of them are 11
meters beneath the surface of the ocean
it&#39;s the extension in Hawaiian Islands
it was absolutely terrifying the floor
of the sea is normally four miles
beneath you suddenly we had rocks
11 meters belongs 80 meters below us and
we were picking our way through it was
constant terror and fear we even add
fire on board an electrical fire my sort
of smoke fortunately if you ever get the
chance to crisp speak about
very flattering he says I saved his life
strictly true and the art to tell him I
was actually trying to get his
wristwatch off when he woke up we got
through that and the one thing about
that North Pacific Pacific trip more
than any other trip one fear that pulled
over all the time the worst fear of all
my my view is a fear of failure
that&#39;s a worst fear because it doesn&#39;t
exist it&#39;s a constant it&#39;s in your mind
the other fears are something you&#39;ve got
to deal with fear of failure that&#39;s a
very modern fear and it will stop you
even trying at its worst with failure
the fear of failure for me put it behind
you imagine it&#39;s trying to capture or
driving me towards ego never put it in
front of you because it will just become
a hurdle for you to get out of maybe
other than the crank over so fear of
failure especially in the last six weeks
of that run was hanging over was like a
sledge hammer we were 25 kilos lighter
than we set off we were like food we&#39;d
lost the race to beat the winter in to
San Francisco and we were out on the
North Pacific in October going into my
phone we were riding two hours on two
hours off around the clock utterly
exhausted literally within sight the
American Coast and we still didn&#39;t know
if we were going to get in but we had
two really important weapons on board
that boat we were passionate about
passions of one of those weird words but
passionate passion is is it means you&#39;ve
got fuel to achieve your goals if you&#39;re
not passionate about something then you
won&#39;t achieve your goal if you are then
you will we were passionate and we have
belief a belief is key because belief
will eradicate from
and we are belief in ourselves belief in
each other an absolute belief that we
were going to get this boat to the
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
that&#39;s it as we approach the American
coast I still didn&#39;t know if we were
going to get in there we&#39;re going to to
a point called Point Reyes and as we
were heading towards it literally within
sight of it we were being pushed too far
south to make the Golden Gate Bridge
which was 30 miles in sure of it and
then the wind shaft the wind was never
in our favor the hole that that Harari
occasionally went behind us but he never
went exactly the way we wanted and when
we within within two hours of definitely
not making the Golden Gate Bridge that
wind came around and came directly
behind us and gave us a chance to get in
as we got around one Dreyer&#39;s after
surfing in front of these 25 mile an
hour wind past Point Reyes we found
ourselves back to a fishing boat drove
alongside us big segment you guys okay
around the other side we fall I went
Japan they put his window up and drove
off he didn&#39;t believe us but the
following day we ended up beneath the
Golden Gate Bridge it was a epic journey
of over six and half months every chance
that weird out along that way I overcome
it plotted the course to get into that
bridge now what I want to leave you with
is a very important lesson that I
learned fear is not a bad guy it&#39;s not
going to trip it all well if it can but
it&#39;s not there de tributo
if you embrace it if you acknowledge it
and you use it to teach you lessons out
of current situations it will put a
course to you to your own particular
Golden Gate bridges fear is not the
enemy fear as a missile
[Applause]
