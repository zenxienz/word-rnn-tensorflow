a little over five years ago I took a
position as the technical editor at a
new Japanese graduate university and was
able to continue doing my own research
on the side as well
as a result of my new professional
responsibilities I began looking at the
technical literature the scientific
literature in a much more critical way
than I ever had before and in so doing I
came to a conclusion that really
astonished me most of the figures in the
scientific literature are absolutely
awful how is it that scientists who are
generally speaking passionate about what
they do are so bad about communicating
their results to other people well there
are probably a lot of reasons one is
that few among us have ever had any
formal training whatever in technical
writing or in graphic arts which are
core skills for those of us who exist in
a publisher perish world the other thing
is we learned from our postdoctoral
advisers who learn from their
postdoctoral advisers and so on it goes
until you arrive back at the
neanderthals edging things on cave walls
now if you think that&#39;s a bit hyperbolic
it&#39;s really not because when we look at
photographs of their drawings we think I
wonder what they did that for or what
does that mean to them and let&#39;s face it
that&#39;s the same question we asked when
we read a lot of the scientific
literature what does that mean and we
don&#39;t have any idea and in fact in my
own research I was having to go into
fields that I had never worked in before
so I was venturing well beyond familiar
territory to myself so this view of
science was very much enhanced so let&#39;s
take a look at some of the problems and
also some of the process and some of the
solutions now in a 15-minute talk I
can&#39;t possibly begin to talk about all
the different kinds of graphics that we
use in the sciences so I hope that
you&#39;ll forgive me for using a very small
subset
here&#39;s an example these are tube gels
probably most of you have never seen
these things but believe it or not when
I started my career these were
state-of-the-art technology and I use
them in my master&#39;s degree they were
awful I&#39;m sure glad we don&#39;t do that
anymore if you look at this figure you
can see that many of the bands on the
gels have been labeled the legend which
I wouldn&#39;t try to read gives many
details about the samples that were
applied and the conditions of the gels
so what&#39;s wrong with that well the one
thing it doesn&#39;t do is the only thing
that&#39;s really important it doesn&#39;t tell
you what the science means there is no
take-home message whatsoever from this
figure and this by the way was published
in one of the most prestigious
scientific journals in the world today
many people will tell you that a figure
legend should not repeat material that
is in the text malarkey a well written
figure legend should be independent of
the text the reader shouldn&#39;t have to go
back and reread large sections of the
paper to try to figure out what he&#39;s
looking at how many of you have had to
do exactly that don&#39;t make the readers
go back to the text and above all else
explained the scientific significance of
the data why did you make this figure
not just to get the publication in a
particular journal you had an idea that
you wanted to communicate what was it
now here&#39;s a figure that was published
by a colleague of mine from Brazil the
first legend was one that I made up
specifically to show you where some of
the problems are this legend tells you
that there is a relationship between the
dose of the essential oil of a plant
called Croton Zentner I and mean
arterial pressure and heart rate in what
we&#39;re not told okay in other words all
you&#39;re told is that there is a
relationship but it doesn&#39;t tell you
what it is
many many figure legends are just like
this they really don&#39;t tell you anything
useful
the second example was basically what
came out of the paper
increasing intravenous bolus doses of
essential oil of proteins
and it&#39;s two major components anetha
land Esther goal at doses of five ten
and twenty milligrams per kilogram
evoked immediate and dose dependent
decreases in mean arterial pressure and
heart rate in male with star rats and
you&#39;ve even got the statistics okay when
you look at the figure it&#39;s immediately
obvious what&#39;s going on you can see the
drop in arterial pressure and heart rate
with increasing doses you don&#39;t have to
spend a lot of time looking at the
figure you got the main message right
off the bat this is a good way to do it
here&#39;s another one taken from our
institution both n-terminal and
c-terminal regions are required for SI
not three dependent mrna decay if you
want to read all the details you can but
you already got the main message note
that the main message was put right in
the figure legend title you didn&#39;t have
to read the whole legend to get to it
it is a short declarative sentence in an
active voice if you got the message you
can move on so when you set about
creating scientific figures present your
data in the most intuitive possible way
be creative and don&#39;t just do it the way
everybody else does it because that&#39;s
the way they do it an old adage says
that a picture is worth a thousand words
and that is certainly true perhaps even
more in the sciences and above all else
don&#39;t ever use a table where a figure
can be employed instead why is that it&#39;s
because human beings are extraordinarily
good at spotting and understanding
patterns but looking at a mass of data
in a table doesn&#39;t do anything for us
let me show you what I mean
okay this is about one sixth of this
table what is it well okay I guess I owe
you that explanation when I took this
job it was really sort of a dream come
true in that all my life I&#39;d wanted to
have a job where I could either walk to
work or ride a bicycle to work and so
this was my golden opportunity so I went
out and bought a carbon fiber road bike
that cost Martha more than my car I&#39;m
sure you&#39;re really impressed with that I
probably shouldn&#39;t tell you as a 13 year
old
but anyway I got a good bicycle and
started writing to work and I thought
well as long as I&#39;m at it I might as
well record my mileage just to see where
I&#39;m at at the end of the year so I did
but the point is that when you look at
this data the pattern in the data it
just doesn&#39;t jump out and grab you you
can&#39;t make any sense of it but when it&#39;s
plotted in a graph it&#39;s a totally
different story now you can see the
climbing kilometers by the Green Line
there there are level spots where I
didn&#39;t ride because of typhoons or
traveling or other obligations you can
see the daily mileages as dots scattered
all over the graph and there were sure a
lot of days across the x-axis where I
didn&#39;t ride at all and I ended up with
almost 8,000 kilometers on the year
which for a 60 year old guy wasn&#39;t too
bad at least I figured I would make it
to 61 if I could keep doing that I&#39;m not
sure how much far longer this is gonna
work but anyway so you can see the
patterns in the data very very easily
once they&#39;re plotted but not when
they&#39;re in a table please promise me you
will never ever do this do not ever use
a 3d bar chart for 2d data that kind of
fluff is for business graphics and maybe
for journalism where superficial stuff
is more important than real substance
and in the sciences this is actually a
problem because when you look at this
graph you can&#39;t tell where those columns
intersect the y-axis this kind of a
graph actually obscures information
rather than transmitting it so don&#39;t do
it here&#39;s another good bad example you
notice that there&#39;s a very lengthy
figure legend this is an
electrophysiological figure and a
colleague of mine who was an
electrophysiologist spent quite a while
looking at this before we she was kind
of sort of able to explain it to me I
never did get it part of the problem is
the axis labels I&#39;m not sure what P of T
is and I&#39;m not sure that anybody could
glean it very easily from the figure
legend bad way to do things what were
they thinking now
these bad examples that follow are my
own no we never use these in an actual
publication we were trying to compare
two habu species
southern Okinawa in terms of the
composition of their venom gland
transcriptomes the problem was that the
different transcripts varied by more
than six orders of magnitude in
abundance
that&#39;s a difficult graphing problem so
we first tried putting the abundant ones
on scaled one way on the top and then we
scaled them a different way on the
bottom graph and it just didn&#39;t work if
you put the most abundant ones on scale
you couldn&#39;t see the less abundant ones
and if you did the reverse and
everything else was off scale on the top
we also used identical figure our x-axis
labels which didn&#39;t tell you anything
we used a and B which meant that the
reader then had to refer to the legend
to try to figure out what was being
plotted this was a loser right from the
get-go so we also toned down the lurid
colors got rid of the a and B came up
with new x-axis labels but the
underlying problem was still there we
just couldn&#39;t get everything on scale so
that made sense so one of my
collaborator said well that&#39;s easy
use a logarithmic graph so we did okay
everything&#39;s on scale but the problem is
that human beings don&#39;t see things
logarithmic ly you don&#39;t try to gauge
distances by powers of 10 we look at
things arithmetic aliso yes everything&#39;s
on scale but it&#39;s collapsed all the
differences and so this really doesn&#39;t
communicate very well at all in the end
the answer was that sometimes less is
more we threw out the minor components
and graphed only the major ones and then
when you look at these two plots you can
see boy those two Venom&#39;s really are
different we plotted only the major
components and it was immediately
obvious how they differed and of course
when you think about it it&#39;s the major
components that determine what the venom
does much more than the minor ones so
biologically this made sense also few
years later we had the same problem this
time I arrived at a different solution
these were venom gland transcriptomes
from six brazilian coral snakes we
plotted all the major components in the
upper panel that is those were 2 percent
or more of the the transcriptome and
what was left over we plotted in black
so
those little black segments at the top
are then represented in the bottom panel
by the minor components and on top of
all else not only did it communicate
better but it was kind of pretty too
best looking graph I ever made so I was
happy with it
this plot a Venn diagram also makes good
use of color it&#39;s easy to see the
overlaps the numbers indicate what the
office wanted to communicate the problem
is the labeling of the ellipses in the
Venn diagram and the figure legend don&#39;t
tell you very much about this this had
to do with species of fungi that were
and were not cultivated by leaf cutting
ants in the tropics and so even though
the use of color is good once again it&#39;s
particularly the legend that is
problematic and the labels on the
ellipses now then this was a very large
table that violated the rules that I
gave you earlier but I have to say in my
own defense that in the first iteration
we didn&#39;t put this thing in the paper we
put it in the supplementary material and
you know what the reviewers never looked
at it what was going on and it turned
out as follows a collaborator had found
a couple of high haboos in southern
okinawa that appeared to be hybrids
between two species and endemic and an
invasive species on the island so we
wanted to know first of all are they
really hybrids and two what of the venom
composition what of what are they
producing so we plotted all this in a
massive table first of all we had the
transcriptomic data from the two
putative parental species in green and
blue on the two sides of the table and
then we use proteomics to plot the venom
compositions of two of the hybrids
putative hybrids down the middle and
wouldn&#39;t you know the putative hybrids
made every single venom protein in both
of the putative parental Venom&#39;s there
was no question that they were hybrids
but because we put this in the
supplementary material and the reviewers
and the editors didn&#39;t look at it they
came back and said you haven&#39;t proven
that they&#39;re hybrids you should be
counting scales and measuring snakes I
thought you idiots that doesn&#39;t prove
anything
you&#39;re asking us to to count white and
purple pea flowers when we&#39;ve given you
the gene sequences of the enzymes that
make the pigments so the next time round
when we went to another journal this
went back into the paper the use of
color did help okay it allowed you to
track what was coming from each of the
parental species in the the column in
pink were things that could have come
from either species that time the paper
was accepted and published but a word of
warning if you put color in a table
which can be used very effectively as I
just showed you many journals will say
oh that&#39;s not a table that&#39;s a figure
and you have to count it as such well go
figure
anyway so when you&#39;re creating your
figures first of all choose a plot style
that&#39;s appropriate to the data type
don&#39;t ever use XY plots for group data
use color and use it effectively create
a key that is clear legible and
comprehensible so that your readers
don&#39;t go huh and then select line types
thicknesses plot symbols and so on that
don&#39;t draw attention to themselves you
want to keep the reader&#39;s attention on
the results and the results are found in
the pattern of the data not in the
elements that make up the figure with
tables get critiques from other
experienced investigators make your
column headings clear and concise and if
you feel so motivated go ahead and use
shading and color fills to an advantage
that is to help to communicate the data
more effectively so as Peter grew said
be courageous that is try something new
be creative and communicate clearly
you
