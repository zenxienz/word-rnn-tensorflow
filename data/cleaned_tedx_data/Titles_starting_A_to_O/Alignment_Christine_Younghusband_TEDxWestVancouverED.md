math is my favorite subject to teach and
learn and what I love about teaching
mathematics and learning what
mathematics is finding patterns how many
of you remember the order of operations
or bad math what I like to put this
question is that you have to work from
the inside out to get the answer whereas
in this question from calculus to find
the derivative or slope of the tangent
line you have to work from the outside
in using the chain rule these two
examples remind me of the Russian
nesting doll where one doll is nested
inside another it&#39;s a metaphor for order
in place order in place is important in
mathematics but there&#39;s also
opportunities to play so for example to
solve this linear equation you could
subtract 5 from both sides as seen on
the left and work from the outside in or
you could divide both sides by 2 you
first and work from the inside out both
solutions are mathematically correct
this on the other hand is not this is
what I call making math happen yes there
was multiplying dividing and subtracting
and adding but the rules weren&#39;t
followed and concepts were misunderstood
hence the wrong answer or conceptual
error 7 years ago I too experienced a
conceptual error I wasn&#39;t following the
rules concepts were misunderstood and
they&#39;re left teaching what I wanted to
do was to play create try something new
so I just assumed all of these other
roles in education I teach at the
University I&#39;m elected to be a school
trustee and I&#39;m a bit of a Twitter
junkie from these edge you experiences
though I was able to look at the school
system through different lenses and what
I realized is that the school system is
structured much like the Russian Russian
nesting dolls where there&#39;s order in
place for example the large dog may
represent the Board of Education
followed by senior management school
principals teachers and support staff
and the students in the middle at the
heart of what we do in this
conceptualization the size of the doll
does not represent power or importance
but relative distance from the student
as a teacher I was the closest to
students in student learning
and it looked at the system from the
inside out as a school trustee I look I
don&#39;t have direct access to students
that be playing with the trains but I do
have influence on student learning but
in a different way and I look at the
system from the outside in and each role
has responsibilities but each role has
limitations like math multiplication
can&#39;t do what subtraction does
reciprocating is not the same as square
rooting so it&#39;s going to take all of us
in the system like all of the operations
in math to get the right answer so we
can thrive together we create a ripple
effect for our students we create a
difference in their lives and in their
learning regardless of what role we play
so imagine where to look for your
students and look for ourselves if we
were all cooperative learners critical
thinkers good communicators and dare I
say math gurus because whatever we want
for students is what we want for
ourselves so if you feel that you&#39;re
left out or you&#39;re at odds of the system
what are you going to do about it your
alignment matters what is your role in
education what kind of impact you have
on student learning what impact would
you like to have my challenge to you is
to find your place for me it used to be
math teaching mathematics done with
school trustee and maybe I&#39;m gonna write
books but what I do know for sure is is
when we are aligned we don&#39;t just make
ripples in the system together we make
waves
thank you
