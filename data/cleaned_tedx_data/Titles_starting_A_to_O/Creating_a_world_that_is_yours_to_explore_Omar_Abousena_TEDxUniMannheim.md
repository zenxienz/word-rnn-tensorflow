if there is one thing I&#39;m sure about is
that most people are far more talented
and extraordinary than they believe
themselves to be a lot of us think that
we have nothing unique to show to the
world that were too ordinary for anybody
to care about our ideas that whatever we
do there&#39;s always going to be someone
that can do it better than us
in reality we each have a personal
combination of skills passions and
talents that make us far more unique
than we give ourselves credit for the
problem is that we choose to separate
our personal qualities when in fact we
should be combining them over the past
year I&#39;ve been experimenting with the
idea of combining passion with craft
create products and can provide
something new and original to the world
I want to share this experiment with you
hoping that you can start a project of
your very own it&#39;s self fulfilling in
many ways combining what you love with
what you do best because it opens a door
to your own limitless imagination it
allows you to explore your own talents
and skills and best of all it gives you
a world which is wholly yours to explore
all you need are three things a passion
a craft and a solution let&#39;s start off
with passion when it comes to passion we
need to understand ourselves we need to
understand why we enjoy doing the things
we love we need to look back all the way
to our childhoods and see what our
interests and hobbies were throughout
the years we&#39;re looking for a pattern
with which these hobbies and interests
reflect on our true inner passion I&#39;ll
use myself as an example
over the years I loved to draw comics I
loved to write short stories and I loved
to produce my own music so what&#39;s the
pattern here drawing writing music I
look deeper into each hobby trying to
understand what was the course in
malaria what was there that spoke to me
and I realized that each of them was a
medium in which I could tell stories
through these mediums I was able to give
people a window to my own imagination I
realized that storytelling was my inner
passion so now that we have a passion
we now need a solution and here&#39;s where
things start to get creative if you want
to have our very own unique project we
need to first find a problem that is
worth solving and a place where we can
start with that is with our passions we
know a lot of our passions us ups and
downs about shortcomings and about the
various problems that might appear we
want to ask ourselves what is the
biggest problem within my passion there
can be many problems can be the case if
your passion involves a certain sport
type it can be the case that injuries
are too frequent or it could be the case
that the learning curve is too high or
it could be the case that there are
tools you need or the equipment you need
are way too expensive these are all
legitimate problems that you can try to
attempt to solve so what did I ask
myself I asked myself what is the
biggest problem when it came to creating
my own stories and I said it takes years
to come up with a good story but it
doesn&#39;t stop there want to keep on
nagging we want to keep on asking why
why sorry
why did it take me so long to write
these stories and I would say okay plot
holes and inconsistencies start popping
up after throw a lot away aloft chapters
out and you continue on asking why the
reason being is that every single time
you ask why you&#39;re revealing a new layer
to the problem that you didn&#39;t even
realize about the main point of this is
that you want to solve a problem at its
root not at its surface the idea here is
that you saw or you cure the problem not
at side-effect so what was the root
problem I revealed or found out about
storytelling it came all down to
planning out the story world at first
the plot is simple you got Marion
characters you got your two or three
villains but as you add on more chapters
or as you go on to the story things get
a bit more complicated you gotta throw
out chapters you gotta rethink the story
and it&#39;s really demotivating especially
for people who start out with writing
that they have to get rid of certain
things they spent way too much time
writing on and investing in so my
solution focuses on fixing that on
making the planning process a lot more
easier efficient all without sacrificing
quality and of course the fun of writing
so now that we have our solution we now
need a craft now what do I mean by craft
craft is any form of field or work that
you can use to apply your solution now
normally this would be your field of
study or expertise but doesn&#39;t have to
be can be something you enjoy can teach
yourself the great thing about the
internet nowadays is you can almost
learn anything there is an absolute
abundance of information guides and
tools that you
use for my very first part of project I
decided to build an app but prior to
that I&#39;ve never built an app before nor
have I programmed anything before but
within three months I was able to build
a fully functional app was it good maybe
not but it did what it was meant to do
and that&#39;s the main point here you want
to build a prototype you want to build
the most minimal thing you can have as
your solution and once you have that you
can then think about about all the
features and whether it want to be the
big next thing but you don&#39;t have to be
you just gotta have that ace thing ready
and from there you can use your
prototype to get feedback to ask people
what they think of it and this is where
you start growing your project you can
take it after that into any form of
direction you want to help illustrate
everything I&#39;ve just said I want to show
you something I&#39;ve been working on the
past two months project 1001 combining
my passion craft and solution I came up
with the project thousand and one an
assistant software that helps you create
and plan out the entire story world with
you and the way that works is software
divides the story into different layers
the characters the factions the world
the social norms of the time where the
story takes place all of these things
are taking into consideration at the
beginning and you go into more detail
with that you start dictating what kind
of characters you want and amazing thing
about the software is it allows you to
generate characters with their own
fully-fledged personalities and
backstories more than 30 variables
dictate the different backstories and
psychologies and their agendas and their
life goals behind these characters and
the thing behind this generation tool or
sort of planning tool is
when it comes to planning the chapters
or the scenes the story at the distort
the assistant software can then say hey
this would be a nice chapter suggestion
or it would be case for example if you
have a certain chapter they would like
to add they would say wait a minute
there&#39;s an inconsistency here or there
is no conflict here when there should be
for example and the amazing thing about
having a project like this even though
you haven&#39;t created a full version of it
and all of you&#39;re just showing is just a
mock-up or a prototype it&#39;s amazing to
show people what it would be like to
have it it&#39;s amazing to have your only
your very own project where you can just
go in whatever direction you want and
it&#39;s as if you find yourself in a
goldmine where every time you continue
on mining you&#39;ll always find more and
more places to mining and there&#39;s one
last thing I would like to share you
that is needed for this method and that
is to be persistent you will be
disappointed you will lose and you will
fail a lot but failure is not an end it
is a means failure is your compass when
people don&#39;t like your project or your
product you want to ask why you want to
ask him what would make you like it or
what would you like to have for you to
use it you want to continue on building
on that feedback to help build value for
your project and that&#39;s the way you do
it through failure you find the right
directions for your project and if you
do as I have told you and you realize
you will realize how talented you are
and come to understand your talents and
your skills and best of all if you&#39;re
lucky you&#39;ll be doing something you love
for the rest of your life
thank you
