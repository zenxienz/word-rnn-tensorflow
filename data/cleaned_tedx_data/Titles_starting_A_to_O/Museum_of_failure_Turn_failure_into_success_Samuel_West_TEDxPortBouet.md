um yeah I&#39;m a psychologist and
researcher of innovation I got tired of
all the success stories you know what
I&#39;m talking about
yeah the shiny happy person who&#39;s happy
successful rich blah blah blah blah blah
I got tired of it and I thought it was
time to change things so I started a
museum of failure here it is it&#39;s in
Sweden and yeah it has about 80
different products and services that are
in some way failures commercial flops or
fuck-ups in one way or another I like
that saying fuck up at a TED event so
Leo Tolstoy the famous Russian author he
wrote all happy families are alike but
every unhappy family is unhappy in its
own special way so I&#39;ve stolen that
quote cuz that&#39;s what I do and I&#39;ve
given a little twist for the museum so
the theme of the museum is that all
successful innovation it&#39;s sort of the
same story but it&#39;s in the failures that
it&#39;s the really interesting stories lie
all right failure on stage okay so let&#39;s
get started with some of the products
here okay so this is the Google glass
it&#39;s not that old 2013 Google launched
it it&#39;s really really cool it&#39;s got like
inbuilt Wi-Fi microphone a video and
this really cool screen that projects an
image way out in the front it was a
failure because Google they didn&#39;t
understand privacy issues people don&#39;t
like to be filmed without their
knowledge okay this next thing might go
lost in translation but I&#39;m going to try
anyway
people who used Google glass
they were called glass holes that&#39;s how
serious it was so strange that Google
didn&#39;t take privacy issues seriously or
they didn&#39;t quite appreciate it well
here&#39;s Coca Cola&#39;s one of their many
failures and this is that well this is
that Coca Cola I don&#39;t know how to say
this it&#39;s not black we call that black I
think so the Coca Cola decided that hey
people are buying more expensive coffee
and energy drinks let&#39;s make our own
so they took diet coke and coffee mixed
them surprised it didn&#39;t work
here&#39;s Kodak Kodak was a pioneer they
were very successful with digital
cameras but they didn&#39;t understand what
was gonna happen people stopped printing
their images people don&#39;t print their
photos anymore and Kodak&#39;s entire
business model was based on getting
people to print more images didn&#39;t
happen 2012 they went bankrupt the same
month but Instagram was sold to Facebook
for 1 billion US dollars it&#39;s kind of
crazy when you think about it so Kodak
had all the technology but they didn&#39;t
adopt their business model this is a
little ode to the French share we have
to have some French fuck ups so this is
big big world one of the world&#39;s biggest
manufacturer of pens they decided in
2011 ok this is not 1811 this is 2011
they decided to design a pen
specifically for women because women are
incompetent and they can&#39;t use regular
pens
sorry sorry gals so big pen for her is
twice the price because women make twice
as much money as men and of course it
comes in colors that women probably like
cuz then they&#39;re probably right with it
crazy there&#39;s a lot of comedians who&#39;ve
made a lot of fun of big for her
here&#39;s one from Sweden where the museum
is located how many people know about
IKEA yeah okay it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the it&#39;s
probably the biggest furniture
manufacturer out of Sweden in the 1980s
and 90s they experimented with
inflatable furniture it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s
easy to transport and it has some very
good advantages like it&#39;s being it&#39;s
very light okay so it&#39;s one thing they
didn&#39;t think about I imagine this you
have two of these couches in your living
room and you have two windows open at
the same time your furnitures like
moving around it&#39;s good this is one of
my favorite so 1996 a big proctor and
gamble of big american sort of consumer
products company had found the holy
grail of foods like it&#39;s a calorie free
fat substitute so you can eat all the
potato chips you want and you won&#39;t get
fat perfect this one one small problem
diarrhea
[Laughter]
so why do I expose why do I have all
these failures these were some of the
failures at the Museum the point of
having the museum is that we can learn
from these failures and I want to start
a discussion I want us to start to admit
our failures as companies as individuals
so that we can learn from it and if tell
your hurts when you fail as an
individual or if your team fails or if
your company fails it hurts it&#39;s
embarrassing
in some cultures in many Asian cultures
failing and the embarrassment associated
is so painful that you do anything to
avoid failure this summer we had some
visitors from Africa to the museum they
even had on these cool African colorful
clothes and they told me in their region
that we need a museum of failure in our
region in Africa like why what&#39;s going
on well in their region if you fail it&#39;s
not only your embarrassment it&#39;s your
children and your children you&#39;re it&#39;s
passed on in generations so they said we
need a museum of failure to help people
understand that to make progress any
kind of innovation the social innovation
technological innovation we need failure
we need to accept failures we can&#39;t have
that those cultures where it&#39;s passed on
to future generations
so my ambition with museum of failure is
to show that we need to accept failure
if we want progress and we need to be
better noble as individuals and as team
as as organizations governments schools
we really need to give failure failure
some better attention we need to give
failure the attention it deserves
and start learning from failure
