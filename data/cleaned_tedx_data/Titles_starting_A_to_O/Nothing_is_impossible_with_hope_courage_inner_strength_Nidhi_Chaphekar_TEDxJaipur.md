on the fateful day of March 22nd 2016 I
was assigned to operate a flight from
Brussels to Newark I never imagined I
would leave whom promising my kids that
I would be back after five days but
could not return home for months due to
the disaster which took place at
Brussels taking more than 32 lights and
over 300 of us were injured it shook the
world and it shook my world too
it was the most horrendous day of my
life which changed my life and
perception my survival from the bomb
blast was just the beginning of the test
of my courage resilience and hope
something that I strongly needed to
discover within myself but unfortunately
I was too fly as a senior cabin remember
the moment I stepped in the departure
hall I saw the first human suicide bomb
attack but couldn&#39;t immediately figure
out what it was by the time I sensed
something was wrong and wanted to move
away there was another big bang mmm and
that was the second blast the impact of
the blast was such that I was thrown
away to the other end the blaze heat
noise of the explosion was so powerful
as of the Sun lightning and ponder hit
onto us all together I fell unconscious
but my subconscious mind was alerting me
get up wake up I regain consciousness I
opened my eyes it was hard to see
anything because of the smoke at first I
couldn&#39;t feel my legs
with fear when I looked at them they
were intact but the badly injured the
chunks of flesh scooped and pierced with
metal pieces I tried to escape but I
could not move I even tried to drag
myself out but the pieces for piercing
in my body mass of needles then I took
the help of a policeman and sat on the
chair where a photographer captured that
photo of mine while I was feeling dazed
I was asking God how could the human
being be so brutal
I was not only shocked but was feeling
dreadful what I saw I cannot describe in
words because I feel there are no words
to express or to describe the trauma of
such an inhuman and unpleasant act of
terrorism even in that situation where
people were crying of pain people
[Music]
screaming to find their loved ones
people whining passing by with injuries
of a lying on the ground for medical aid
to arrive I was reassuring them i
pacified many by giving confidence to
them but we all are safe we are fine in
spite of so many injuries I had suffered
at the same time I was trying to find
out ways to stop the bleeding especially
from my left leg because I knew this
could be the reason of my death it took
me nearly three hours to reach the
hospital and in those three hours I kept
myself calm and more importantly kept my
conscious I self conscious the moment I
reached the hospital doctors team rushed
towards me with volley of medical
questions after answering all the
questions I asked I will amputate my leg
the doctors had no answer then I asked
is my face totally burned the nurse
replied upon
yes on hearing this I told the nurse I
don&#39;t want to live anymore then I know
it feels very shocking but at that
moment I had no idea what shape or form
I would be in even if I survived without
even wasting a minute
they started their line of treatment
they performed many surgeries they
removed 47 metal pieces from my body
I suffered 25% of severe burns and was
kept on a ventilator at night doctors
decided to shift me to one of the
Europe&#39;s best born Center hospital
because my bones started deteriorating
in the morning I was airlifted I was
taken to the ground shallow a hospital
where doctors carried out more surgeries
the carried out skin grafting procedures
on my deep wounds and burns but during
the course of my treatment my health
started dropping day by day it started
becoming worsen the oxygen requirement
given to me earlier by a ventilator was
just normal
22% at at reached hundred percent my
infection level crossed all parameters
and was dangerously high my lungs got
infected water started accumulating in
my lungs my parameters were fluctuating
my body temperature was not coming down
from 41 degrees Celsius which is almost
one zero six degrees Fahrenheit and
finally my heart started pumping poorly
doctors were surprised as to why no
medicine was effective on me doctors
advised my family members to keep on
speaking to me through the speakerphone
which was outside my ICU room they
instructed them to keep on motivating me
because they said she could hear her
tell her that she&#39;s doing a great job
she&#39;s fine
nothing is wrong with her tell her to
keep on fighting because ask for the
doctors I was fighting against all odds
because I desire to survive
my condition was not improving doctors
suspected something&#39;s wrong we plan to
do another city scan but this time that
it a 3d CT scan in which they found that
there are still many metal pieces yet
left within me the start of the removal
process and the biggest one what they
found was about 2 inches long in my
right foot bone there are still many
more left within me but they cannot be
removed as they&#39;ve gone deep inside like
one in my left eye orbit but after that
day things started to improve
and finally after 23 days of being in
the state of induced coma I opened my
eyes I fail to notice anyone few days
later than that I got a part of my
memory back I recognize my husband my
sister and my brother-in-law I expressed
my desire to meet my kids to see them
doctors told me I will not be able to go
back for at least a month and a half
because I&#39;m very feeble there are more
surgeries to take place I decided I
would go back as early as possible and
for that I started rebuilding my
confidence back
I started motivating myself I knew it&#39;s
not going to be that easy
and the next itself I broke down I broke
down when I saw my face in the mirror
for the first time after the blast
I couldn&#39;t recognize myself my one eye
became smaller than other one my face
had clearer burn marks with patches and
scars all over instead of long beautiful
hair
I looked bald I got scared looking
itself and never wanted to take the
second breath because of the negative
thoughts entering my mind flooding my
mind what will I do how would I face the
world what would people think of me I
thought I lost the battle without even
fighting but my family is very
supportive
they explained me the meaning and value
of life
the elucidated me that beauty is not
what you see in the mirror beauty is
what you feel about yourself they
encouraged me they encouraged me to
choose strength over weakness to adopt
forgiveness over revenge and to embrace
courage of a fear as the whole world was
playing for me they asked me to recover
as early as possible and set out on a
journey of inspiration and help people
fight when all their hope is lost I also
thought if God has gifted that life
backed me it has to have a reason and I
would make it count I believed and now
wanted to spread the power of positive
thinking
constructive belief in hard work which
can turn the universe to your side
entirely wheelchair-bound had multiple
fractures got crushed bones with hands
and foot crafted but many wounds and
deep were burns with yet one heal bone
being hollow with many metal pieces yet
within me but I started a new life my
desire to survive had grown into desire
to live it took a lot of confidence
hardwork positive thinking in all my
disgrace to fly me back to end up with
him just 20 days time it was a very
emotional moment when I met my kids and
my family I was with them just for a few
minutes and from there I was taken
directly to the hospital my balloons
were very deep so doctors decided to do
rest of the surgeries after a few months
they gave me discharge from the hospital
after three days advised my family
members to keep a full-time nurse for me
because they said she&#39;s dependent and
wounds required dressing and cleaning
every day their father said we cannot
afford any more complications
I was determined to do everything by
myself so I refused to keep a nurse
doctors were hesitant predominantly
because in my case the chances of
getting infection was on a very high
scale and if it would occur it would end
to my bones and that would be a disaster
but my confidence on the faith of the
doctors for over three months I was
dressing my my my wounds by myself
without getting any complications raised
forget about walking
[Applause]
forget about walking I was not even
allowed to hang my legs down while
sitting on the bed or on the wheelchair
but I had read somewhere it&#39;s 20% of
medicines and 80% of a person&#39;s positive
willpower which gives you hundred
percent positive results I requested and
I took permission from the doctors to
allow me walking with the help of a
walker
doctors were terrified on my plans
they said you write like may collapse
totally and will not be able to take the
weight but I was adamant and was
prepared for any consequences my desire
to live had grown into a desire to
conquer at first I could just sit and
stand with the support of a walker after
few days I could just take a single step
and would cry of unbearable pain but I
didn&#39;t leave hope I kept on trying
because it&#39;s very rightly said there is
no gain without pain and within a few
months I overcame walker and could walk
like any other human being doctors were
in are amazed of my strength and
willpower and even though we have almost
got my life back it has made me wonder a
few things it&#39;s not just me who&#39;s been
blessed with these superpowers every
single soul on this earth has been
blessed with these powers of courage and
strength we need to just find and ignite
them we need to hold on to them today
and now
difficulties come in our lives not to
destroy us but to help us find and
realize the hidden potential and powers
you have let our difficulties know that
v2 are difficult remember an arrow can
only be shot and it&#39;s pulled behind so
when life is dragging us behind but
difficulties that means it&#39;s checking on
to a well parents friend and it&#39;s gone
to launch into something great they got
and even and I kept wondering about
courage I slowly realized why we all
needed more than ever today because we
don&#39;t live in the same world for used to
i wish nobody should ever go through
what I went through but that doesn&#39;t
change the reality of the unfortunate
world we live in we live in a free trial
world a world where such willful
disasters are still taking place an eye
for an eye cannot be a solution to any
problem the answer to this challenge
does not lie with our politicians our
media cannot be solved with weapons nor
can be fought with hostility we cannot
fight terrorism with equal aggression
but humanity beats terrorism and that is
the reason why this world has survived
and will continue to survive and
flourish humanity is the courage to
accept each other the baby our humanity
is the spirit to appreciate the
differences be our bond with and to
respect the differences behalf our
survival depends upon each other
survival the only solution for this
problem is worship humanity can&#39;t the
seeds of love and compassion water them
with faith and relationship and reap the
beautiful fruits of peace and prosperity
love compassion peace faith
relationships they are not the luxuries
of a life but the other necessary
and without them your humanity cannot
survive thank you
[Applause]
