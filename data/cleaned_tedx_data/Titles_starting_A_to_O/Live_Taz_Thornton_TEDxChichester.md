thanks for that you know a few days ago
before coming here I was talking to my
peers and I was saying this is an
important talk chatter your slides
shouldn&#39;t use images and that responds
with tasks you&#39;re a natural storyteller
you need to paint the pictures with your
words with your emotions with your
presence so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do
for you today I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m going to
take you on a story that will take you
back in time to some of my story and
then maybe into the future to some of
your stories I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m going
to leave you in the presence the
presence even feeling a little bit more
determination a little bit more
inspiration and just knowing that you&#39;re
going to do something awesome with your
life so every good story begins with the
slow build isn&#39;t it so I&#39;m going to
start with something really mundane are
you ready for this
brace yourselves and when I talk to you
about ceiling tiles you must post enough
for that bit but maybe they won&#39;t though
supposed to be funny later on so that&#39;s
okay I want to talk to you specifically
about corcyraeans ceiling tiles you know
if you stay power steering ceiling tiles
you can see all kinds of amazing images
of pictures and displays in them nine
hours is about the right map time to do
that
you can see all kinds of pictures and
posturing ceiling tiles after nine hours
how do I know that I know that because
nine hours is precisely the amount of
time I lay on a flatbed with my head
in some bags staring at ceiling tiles in
a league with no real choice to do
anything other than find those pictures
because anything else would have been
thinking about why was there and I
absolutely didn&#39;t want to think about
why I was there you see that morning as
have become the norm I&#39;d made a pact
I&#39;d have my usual conversation with
whatever god or gods were out there
I prayed at us and for whatever reason
they have not given me the painless
terminal illness I&#39;ve been praying from
so it made the same pact the same pact
that we&#39;ve been making every day for
months now that would go out and I would
take as many risks and they could
possibly take and if at the end of that
day I was still alive somebody wanted me
to be here so I got in my car I was
driving to work and asked I approached
the brow of the hill on the wrong side
of the road music blaring I hit amount
of bliss as I saw the other car
approaching this is it thank you
I&#39;m getting in but that moment faded
very quickly quickly when I realized
that it didn&#39;t matter how much I didn&#39;t
want to be alive it didn&#39;t matter how
much I was terrified of going home that
night I couldn&#39;t take anybody else down
because of my
death wish perfect through the out quite
quickly everything really does slow down
I&#39;m thankful to the tree the broke my
flight at the bottom of rubber six
footage fast forward to the hospital but
the second you hear people say something
along the lines of spinal damage
everything changes everything changed
for me in that moment you see I haven&#39;t
told anybody about the abuse or going
through our home I haven&#39;t told anybody
about the extent of the domestic abuse I
was going through I haven&#39;t told anybody
about the depression I was going through
I haven&#39;t told anybody how much of
myself I was losing how much of myself
had already lost I haven&#39;t told anyone
how desperately I wanted to do anything
to avoid walking back through that door
every night but in that moment when you
see men in white coats and you hear them
having lain there for nine hours and
pretty much suspension you hear words
spinal damage and believe me the first
words that go through your mind I&#39;m
going to be paralyzed you idiot Tazz
you&#39;ve tried to escape you&#39;ve tried
everything to get out and now look at
you you&#39;ve now written in car off so
you&#39;ve got no you cop in a way to get
out and if you&#39;re paralyzed then won&#39;t
you even more traps than ever so that
was one of those choice moments and in
that moment the hopelessness I had been
feeling up to that point suddenly turned
into her tonight
I thought I could sink even further or I
could do something ever had one of those
moments we said hold on this stuff might
happen to me for a reason
maybe what if a lot of the stuff I&#39;ve
been going through is so that I can help
other people with it what if I can
change other people&#39;s lives what if I
can talk to people who have a brain area
of abuse that I was in but if I can help
people show that there&#39;s a way out tell
people believe that and that&#39;s when I
changed but the story doesn&#39;t end there
let me fast forward about eight or nine
years ahead I&#39;d escaped from that
relationship I pretty much press the
reset button on life you know we don&#39;t
really get the chance to do that there&#39;s
no obvious big button we can just press
and go back to the beginning but somehow
I have managed to reset everything yeah
and another couple of suicidal blips but
I&#39;ve got past them I had a new job I&#39;d
moved to a different part of the country
I was now and I&#39;m waiting for a gasp on
this point just so you know even if
you&#39;re watching at home I want to dust
for this bed I was now UK director for
what at the time was one of the world&#39;s
biggest multinational publishing
companies
thank you very much I have a wonderful
new partner I have the posh car I have
the bonus checks I have the holidays but
still wasn&#39;t happy
why wasn&#39;t I happy on paper everything
was just amazing but I realized that I
still wasn&#39;t filled up I realized that
something had to give
I was starting out on this program of
learning all these different amazing
life enhancing personal development
techniques in my spare time spare time
for anyone who&#39;s been at that level in
corporate so I trained in NLP er
training coaching they&#39;re trained in
mentoring they&#39;re trained in all those
corporate conflict management things I
even trained in some of the more woowoo
aspects of life I spent about 10 years
learning from shamans and medicine
people and I got it and I&#39;ve realized
that what really film it was helping
other people
remember that try something back in the
day but still wasn&#39;t doing it
it took a series of really really tough
life challenges to get to the point
where I did something about it yet again
I ignored all the little bits of gravel
and all the stones and I waited for the
boulders to hit it took me hitting a
breakdown to do something about it that
breakdown turned into my breakthrough
absolutely then it was the best thing
that could have happened because it were
ugly open so far that all the stuff had
been holding on to just slow down and I
was able to rebuild myself in the shape
man man there&#39;s that reset button again
but so many of us do this every day we
trend along through life being unhappy
and doing nothing about it so this is
what I want to talk about stories I want
to talk about yours
you know and I also want to just talk
about the personal development movement
now you know there&#39;s a bit of a backlash
going on at the moment I say all the
time we sit from some of my place this
is big backlash engaged people who are
successful I thought if it&#39;s just in the
UK but we love to bring people down when
they&#39;ve made it don&#39;t we
and I want to bump up trend a little bit
I want to buck that trend particularly
when it comes to people who&#39;ve made a
career in helping other people if I had
50 PV for everyone who&#39;s ditched
somebody so you take massive action
I prefer which that I am now so no but
that trend right now I&#39;m gonna tell you
that you do need to take massive action
but there&#39;s a caveat and this is what
they don&#39;t tell you massive action is
going to be different for every one of
you here so go back to some of my story
for a moment that massive action whether
it was the universe intervening or
whether ID was just driving like an
idiot think the latter the massive
action was thinking that I might be
paralyzed it took something that big to
make me to maybe make that change
the next piece of massive action was
that breakdown that turned into my
breakthrough but I want to tell you that
if any of you here are unhappy if any of
you here I&#39;m not doing that thing that
you&#39;re meant to be doing you&#39;ve all have
that thing raise your hands if you have
that weird thing when you know
something&#39;s going really right to
consider like your eyes are glowing from
the inside now who&#39;s not that feeling
yeah we all have your massive action
doesn&#39;t have to be as big as breaking a
bug it doesn&#39;t have to be having a
breakdown my massive action was getting
out my massive action was getting out of
the abusive relationship my massive
action was getting out of the career
that didn&#39;t fit my massive action was
taking that massive leap of faith and
going into a career I have no previous
experience of I just had this gut
feeling and a desire and a drive to do
something to help other people my
massive action was writing some of my
experiences down in my books in black
and white let me tell you that&#39;s
terrifying because it&#39;s one thing
talking to an audience where I can gauge
your reactions and it&#39;s another thing
putting your story out there and having
no idea how that&#39;s going to be received
my massive action is telling my story to
you now in the hope that it might give
you some inspiration to change your life
- one of the ladies who comes on to some
of my empowerment events she had been
locked in a room for years kept drugs
and horrendously abused by the time she
got out of that relationship she was
severely I will phobic because of the
drugs she&#39;ll enforce but she was
addicted to substances and therefore
lost her kids massive action for her was
getting her care system to drop her
right at the door of the empowerment
event I was running with our local
domestic abuse support team and coming
in Agra phobic lady walked into that
room her massive action was by lunchtime
of that day walking into town to get a
sandwich
her massive action was getting clean her
massive action was being able to take
her son to see spider-man her massive
action was going dress shopping with
dr. her massive action was getting her
kids back to the actress of coached her
massive action was finding the courage
suspecting her agent you&#39;re not getting
with the roles I need I need to find
someone else to the therapist I&#39;ve been
coaching the massive action for her was
completely changing her brand and being
more aligned to who she was and
attracting the clients that she wanted
to work with rather than wearing the
suit and the twins that the girls are
being she thought she had to be so
what&#39;s your massive action going to be
and I want you to just be aware you
should never ever wait for defining
moments in your life because you have no
idea that a moment is a defining moment
until after it has happened and when
those moments happen when you know that
thing that just happened that&#39;s a
pivotal moment leave your humility for
later in that moment you&#39;d be proud you
reach high and you have your back and
you give yourself a pat because in that
moment you know that whatever it was how
large have small whatever it is to you
you survived it you did it and you&#39;re
going to make change from it so you&#39;ll
be proud and you absolutely grab that
moment if I go back to before I escaped
from corporate I knew I have potential I
was tired of having potential I wanted
mine now at the end of my life I don&#39;t
want my headstone to say had potential I
thought well my victory to say she had
potential the first story people hear
about when you no longer on this earth
don&#39;t have potential when is your now
going to be I chose to tell my potential
into mine now I chose to use the
difficult times and turn them into gold
to help other people I chose to leap so
don&#39;t wait for the defining moments and
don&#39;t be waiting for that epiphany what
is it what if this is it what if this is
your epiphany let it be now let this be
your Epiphany
whatever your story&#39;s going to be make
it a good
