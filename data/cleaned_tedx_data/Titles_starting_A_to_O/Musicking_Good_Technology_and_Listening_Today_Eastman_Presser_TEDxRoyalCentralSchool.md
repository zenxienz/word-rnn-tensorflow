[Music]
my name is Eastman and my bachelor&#39;s
degree would tell you that I&#39;m a
composer and my website would tell you
that I&#39;m a sound artist and occasionally
I&#39;m able to convince people that I&#39;m an
academic but I would tell you that I&#39;m a
music er and that&#39;s not a grammatical
error that&#39;s a term that I&#39;m borrowing
from a man named Christopher small who
wrote a lovely little book called music
ink you&#39;ll see here an image of myself
and my dog and I happen to be holding
the book a lot of Christopher smalls
theories that are presented in this book
are grounded in the idea that music is a
verb and not a noun
I&#39;m not a stickler for grammar but I do
believe that music is a verb and not a
noun or at the very least I believe that
it&#39;s advantageous for us to think of it
that way so during this talk I will do
so I&#39;ll now read you Christopher smalls
definition of music inge to clear up
some of these ideas so to music is quote
to take part in any capacity in a
musical performance whether by
performing by listening by rehearsing or
practicing by providing material for
performance or by dancing small goes on
to write we might at times even extend
this definition to the hefty men who
move the piano and the drums before the
gig the cleaners who clean up after the
gig and those who take the tickets he
goes on to describe a bunch of different
roles the effect of applying this theory
to music is a kind of leveling of the
playing field of the different things
you could do when you are music so
listening or taking tickets or cleaning
is just as much music as performing or
composing so that&#39;s kind of the ideas
that are grounding me in this talk I&#39;m
gonna start now by giving you a
criminally brief history of listening
technology as is the case with the rest
of my talk this history is gonna focus
on the english-speaking Western world
because that&#39;s the world that I know in
the world that I&#39;ve researched they&#39;re
very rich histories of listening
elsewhere in the world but I&#39;m not the
one who should be talking about them so
from the dawn of time until about the
mid 1800s music was something that you
had to hear or see live you had to be in
the right place at the
time in order to experience it then in
the mid-1800s with the emergence of the
middle class and a widening of music
tuition and education and availability
of things like piano reductions when an
orchestral piece would be reduced to a
piano score and the availability of
musical instruments for those who had it
within their means to purchase them
music was no longer just a thing that
you had to be in the right place at the
right time in order to experience it was
something that you either had to be in
the right place at the right time in
order to experience or you had to own
the right things and know people who
knew what to do with them or know what
to do with them yourself then in the
early 1900&#39;s you could finally buy
recordings of music right with the dawn
of recording technology so this meant
that you no longer had to be in the
right place at the right time
you just had to own the right thing and
be in the right place right then in the
1980s with the invention of the Walkman
and later the disc man you could finally
take some of your music in the form of
cassettes or CDs with you anywhere you
wanted so you no longer had to be in the
right place you could be anywhere you
wanted then in the late night late 1990s
and the early 2000s with the invention
of the mp3 player you could effectively
take all of your music anywhere you
wanted right then today with smartphones
and streaming technologies you can
effectively take all of anybody&#39;s music
wherever you want so the effect is that
are listening to music has become
Unchained and untethered and we&#39;re no
longer tied to places we&#39;re no longer
tied to people to experience music we&#39;re
no longer even tied to certain
possessions or purchases right so the
next thing that I&#39;m going to do is give
a brief summary of some ideas and my
interpretation of those ideas and I&#39;m
getting these ideas from Jacques Derrida
I can feel that we all just tensed up a
little bit when I mentioned that name
and that&#39;s for a good reason
we heard Jess earlier talk about kind of
the aggressiveness or the alienation
that happens when we use academic
language but I&#39;m gonna try to keep this
as brief as possible I&#39;m getting these
ideas from a work called signature event
context written by Derrida that was
first published in the book limited Inc
as you can see I had to return this book
to the library before I took these
pictures so we&#39;re left with just a
sure of myself and my dog and so for the
sake of clarity and time the example
that I&#39;m going to explain to some of
these points it&#39;s gonna focus around a
wedding ceremony okay
so let&#39;s for the sake of argument just
imagine that we&#39;re all practicing
Christians who believe in the sanctity
of marriage and its relationship to the
church bear with me this is this is
gonna be relevant I know I know it&#39;s an
unfortunate example so so we&#39;re all
we&#39;re all practicing Christians who
believe in the sanctity of marriage and
its relationship to the church and I am
a priest okay and I am tasked with
marrying the two of you if I can be so
bold okay so let&#39;s say that it&#39;s okay I
can see you&#39;re enjoying it a little bit
that&#39;s good so let&#39;s say that it&#39;s two
days before the big wedding right and
the three of us are seated in a pub and
I&#39;m explaining how the ceremony&#39;s gonna
go and I say yet that I thought I yet
that I did this this and this I do I do
I now pronounce you man and wife
so that doesn&#39;t marry you so Derrida
argues the words themselves don&#39;t
actually mean anything I said I now
pronounce you man and wife
but that didn&#39;t make you married let&#39;s
say it&#39;s the next day and it&#39;s the day
before the big day and we&#39;re in the
church with everybody here and everybody
who&#39;s gonna see the wedding is gathered
and we&#39;re standing up there at the altar
I&#39;m wearing whatever it is a priest
wears and I say to the two of you this
is how the ceremony&#39;s gonna go yesterday
yo da da da I do I do I now pronounce
you man and wife so that didn&#39;t even
marry him so Derrida argues it&#39;s not the
text the words themselves don&#39;t mean
anything and it&#39;s not the context it&#39;s
not the place where these things happen
now on the big day where we&#39;ve all
agreed that you&#39;re gonna get married and
we&#39;re standing up there at the altar and
I say yeah I thought that I thought that
I have a pretty creative you know
approach to wedding ceremony and so I do
I do I now pronounce you man and wife
that does marry you
so Derrida argues it is the event that
is the custodian of meaning that creates
meaning it&#39;s not the words themselves
it&#39;s not where we hear the words or
where we say the words it&#39;s the event
that takes place that is the custodian
of meaning
I think that was relatively painless
maybe luckily I&#39;m not the only person
that attempts to apply these ideas to
music Tia Donora
is a great musicologist who wrote this
book music in everyday life that talks
about applying this kind of semiotic a
big big word but that&#39;s that&#39;s what we
just talked about just that idea to
music right and so I&#39;m gonna use for
another example I&#39;m going to use the
American National Anthem
another subpar example but it&#39;ll it&#39;ll
function for what we&#39;re doing so I&#39;m
sure that we&#39;re all familiar with the
national anthem of America the
star-spangled banner the beginning goes
a little something like this
yeah right something like that great so
um it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a great performance so
Tia Donora argues that there is nothing
inherently patriotic there&#39;s nothing
inherently American there&#39;s nothing
inherently nationalistic about those
notes in that order right it is only
through repeated listening to that piece
of music that we make meaning out of it
so a lot of Americans might tell you oh
the national anthem is a great very
American song it&#39;s a very nationalistic
song it&#39;s a very patriotic song but
that&#39;s really only because they&#39;ve
listened to it so many times while
looking at a flag hand held over their
heart the other hand holding a hotdog
getting ready to enjoy a baseball game I
myself tend to think of bowling when I
hear the national anthem because I&#39;ve
been at many more bowling events than
baseball events I also think of Jimi
Hendrix&#39;s 1969 performance of the
national anthem at Woodstock I think of
Whitney Houston&#39;s recording of the
national anthem lately I&#39;ve been walking
around London that the other day I
walked past Westminster and I was
listening to Duke Ellington&#39;s
performance of the star-spangled banner&#39;
live at the Newport 1953 and the idea
that I&#39;m trying to talk about today is
that that&#39;s a fairly new development me
being able to walk around a city where I
am NOT a citizen not owning the record
but listening to it on a whim and
creating these kind of new associations
and new meanings as I listen to these
pieces of music in events
as we&#39;ve described earlier right and
it&#39;s great because it feels as though
our technology has finally caught up
with our ideas about music so as I said
before we&#39;re finally able to listen
anywhere at any time really to anything
for the most part and we have these
ideas that are about making meaning in
events and things not having a meaning
in themselves the words themselves don&#39;t
mean anything the context doesn&#39;t mean
anything it&#39;s the event where meaning is
created and we can now have listening
events anywhere at any time the problem
is that this is not how people talk
about music today for the most part if
we look at music critics if we look at
music education today if we look at even
performance of music that&#39;s not the way
that people talk about music and I&#39;d
like to describe the way that they do
talk about music and what I think some
problems with that are and so I&#39;m going
to use the example of Theodor Adorno and
the composer Arnold Schoenberg Theodor
Adorno was a German philosopher who
notably hated jazz and also thought that
see realist composition what I think is
the most boring form of music was God&#39;s
gift to society and Arnold Schoenberg
was a serious composer and he may still
be for all I know
and so Theodor Adorno wrote at great
length about Arnold Schoenberg he wrote
these incredible things about how the
way that Arnold Schoenberg organized
twelve-tone rose mimicked and critiqued
the way that society itself was
organized at the time I think I didn&#39;t
read it he might have said that I don&#39;t
know but but he said all these great
things about Arnold Schoenberg&#39;s music
but the problem with how he talked about
and wrote about Arnold Schoenberg&#39;s
music was that he wrote about it in such
a way that you could understand
everything you need to know about
Schoenberg&#39;s music just by looking at a
score right and that you could read
Arnold Schoenberg&#39;s music and understand
everything about how he was organizing
it and so listening was never actually a
part of how Theodor Adorno talked about
Arnold Schoenberg and in a large part
that is the way that people talk about
music as if listening is the thing that
occurs later a thing that occurs after
the fact once the music already has
meaning and its meaning has already been
created as opposed to the way that Tia
Donora and some others write about music
we&#39;re listening
an event that takes place and creates
its own meaning and that is how we make
meaning as listeners and as music errs
so as Tia Donora writes music analysis
that tells us about the music itself is
insufficient as a means for
understanding musical effect for
describing music semiotic force in
social life you&#39;ll notice that we have
here a picture of myself and my dog and
I&#39;m holding I happen to be holding a
copy of TIA to Nora&#39;s book music and
everyday life and I&#39;d like to make a
quick point about the images that you&#39;ve
seen so far we saw an image of myself
and my dog and I happen to be holding a
copy of Christopher smalls book music
then I talked about Derrida but I didn&#39;t
have the book so you just saw an image
of myself and my dog and then now as I
said you see myself shirtless and my dog
and I happen to be holding a copy of the
book when I was taking the two first
images that you saw I noticed that I was
wearing a t-shirt that had a registered
logo on it and I got a little bit
nervous about including those images in
there because I you know I thought it
might be like a logo on Frenchmen or
copyright infringement or something so
to take the rest of the images for my
presentation I took my shirt off when I
was taking the rest of the pictures and
that brings me actually to my final
point today which is the copyright law
can be very difficult to understand so
we have here right so it&#39;s a nice
picture we have here if I do say so
myself
we have here an image of my apartment
window I happen to be in the frame
shirtless with my dog and I happen to be
pointing in an image of the composer
Arnold Schoenberg on my computer so
you&#39;ll note that I&#39;ve been talking to
you for about 13 minutes now I&#39;ve given
you a history of two and a half
centuries of music technology I&#39;ve
discussed three different recordings
I&#39;ve talked at great length about one
specific composer and I haven&#39;t yet
played you any audio files and I won&#39;t
and and the reason for this is that I
live in fear of copyright infringement
in the way that some people live in fear
of heights or spiders copyright law is
still it&#39;s quite a difficult thing to
understand and there&#39;s this thing called
fair use that is kind of ill-defined and
still argued back and
worth in courts today and the reason
that copyright law is difficult for me
to understand is that it&#39;s something
that treats music like a noun it doesn&#39;t
treat music like a verb I would have
loved to have played you the recording
of you know Duke Ellington&#39;s
arrangements of the star-spangled
banner&#39; live at newport 1953 I would
have loved to play you some Schoenberg
no I never might I wouldn&#39;t have but I
would have loved to try and enact some
of these things that I&#39;m talking to you
about about this creating different
meanings and music through listening but
the second that I did that as far as
people who are responsible for copyright
lark are concerned I would have used an
object right I would have brought an
object into this space and used it as
opposed to what I believed I would be
doing which is enacting a verb and
getting us all to do something together
so it&#39;s unfortunate but I do think that
while our technology has caught up with
our ideas and we can now listen to music
anywhere at anytime and can finally
create these rich different meanings
about music recordings I don&#39;t think
that our laws have caught up there which
is unfortunate and I&#39;m now going to end
my talk as any good law-abiding speaker
should by making sure that I cite my
sources because we know that that&#39;s
always important and just as a bonus you
get another image of my dog thank you
for listening
[Applause]
