it&#39;s a modern D help me write if you
listen and take evasive action action
that&#39;s deliberate action that&#39;s
intentional you can shape your future
for the better
it&#39;s your choice these next few moments
this talk may very well change your life
it&#39;s your choice I wish I had listened
to you and not just listen to you but
had acted out of the subconscious
whisper that I had when I was ten eleven
nineteen twenty and twenty-one very
significant ages and moments in my life
but I&#39;m less than at this age in my
mid-20s are now do listen to the inner
voice that channels its way through this
vessel that I won&#39;t have to realize what
I know now only when I&#39;m eight years old
because about one mean this missile
plans on living a whole life we&#39;re all
time but ask yourselves how many of us
are actually truly living no matter how
challenging your specific destiny is or
world meeting this country and this
world could actually do
right now the future isn&#39;t going to
shape itself in fact the future is
waiting to be shaped by yourselves today
someone like yourself who made a
critical choice to take a chance on
change and sometimes that changes
unwarranted sometimes it&#39;s unexpected
sometimes it&#39;s change that you don&#39;t
necessarily welcome unexpected changes
happen to all of us and were not
necessarily designed to naturally
embrace change if were honest right we
often tell ourselves to defend limit and
protect ourselves from and resists
change it&#39;s our natural instinct to do
so because we want security stability
and control in our very designer makeup
as human beings we don&#39;t immediately
embrace anything that&#39;s difficult scary
uncertain and uncomfortable and in our
minds at least unnecessarily disrupts
yet with unexpected changes comes
chances and choices the darkness isn&#39;t
always a punishment sometimes it&#39;s an
opportunity at the age of 10 my father
passed away one minute he was there the
next he was gone and let me tell you
this if you haven&#39;t yet been through it
yourselves no one can prepare you for
the loss of a loved one particularly at
a young age and people often treated
like a moment but it isn&#39;t a moment it&#39;s
a journey that you have to walk every
single day and death remains a
unexpected change if it&#39;s not us it&#39;s
someone that we know and love between
the ages of 11 and 20 hours with my
single mother what a wonderful so if
surrounded by financial instability
unemployment substance abuse domestic
violence sexism and mental health
conditions you name it
that is the story that my mother my
siblings and I lived at that particular
time and dream that age it&#39;s what
Krypton in and out of my life in
episodes throughout my animations once
again change after the death of my
father had knocked on my door stable
when not hearing about incidents from a
distance I would personally witness or
become victim to some of the most
violent acts
my mother was once thrown out of a car
bloodied disorientated and injured she
still found the courage to walk herself
her it&#39;s a choice that she took in the
five seconds after having been thrown
out of the car the tension between the
truth of what was happening in my life
throughout my adolescence and the art of
mastering false pretense in the public
and in society is what kept me
preoccupied
zion.t a society in denial does the
stream particular unequal society it
waives the privileged person and
privilege comes in many different forms
there&#39;s no single form of resolution
masters the art of pretending not to
have too much and the disadvantaged
person masters the art of pretending to
have just enough when it&#39;s baby enough
and they have to be strong about it as
well we literally master the art of
false pretense and it&#39;s a conscious
choice that we take like a society in
denial waiting for change as an
individual
absolutely checked out I made a
conscious choice to avoid taking a
chance on unwarranted change could not
understand that what was happening in my
life was not just a punishment as I knew
it and understood it at the time but in
fact was an opportunity an opportunity
to be to do and to have better for
myself and for others you see you can
use your life experiences and your pain
as an instrument for your greatest
growth you can make a choice to embrace
the darkness to embrace unwarranted to
change actually realize the small
outside of the deaths in violence I
experienced in 2009 I was 19 I was in a
terrible mood - bike accident and a
speeding double cab but he hit me on the
right rear side and I flew literally
flew a few meters and landed on hot top
and strangely enough my homeland was not
scratched there was a simple stretch of
moment but my head was cut and the white
stitches I think it was about 13
stitches and for moment I could not feel
safe in my lips and if you&#39;ve ever been
through that if you ever question the
loss of feeling in your limb before oh I
want to bump you don&#39;t want to go
through that because in those seconds
you have a choice you have a choice to
say okay irrespective of what&#39;s
happening right now I can conquer and
fight or I can just give in and say look
I&#39;ve just netted one some top of the
fried off to you and that&#39;s not an
option
don&#39;t check out and there was this
five-second gap between my last
conscious boat and the shutting of my
whilst I&#39;m a dominant on mood and an
inner voice whispered to me to no longer
waste time to no longer wait on life to
be reminded once again because they
whispered to you those reminders are
whispers to all the time that life is
waiting on you to act too instead of
waiting like a half person who waits for
another hot person to make them feel
whole again I had to make a subconscious
choice to just be my fullest RISM think
of it like this it&#39;s always a
five-second window period the smallest
moment when you move from an idea you&#39;re
having your head to acting on the right
there think of the monkey bars used to
play on or the trees you you might have
climbed during your childhood as you
transition from one bar or branch on the
tree you reach up for another and there
are a few seconds between them that you
have a choice to make a choice to let go
or a choice to persist it&#39;s your choice
if we want to shape our future we can&#39;t
afford to wait constantly on hold by the
way how has automotive been working for
you so far we have to make the conscious
choice of acting now and realizing the
change that we want to see in this
country in our world in order to do that
we have to take chances chances to have
the conversations we&#39;ve never taken the
chance to have difficult but honest and
open conversations between each other
and in this nation and I learned that
lesson when my mother passed
when I was 21 I&#39;ll never forget that the
final moments I had with her alongside
her bed in the hospital and I knew that
she was eating and I had a choice to
weep and be angry and to say why are you
going with a gun on me and I said no
let&#39;s have that DMC that&#39;s longer with
you that deep meaningful conversation
and it&#39;s a DMC who&#39;s country has been
waiting to have my mother&#39;s death had an
impact on me because make me realize how
easily you can do someone like this and
the privilege that comes with heavy
people like that the privilege that
comes with having the kind of country we
have that we so take for granted
particular has privileged people that is
why we must not take the prison for
granted our prison informs us and shapes
us the same can be said for our country
perhaps the shapers of the future we
need to take the chance to fix our
broken homes to uplift our communities
and develop the relationships between
and amongst each other South Africans
from all walks of life perhaps this is
our assignment as individuals and as a
nation I believe that you personal
identity and your story is part of the
bigger picture and a collective story
and by a number of things there&#39;s no
single thing that informs you press my
identity it could be your geographical
location it could be your ancestry it
could be your history it could be your
nationality or socialization but it&#39;s
also the personal choices you make as
individual as a self-proclaimed
non-water Docs young white South African
I&#39;m always by choice attempt to live and
pink definitely because I&#39;m a parent of
personal choice and difference
I was socialized to be conservative and
to think and feel a certain way about
other groups of people but I made a
conscious decision to be liberal and to
embrace people from different walks of
life to respect them and treat them as
my equal
it was a choice a choice to unlearn
relearn and learn constantly have you
grown up around difficulty I&#39;ve come to
believe that we can&#39;t just accept people
do what is easy because to who much is
given much is required
people have a question how do you do
what you do why are you the way about
and I often see this in the facial
expression of my fellow indigenous
African brothers and sisters in the
township when instead of greeting them
in English I greet them in the
indigenous language so I&#39;ll be walking
or walking instead of hello men it&#39;s one
of my old I need one of man and it a
creeper Morrises and in a box they walk
a few meters they turn around just to
check as the little things like that and
I&#39;ve learned through those experiences
not just betraying myself my unique self
weatherman occipital unaccepted I&#39;m a
man and I&#39;m a Trinity not only learning
in the shadows someone actually awaits
inspiration through myself
so let me tell you this you&#39;ll know when
you on the right path when you don&#39;t
betray yourself when you don&#39;t have to
negotiate your sense of integrity or
compromise who you are when you&#39;re
taking on a conscious choice to take a
chance to do to yourself
by the way to work in the area of your
destiny you can&#39;t be limited to working
with people who look only like you if
only the exclusionists the sixes the
racists in our country actually
understood that we&#39;re so easily
distracted by comparisons the
comparisons we make and it changed let
me resist there will be a life being and
doing nothing and so because we don&#39;t
have potential or tenant but the
potential and Italian life changes there
it&#39;s waiting on us to act wait it was to
pay attention waiting for us to make a
choice to act it which used to wait
anyway for the why or where to live you
are not quite sure the talent you
possess is not to be just disregarded
over a little bit or ever in mind in
effect whilst you are busy always
wondering about the day what will they
do or say or think have you ever
considered that what you possess is a
unique individual is actually what they
need to find peace you have to give go
of the armor that you so dearly hold on
to to defend and protect yourself from
change you need that this means that you
always have to feel accepted will make
you so invisible in this world and if
you are invisible in then to this room
how will you shake the moocher never lie
to people who are acceptance because you
haven&#39;t yet
accepted yourself nothing runs deeper
than the pain of not letting yourself
know that when you&#39;ve made your choice
it is Providence that is your guide
we&#39;re very different your fate lies in
that and that with choices there&#39;s no
in-between you have to live your
teaching by the way the world has enough
preachers and masquerades what we need
are people who actually live what they
teach to be hesitant or silent is a
choice traced back all the times way you
hesitated or you remain quiet when you
should attempt and see how we define
change changing your life and changing
the lives of others unless something
drastic happens to us we seem to take
for granted that tomorrow may not come
that we may just a pass out on the
chance to make a choice that could have
brought about positive change
you are one choice away from a totally
different circumstance life is painful
we all live painful experiences in our
lives
Matthew quietly you might speak openly
about it but today everyone&#39;s gone
through something but suffering is a
choice if you change some of your
choices you might just change everything
including the responses to the pain we
experience not another although there
will be people who despise you for your
courage your strength your success your
tenacity you constantly choose how you
use your energy space and time to
respond to that if you keep letting
people treat you the way they do to
become a culture if we keep leading
racist and sexist treats our country the
way they do it will become culture if we
allow others to do what they want it
will become normalized it will become
toxic have no doubt that your personal
story with fire nation
and shake this future that&#39;s your power
that&#39;s your weapon we&#39;re and we&#39;re all
human beings at the end of the day we
all need confidence confidence are there
for you they pick you up they lift you
they want you to succeed let me share us
with you
be wary of those who remain silent when
you share good news because those are
not your confidence but when last we you
our country learned another when last if
we make a choice to be confidence for
South Africa take a chance on caring for
yourself you&#39;ll never be in the prime
position to take care of others unless
you take care of yourself align himself
with your purpose
take a chance from your dream it&#39;s scary
because you might think you will fail
but how many dreams like the graveyard
because people gave up on it you can
make more money but you can&#39;t make more
time stop wishing start doing leave the
change we need the bigger the chance you
take the bigger change you move Eve make
that bigger choice
