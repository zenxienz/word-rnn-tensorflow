this is a story about Murray and John
and their children Joe and Linda and
whilst they are a fictional family their
story is all too real for far too many
families living in New Zealand
John is violent to Murray
he beats threatens and humiliates her he
controls her our solution for Marie is
refuge but it is my firm belief that
refuge is fundamentally the wrong model
for us to be using in response to
violence against women in New Zealand
today I&#39;ll explain why but first it
helps to understand how he got here in
1973 rosemary Howard and Diane Shannon
became the public faces of a group of
radical feminist women who took a stand
to stop violence against women by
co-founding New Zealand&#39;s first refuge
it was called Christchurch woman&#39;s
refuge at the time many New Zealanders
including some pretty powerful people
actively resisted the call for violence
against women to be recognised as a
significant social injustice instead
these people preferred the problem to
remain behind closed doors in the
following years what became known as the
refuge movement coalesced women
organized marched and protested more
refuges were founded by 2009 there were
50 refuges in towns and cities around
the country since 1973 refuges have
sheltered and supported thousands of
women and children and still today
refuge symbolizes our mainstream
response to violence against women so
why do I believe the refuge model isn&#39;t
working for us
well far from achieving our founders
vision New Zealand today has the highest
reported rate of intimate partner
violence in the developed world last
year New Zealand police
investigated almost a hundred and twenty
thousand reports of domestic violence
it&#39;s estimated that about another half a
million went unreported half of New
Zealand&#39;s homicides are carried out by a
family member
doing more of what we&#39;ve always done is
not going to change this building more
refuges is not going to change this six
years ago I became chief executive at
Christchurch Women&#39;s Refuge as you know
today we called Aviva and I have been
spending the past six years coming to
understand why the refuge model isn&#39;t
working the vast majority of women who
are experiencing violence today will
never call refuge one reason for this is
that domestic violence is a form of
entrapment let&#39;s come back to Murray and
John but first I would like to
acknowledge the violence that takes
place in same-sex relationships male and
female and that straight men can
experience violence from a female
partner and also like to acknowledge
that not all violence within families is
intimate partner violence children can
be violent to their parents and siblings
to each other but I&#39;m telling Maurice
and John&#39;s story today because the
majority of domestic violence in New
Zealand is perpetrated against women by
a heterosexual partner when John starts
to suspect that Murray may be thinking
of leaving he threatens more violence
not only against Murray but also the
children her parents even himself
anything to stop her from going anywhere
next John is apologetic generous and
affectionate he talks emotionally about
how much he loves Murray and the
children of how he could not live
without them of how she could not live
without him Murray doubts had judge
and she feels guilt and a strong sense
of responsibility to keep the family
together
she stays soon John is violent again
when he thinks Marie may be thinking
about leaving he threatens more violence
his violence escalates he repeats these
behaviors sometimes in front of the
children until it becomes a sustained
pattern of abuse Marie becomes isolated
shamed and dependent almost half of New
Zealand&#39;s intimate-partner homicides
happen at the time of actual or intended
separation Marie&#39;s entrapped if we were
to ask Marie why do you stay her answer
will be simple I have no choice but in
the public narrative about domestic
violence this question is still front
and center why does she stay because
refuge is still our front and center
response to domestic violence we
collectively reason that Marie can leave
and therefore she should leave when we
do this we start to make Marie
responsible for stopping the violence
and if she doesn&#39;t leave we start to
blame her for the violence just like
John now everyone is nicely insulated
from any responsibility to stop the
violence I&#39;m insulated you&#39;re insulated
and John is insulated why else
don&#39;t the vast majority of women in New
Zealand who experienced domestic
violence ever call refuge when we
explored this question in 2013 women
told us that they wouldn&#39;t reach out to
refuge because they found it shaming and
stigmatizing that they didn&#39;t identify
with the concept of refuge or the word
victim because shaming language stops us
from reaching out for help it sustains
the social isolation that keeps us
vulnerable to violence vulnerable to
experiencing violence and using violence
this makes our language
of the problem nonetheless victim and
refuge are the most common words in New
Zealand&#39;s domestic violence language
another common word is perpetrator
it&#39;s our short term for people like John
like victim this word defines a person
by their behaviors rather than their
human potential
once again shaming words stop us from
connecting with the hearts and minds of
the vast majority of men who are using
violence using our words people using
violence instead of perpetrator does not
minimize a person&#39;s responsibility for
their violent behaviors but it does see
and talk to their human potential to
become safe shame keeps violence behind
closed doors many men who use violence
don&#39;t actually identify as perpetrators
many identify as victims many men have
told us that shame fear and admitting
they have a problem is the hardest thing
to do though we say it&#39;s okay to ask for
help most men won&#39;t find it if they do
as a result of the sustained focus on
refuge and the implied and real
responsibilities this places on women to
take action to stop the violence we have
invested little to nothing in innovative
services for men who are using or at
risk of using violence services that are
deeming engage men early are hopeful and
effective our focus on refuge also means
that we have overlooked the place where
the vast majority of violence against
women and children actually takes place
our homes throughout John&#39;s abuse Murray
believes that her only option is refuge
she believes that in order to become
safe she must leave home leave John
remove the kids from
school maybe even become homeless as a
result she and the children experienced
many years of abuse behind closed doors
let&#39;s remember this is precisely where
the original opponents of Christchurch
Women&#39;s Refuge wanted the problem to
stay wanted Murray to stay but what if
Murray decided to take the risk and
leave anyway well as we know Murray and
John have two children
Linda is 8 and Joe is 12 Joe is a boy
boys who are 11 or older are not allowed
in many refuges disrespect this reflects
a perspective that women and girls in
refuge will be will feel unsafe around
Joe because he is an adolescent boy from
Joe&#39;s perspective he is being blamed for
his father&#39;s behavior but Joe&#39;s
exclusion from refuge isn&#39;t the only
reason why it&#39;s not working for Murray
over the years alcohol has become her
friend helping her to manage her fear
and anxiety and whilst this is not at
all uncommon for women who are
experiencing abuse it does significantly
increase their vulnerability to violence
nonetheless women with multiple issues
domestic violence alcohol misuse mental
ill-health are commonly excluded from
refuge we describe these women as
challenging so there we go again with
our victim blaming we have failed to
develop effective alternatives for women
and men with multiple issues and then we
make them the problem refuge was a very
significant development in New Zealand
in 1973 for women already experiencing
violence and please hear me when I say
this now it remains an important social
service today
the problem is we simply haven&#39;t evolved
or kept
with contemporary social values whilst
today I believe we would all agree it is
not OK for Joe to have to leave school
because he&#39;s being bullied by another
pupil it seems it is okay for him to
have to leave home with his mum and his
sister because they are experiencing
domestic violence New Zealand prides
itself on being the first country in the
world to grant women the vote and
although this happened way back in 1893
we still talk about it lots
it symbolizes our national identity as a
fair and progressive society yet as Kate
Shepherd campaigned for suffrage the
process of colonization was laying the
grounds for generations of social
cultural and economic inequalities for
Maori today Maori are more than twice as
likely to experience intimate partner
violence Maori children are six times
more likely to die of child abuse or
neglect the suicide rate amongst young
Maori men is two-and-a-half times that
of their non-maori counterparts but this
is not about being Maori it&#39;s about the
enduring effects of violence the
enduring intergenerational effects of
colonization in 1973 the foundation of
Christchurch Women&#39;s Refuge symbolized
the emergence of a social movement to
build a fairer New Zealand free from all
forms of oppression not only violence
against women as the number of refuges
grew what was known as the women&#39;s
liberation movement became known as the
refuge movement and so I wonder if this
was when our vision shifted from
liberation to protection from a struggle
for equality to a struggle for funding
this is why as a feminist I believe the
concept of ref
huge in contemporary New Zealand society
is paradoxical and unjust women are not
intrinsically vulnerable to violence
vulnerability to violence is the
consequence of extrinsic inequalities
remove these and we remove the need for
protection I passionately believe that
ending violence against women and
children in New Zealand is fully
achievable so how do we get back on
track let&#39;s imagine we begin by changing
our mindset from believing that women
need protection to believing in
everyone&#39;s potential to become a great
parent a great partner a great citizen
if offered the right support at the
right time in the right way
imagine if we shifted our focus from
refuge to homes from individuals to
families - sooner rather than later
imagine if we provided support for all
members of your family children young
people women and men people experiencing
violence people using violence and
people with experiences of both imagine
if children came first imagine if we
changed our attitude it&#39;s not your
responsibility to reach out to us it&#39;s
ours to reach out to you and if a
service we&#39;re providing is not working
we ask you how we could improve rather
than question your motivation and
commitment imagine if you could get all
the support you need through one very
welcoming front door support with all
forms of domestic violence and mental
health problems drug and alcohol
problems housing employment microfinance
support with your kids imagine if every
home in New Zealand were safe this is
the approach Aviva is taking since 2011
we have been reimagining and
transforming what it looks like to
support families
and end violence but we&#39;re gonna have to
be honest with each other we are not
going to achieve this vision unless we
commit together to ending the inequality
drivers of New Zealand&#39;s violence social
cultural and economic and this is not
only Aviva&#39;s role it&#39;s all of ours
community political and bureaucratic I
first visited New Zealand in 2005 I came
for a Mental Health Conference and was
really struck by the number of
presenters who talked about out of her
who talked about love her ahah seemed to
have much more power depth and
authenticity than the professionalized
notion of compassion and empathy I was
trained and bound to practice in my
first trade as a nurse i raha seemed to
talk to acceptance of others
self-awareness the power of
vulnerability and mutual responsibility
it&#39;s why I came back to New Zealand it&#39;s
why I&#39;m here
imagine if we brought out of her -
overcoming UVA New Zealand&#39;s violence
imagine if we bought love so for every
family in New Zealand today and tomorrow
Kitty hide-a-key 30 he we can ascend the
summit thank you
