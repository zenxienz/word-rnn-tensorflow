you
good evening friends my topic today is
saving and investments it&#39;s a bit
illogical because right now we are in a
festive month and right now everybody is
in the mood of spending and what I&#39;m
going to talk about is saving so right
now we are all surrounded with plenty of
offers so we all have these offers on
our smartphones as well as on our emails
so every place where we socialize I also
have two offers for you today my first
four offer for you is I&#39;m going to give
you one crore 25 lakh rupees and what I
want in return is 125 rupees how many of
you would be ready for this offer please
raise your hands please most of y&#39;all
right okay now for the second offer now
in my second offer I am going to give
you 125 rupees and in return you have to
give me 1 crore 25 lakh rupees now how
many for this offer nobody okay so today
I am going to share an idea with you
with which by a mere 125 rupees you can
build a corpus of 1 crore 25 lakh rupees
so it&#39;s a bit illogical but let&#39;s see
how it proceeds ok so let&#39;s start with
some stats now there&#39;s a recent report a
survey which was published recently by
HSBC this survey tells us that 65
percent of the working class if given a
choice is aged between 40 and 45 they
would like to go for retirement in the
next 5 years and the reason as to why
they would go for retirement is maximum
percent of them 43 percent of them say
that it is the work pressure due to
which they would like to go for early
retirement so it is the work stress the
mental stress that they go through is
the main reason a large number of them
are also cited reasons as spending
time with their family as to why they
would like to go for early retirement
and an equal large number of them have
said that the this early retirement
would give them an opportunity to pursue
other interests that they have
so basically worldwide people have seen
early retirement as a chance of
reinventing themselves and starting new
getting into a new beginning and the
global data as well suggests the same
thing so if you look at global data in
Argentina the 78% of people who have the
same opinion in France it is 77% in
China it is 75 and so is with UK so
basically we all would like to retire
early and we all would like to retire
rich but then there is another there&#39;s a
saying perception and reality are
different things so this is perception
now let&#39;s look at the reality the report
also suggests the same report suggest
that there are a few hurdles which are
there in front of these pre retirees or
people who are thinking of an early
retirement and the main hurdles are 54%
of them say that if they go for an early
retirement
then they may find it difficult to
sustain they may find it difficult to
survive they will go through financial
stress or they&#39;ll struggle financially
and therefore they may not opt for an
early retirement a large number of
people around 27% of them say that they
have dependents so they have family
members who are dependent on their
income and therefore they may not early
retirement not be the right choice for
them and an equal number of him them say
that due to debt that they have if the
income stops then repaying that debt
would become a bit difficult for them
okay a report which was recently
published by the Reserve Bank of India
this tells us that Indians as they grow
older they accumulate debt now this is
something which is very serious 77
percent of Indians never ever think of
retiring so is it that they love
are they satisfied with it no they
cannot they cannot think of retiring
because they have they don&#39;t have that
option if they retire then it would be
difficult for them to survive and
therefore they don&#39;t have an option
they are going to work till the last day
now if you look at this pie chart here
this pie chart will tell you the
seriousness of the issue seventy-seven
percent of Indians do not plan for their
retirement only 23 percent of them are
planning or thinking of getting into a
plan for their future so this is serious
and this what makes it more serious is
this report by NSA so this is a health
care report the cost of health in India
if you look at this report this report
tells you that a large number of people
do not go for medical advice because of
one reason and that is financial
constraint a large number of people go
for medical treatment based on money
that they have borrowed from friends
relatives and others so this is very
serious an important thing which we all
need to consider here is life expectancy
whenever we have to ever think about
future we think only till the age of 60
there we forget that we are going to
live more number of years the life
expectancy in India in 1960 was 41 in
2015 it was 68 in the next 20 years the
life expectancy in India is going to be
80 so therefore if you&#39;re going to think
about the future then you need to think
for those 20 more years that you&#39;re
going to live and to it after retirement
your expenses don&#39;t go down they go up
in form of medical expenses okay so then
everybody who&#39;s sitting here today in
the next 30 years by so by 2050 we all
will be reaching our retirement age of
60 and therefore this topic is the most
important topic for all of us today
now if you look at this slide in the
next five to
seven years there&#39;s going to be a
population explosion India is going to
be the number one country in the world
in terms of population so we&#39;re going to
or take China anytime between 2022 and
2024 everybody who&#39;s sitting here today
by 2050 we all are gone towards going to
go towards our retirement or maybe cross
60 so around 32 million Indians are
going to reach that level and therefore
this topic is very important so then
what why is this why are these
statistics showing us a grim picture now
the first reason for this is so we all
say have no doubt about it but our
savings are in to assets where which do
not match the inflation so what is
inflation inflation is nothing but the
general increase in price so your rupee
is continuously developing so therefore
you need the current inflation is around
5% so you need to be invested in asset
classes which are growing more than 5%
now if you look at this an expense of
20,000 today by 2050 is going to be a
lakh of rupees
what is the reason one reason that is
inflation at your retirement you are
going to require a corpus of 1.5 to 2
crores to sustain your further life
right and the medical inflation today in
India is the highest around 12 to 12.5
percent so the regular inflation is 5
percent but the medical inflation is
12.5 percent therefore this is very
important the second reason as to why
people go through problems is investment
in household savings so like traditional
it has been going on if you have got
money what do you do with it
invest in a fixed deposit but today the
interest rates are going down and your
fixed deposits are not able to generate
wealth when compared to the inflation
that is there right so fixed deposits is
the first thing second is gold third is
insurance all these asset classes are
generating a return of 5 to 6% so
what&#39;s the solution the solution is
investing in equity and investing in
mutual funds right but then why don&#39;t
people do it people don&#39;t do it because
of lack of awareness I don&#39;t have
knowledge so when there&#39;s lack of
awareness it&#39;s like this story the
elephant and six blind men so then when
you don&#39;t have knowledge you feel
getting into the equity markets or
getting into mutual fund investments is
like gambling it&#39;s like speculation so
will my money will be safe you have
plenty of doubts that come to your mind
and therefore you don&#39;t don&#39;t come here
so then what is the solution the
solution is only one thing and that is
knowledge now if you look at this recent
survey that was done by Aviva in in this
survey they have got these two index the
first index is the dream index means the
number of Indians who are aware of their
life goals and the second one is the
plan index which means the number of
Indians who are prepared for their
future or who are prepared or equipped
to achieve the goals now we all have
read and we all have heard that dreamers
are achievers right but in in our case
in case of the Indians it&#39;s not so 61%
of Indians
dream how many achieve only 24 percent
so this again is very serious okay so
then why does this happen
I believe this happens because of one
reason and that is Indian mystery of
life so what is the Indian mystery of
life Indian mystery of life is till 25
we study so we complete our education
then between 25 and 29 we start earning
so I getting I get a job or maybe I
start a business so I start earning
small then between 29 and 32 I get
married means what I&#39;m increasing my
expenses and later on between 32 and 38
then we have children so your expenses
are going to rise further and when you
are at the age of 40 your children start
going to school and that is the time
when you realize the importance of
saving
and by the age of 40 half of your life
is already gone now you have to prepare
for your retirement and you&#39;ve got only
20 years to prepare right therefore it
is very serious so then and to add to
this to add to this India is young plus
in day spending so in this in days young
today the median age in India today is
only 27 today I remember my childhood
days when we used to wait for that one
day throughout the year when we could
officially go out with our parents for
shopping so it used to be some festive
period right but today we all have got
smartphones and we all all our
smartphones are loaded with those
shopping apps and we tend to buy things
which are not even required so maybe we
shop everyday right so so then another
important thing is changing lifestyle so
every weekend we have to go out we go to
malls we go to restaurants so the
lifestyle also is changing so basically
we are young and we are also spending
and the most important thing is will act
seriously related to saving an
investment why because we feel that this
is something meant for our parents so
the day I become a parent I will also
start it but by then it will already be
very late okay so then what I did was
when my son became 10 years old I took
him to a bank we opened an account and
every week I started taking him to the
bank to deposit a mere a small amount of
125 rupees so every week we departed
deposited 125 rupees at the end of one
month I started in a sigh before him of
500 rupees so then he had a lot of
questions why are you doing this what&#39;s
going to happen so I told him that she
your money is going to grow we are
investing so how can it grow is it a
sapling which is going to become a plant
I said yes when you nurture it will
flourish and one year later when this
amount of 6,000 rupees
became 6400 that was a WoW moment for
him and I believe we all can give a
moment to ourselves and our children by
doing what by educating them educating
of what what is right and what is not so
therefore the solution on all the things
that we have discussed three points the
first one is start investing at an early
age use the power of compounding and the
third most important thing is start
educating your children related to
saving an investment right from the age
of 10 so that when they grow up they
will also be able to pass it on to their
children
so how does saving early help saving
early helps in this way now if you look
at this slide now there are three people
who have started at three different time
frames so the first person starts in
saving and investing at the age of
twenty rupees so 125 rupees every week
500 rupees a month started at the age of
20 till his retirement grows up to
become 30 lakh rupees in till retirement
now if you look at that the the last
person who started investing at the age
of 40 till his retirement his corpus
grows to only three and a half lakh
rupees a difference of ten times between
20 years
so therefore this tells you that you
have to start investing at an early age
it could be as low as 125 rupees a week
higher the better the second important
thing is now if you look at this slide
this tells you our goal of 1 crore 25
lakh rupees if you start at birth you
will have to invest only 326 rupees if
you start at the age of 10 you will have
to invest only 850 rupees so on and so
forth so till the time so if you think
of starting at the age of 50 you will
have to invest 62 thousand rupees per
month to reach this target so what is
easy easy is starting early and
investing consistently that is what is
important why does this happen this
happens because of the power of
compounding so if you look at this slide
in the initial years you don&#39;t see your
money growing but in the later years see
you see your money growing by leaps and
bounds so like they say the initial
years
the years when your patience is going to
be tested but in the later years your
patience is going to reward you
handsomely that is how it is so now
friends I want to know how many of you
can save 125 rupees a week please raise
your hands
everybody wow that&#39;s a very great
response that gives me a lot of energy I
believe what we should be doing is we
should be passing on this message not to
our relatives but to our friends as well
as our colleagues and anybody and
everybody whom you meet pass it on to
them if everybody does this we will not
only build an India or will it will not
only help people achieve financial
freedom but it will also help us build
the next generation which is strong
financially and on a strong footing
therefore I believe whatever we have
discussed is truly logical thank you
friends thank you very much
[Applause]
