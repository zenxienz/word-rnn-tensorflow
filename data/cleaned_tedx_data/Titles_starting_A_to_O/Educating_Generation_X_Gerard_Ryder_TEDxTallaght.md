good evening it&#39;s great to be here
bit nervous but really good to be here
so what I hope to do today is to tell
you a small story a short story and it&#39;s
about our future as seen through the
eyes of young children especially the
young children of South County Dublin so
one of the things that we know about the
future is that it will be technological
we know it will be advanced we also know
we have a feel for the fact that
technology is advancing at an
ever-increasing rate now you would think
being an engineer and talking to
students about the future of Engineering
and Technology that I&#39;d be quite
comfortable with this concept of the
future the technological future however
one of the things I am struck by is just
how fast technology is moving so I will
talk to students all the time about
their role in the future as a
professional engineer but I am truly
afraid of just how fast it moves when I
first went into cata into the college or
university computers were just arriving
now we have computing devices nearly
everywhere and you can access the
internet almost anywhere that you are
through your handheld devices now one of
the other things that I do
as part of my my job my career is to try
to encourage young children to take up a
career in stem so one of the things I
have to do as part of that is to read
reports that talk about why children
choose stem so science technology
engineering and mathematical disciplines
and again one of the thing that strikes
a little bit of fear into my heart is
when you read reports that say that
depending on where a child lives so
their geographical location depending on
their sex whether they&#39;re male or female
depending on the if you like the skills
the the interest in stem around them has
a massive impact on whether they will
actually choose the STEM disciplines so
one of the things that these reports
found is that science capital if you
like the science interest the knowledge
the skills that Sorel
a child has a massive influence upon
whether they will choose a future career
in stem
now also slightly worrying is that
children are making that decision to
follow a stem career very very early so
if a child has chosen or in a high
science capital family and they choose
stem by the age of about 10 they will
generally tend to persist with that
decision if they choose non-stem they
will also tend to persist in that
decision the worrying thing is that if a
child&#39;s from a low science capital
family does not choose by the age of 10
then their to the stem discipline by the
age of 10 they&#39;re unlikely then to
choose a career in stem so it&#39;s
incredibly difficult to change their
minds once they start to enter the
junior and the Leaving Cert cycle if we
bring this a little bit more local in
2016 of the students who took the
leaving ster Leaving Cert 56% of those
progressed on to third level now that
doesn&#39;t mean only 56 been some of them
went to the UK or other countries some
of them didn&#39;t quite pass and had to go
back and retake some subjects that
number that base number hides a huge
diversity in progression to third level
now let&#39;s bring that even more local so
we look around South County Dublin if
you look at the now I&#39;m gonna call them
more affluent that may not be the case
in all circumstances but the more
affluent regions in Dublin you will see
massive progression rates University
eighty ninety percent and more if you
then come a little bit closer to South
County Dublin the areas within and
around South County Dublin those rates
fall to forty to fifty percent now that
really scares me because we need huge
numbers of students doing choosing STEM
disciplines in order to sustain our
technological future so what we need is
a method away an initiative that allows
us to try and attract students to the
STEM disciplines but uses something that
every child has and that is their innate
curiosity okay so I am really lucky I
work with a really committed team of
people that we put
together over the last year so obviously
Institute of Technology teller where I
work but also teller library which is
part of the South County Dublin Library
Network
you&#39;ve got firaga and you&#39;ve got project
42 now Niall is going to to speak later
about project 42 and really interested
in his initiative developed in the UK
that is showing real promise in helping
students and especially girls to choose
the STEM disciplines now we were funded
by Science Foundation Islands and again
that was really important to validate
the kinds of things that we were saying
because science foundation came along
said yes we believe in this team we&#39;re
gonna give you money to try and prove
this out to test that as a feasibility
now over the last nine months I have
been really lucky to work with groups of
people from the different groups so what
we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve put together at the
moment a package of initiatives that
we&#39;ve used over those months to try and
encourage more and more students and
more and more girls to try and take up
stem and especially in the more
disadvantaged areas of South County
Dublin the very first thing that we did
is we knew that both Fraga and the
libraries were really active in the way
that they were trying to encourage
students into STEM and especially in
areas of Clondalkin Clondalkin
so one of the first things we want to do
was to support the work they were doing
by putting things like 3d printers kind
of rearranging their digital learning
space so that that could they we could
support the work that they were doing in
that so in that space we put the 3d
printers we were kind of using those
during the summer for the camps and the
various other activities that we that we
did over the last nine months we also
did I think this was one of the first
events we did something called the
Design Academy now that name was only
recently come to be applied to that
method but what we did is we bought
companies people from companies from the
Dublin region we had IKEA and a guy
called Lauren Morahan who is from a chef
in the chops group so the the healthy
restaurants that in in the square and
other areas and what we did is we were
taking everyday engineering problems and
we were and societal problems and we
were putting them up to the children and
saying what do you think the solution to
this is that was part of that
we got them to do is to design small
little water gardens where you could
grow mint and other herbs and lettuce in
the kitchen at home so you would reduce
in theory food waste but they got to
think about things like sustainable
approaches and how they can be better at
not trying out food at home so it&#39;s a
really interesting way of looking at the
problems through their eyes the project
for tea camps project food sue camps I&#39;m
not going to say much about because Maya
loves he&#39;s going to talk about those
later but this was a really enthused
together really enthusiastic group of
company representatives including Nile
from Transdev who&#39;s a really good friend
of ours to come and talk to the students
about if you like issues within society
everyday issues within society and then
to ask the students or the kids to use
Design Thinking which is a new approach
from the US to try and tackle those
problems using their curiosity their
imagination and then getting to show us
and their parents exactly what they
think the future solutions are it was a
really really good experience during the
summer the other thing I am incredibly
proud to do is to work more closely with
some of the other groups so one of the
things that I&#39;m doing with Barbara
where&#39;s Barbara thank you a hi Barbara
trom Teller library is to try and take
3d printing primary research and try and
build if you like reality back stories
behind children&#39;s literature so we&#39;re
using a number of books include the guns
of Easter we&#39;re using and there&#39;s a
picture book by Ryan Tom body on the
visit of President Kennedy to Ireland
there are other other books I can&#39;t
remember the other book so but there are
other books as well and what we do is we
build boxes Curiosity boxes or 3d images
of primary research back stories behind
all of these things and then we immerse
the students are the children in that
story behind the book if you like and
what we&#39;re finding is that it is an
incredible way of getting students
interested in both literacy and
technology almost at the same time and
you can apply it to almost any area of
technology science literature it is a
really interesting approach to using
technology in that way I&#39;m really proud
of that one and then the last thing that
we
doing is we&#39;re trying to design games
that we can take out to schools so that
we can try and get these approaches out
in kind of hit wider audiences because
of course while we do camps that have 12
15 20 students in them that&#39;s still only
a tiny fraction of the children we need
to reach in order to build the science
capital of South County Dublin and then
the rest of Ireland so one of the things
I just like to leave you with before I
finish up is we know the future will be
technological we know it will be
advanced many of the problems that we
will face we have absolutely no idea
what they are but one of the things I am
no longer afraid about is what will
happen in the future because if you look
at these issues through the eyes of the
children especially the children of
South County Dublin you find that that
future is safe that they will protect
that future develop that future so I&#39;m
no longer afraid
[Applause]
