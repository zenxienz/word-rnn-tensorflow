I&#39;m Jordan Baumgartner and my design was
based off of the effects of global
warming on zebras the size of their
stripes are larger in warmer climates
and smaller and cooler climates and the
stripe protects and insulates their body
from the heat and also the biting flies
and I incorporate incorporated that into
my design within the outer shell of the
kimono representing a world without
global warming and then the inside
representing those stripes in the world
we live in
[Music]
hi my name is Rachel Jacobs and my
global warming that I based my project
off of is the ice caps and how they
melting and I designed my dresses that
they would have a small top and a very
large bottom and more fuller skirts to
represents I caps that you don&#39;t boy see
so you see the top of them which is very
small at the tops of my dresses and very
large at the bottom where you will not
see
[Music]
hi my name is Adam Brewster and my look
is based off climate change and the
issue of overexposure for natural
habitats for animals all over the world
there&#39;s like multiple species that are
simply I&#39;m dying out because their
habitat their natural habitats are
unlivable due to overexposure and so I&#39;m
gonna focus in on that for this look and
I kind of turned it in with my colors I
chose like a dusty blue and kind of a
rusty like brownish orange red or
something and I wanted to use those
colors because the water is evaporating
in these environments are becoming like
desert dwellings when they weren&#39;t
before and today MMO sign able to
survive so you said with the colors I
wanted to make a statement obviously so
they made the top a little overdramatic
oversized really big off the shoulders
and I had no shirt underneath to show
overexposure or essence and me cutouts
on the pants I went there would be a lot
of skin showing just sure that we&#39;re
like these animals or their habitats are
exposed and they&#39;re not able to live in
them anymore and I kept the pants pretty
simple just slam and cropped like about
the ankle to show that the water is
hi my name is Jessica Cruz and my dress
is basically inspired under air
pollution and I can you can see that
reflected in there in the color because
thumb I feel like one of the most things
that is affecting a bulging Mistah smoke
and you can see that smoke is great so
that translates on that and also on the
neck piece you can see like I think that
whenever you have something really close
to your neck you feel you&#39;re choking and
that&#39;s the feel that you see whenever
you get to see you next
[Music]
my name is Anna hi notes I chose to look
at the melting of the icebergs icebergs
are melting off of glaciers at a more
rapid rate than ever before for my
garment I chose to make a large
structured skirt it has petals attached
all around it and they are burned to
make the melting my bodice has pointed
and sharp edges to represent how the
icebergs do not break off smoothly and
the neck base is also layered and burned
to also represent the melting of layers
and it is smaller than the skirt to
represent how most of the iceberg is
under the surface of the water
[Music]
name is Linda Nicholls and for my design
that Iowa is inspired by a water
pollution specifically just like oil
spills so in my garment I have a blue
dress that I can guide it and a house
like different shades of blue just kind
of representing it clean of water and
then on top of that I made a cloak it
has like ruffles and I dyed it black and
that supposed to represent just kind of
like polluting the water and it&#39;s kind
of especially resemble an oil spill
[Music]
you
