who scares you I don&#39;t mean what scares
you but what does the person look like
who gives you a pit in your stomach
makes you cross the street subvert eye
contact and maybe lock the doors in your
car a little faster fear is a natural
uncontrollable response but what we do
with that fear becomes a choice studies
now tell us that 98% of our brains work
unconsciously what affects our conscious
brain how do we process all of us
information from birth we are bombarded
with messages that our brain categorizes
and internalizes which affect our
thoughts and actions and all of us have
unconscious biases and if we are to
effectuate real authentic community
change in true community relationship
building we must all individually dig
deeper to understand what triggers our
fears especially when we&#39;re talking
about racism or any ism really I too
have a lot of unconscious bias teas just
the other day I was chatting it up with
the cashier at the grocery store who was
a young Asian man with no accent just
like me but I caught myself I felt my
brain being surprised that he had no
accent and I paused and I started to
have a conversation with myself right
then on why and when I took an implicit
association test which showed me that I
favor lighter skinned people over darker
skinned people I hit the pause button
again now I use this information to make
sure that when those opportunities
present themselves I don&#39;t slip back
into
unconscious bias personal interactions
with those who are different than us is
what dissipates that fear that not in
your stomach often times my friends tell
me I hear about Islam and Muslims in the
media and I know you&#39;re not like that as
an American Muslim I&#39;m here to tell you
that I am NOT the exception to the rule
I just happened to have become a person
that you&#39;ve interacted with who
contextualizes what it means to be an
American Muslim and now you&#39;re starting
to understand that the rhetoric that
you&#39;ve been hearing and possibly
internalizing is what is actually false
I am NOT the anomaly but the norm but
what happens when you live in a place
where you don&#39;t have the opportunity for
personal contact with someone who looks
or believes differently than you what
happens is that fear-mongering and
stereotypes slowly seep into our
discourse and slowly become true and
when faith leaders and elected officials
preach and legislate this fear it starts
to become right so it&#39;s no surprise that
the now identified Islamophobic Network
imports their fear filled messaging and
institutions into rural America where
there is essentially no probability of
humanizing the other this messaging is
working so well that since 2010 a
hundred and twenty anti-islamic bills
were introduced in 42 states and 15 such
hateful laws have been passed laws we
are again legislating fear and hate just
a different target I live in Sioux Falls
South Dakota there may be about two to
three Muslims in our state that&#39;s
literally point zero
zero 3% of our state&#39;s population and
not surprisingly South Dakota is one of
those 15 states which has passed anti
Sharia legislation in 2012 signed by our
current governor into law what is Sharia
law a question I get asked all the time
first it&#39;s a misnomer Sharia is not law
as we understand the US Constitution or
Civil Code Sharia are our guiding
principles just as the Ten Commandments
and love of mercy stories of love and
mercy Sharia teaches us to be good
people good stewards of this earth to
provide refuge to orphans to feed the
hungry dress modestly pay charity
worship God be a good person just like
every other religion does but what the
Islamic oves and the fear mongers will
have you believe as that Muslims we want
to enforce some sort of archaic penal
code of chopping off hands and heads
stoning people to death and taking away
women&#39;s rights and that our US
Constitution is in jeopardy of being
overtaken by these medieval practices by
the way those punishments or penal codes
are also fine it found in the Bible and
Torah if you know anything about
government or how constitutions are
amended you know that point zero zero
three percent of the population doesn&#39;t
have that political clout so this is
pure fear mongering hateful legislation
is garnering so much momentum in rural
America and it&#39;s now making appearances
in Washington DC
the Islamophobic networks main purpose
is to have you so scared of Islam and
Muslims they they want to legally D
legitimize a religion which is fourteen
centuries old stripping Muslims of our
founding principle
and protections of freedom of and
freedom from religion what is this
Islamophobic network since 2015 its
burgeoned into this 57 million dollar
industry the Center for American
Progress and the Haas Institute have
revealed a tightly knit collaboration of
foundations think-tanks media platforms
grassroots organizations elected
officials and figureheads many of whom
are former Muslims Islam evokes dream
come true and spreading fear in rural
America we need to understand that this
fear is being imported into rural
America to change the hearts and minds
of otherwise hard-working good
neighborly communities who just don&#39;t
have the exposure to Muslims in Islam as
practiced by 1.5 billion people
worldwide peacefully and lovingly this
past legislative session South Dakota
had to Islamophobic resolutions and I&#39;m
ecstatic to report to you that our
amazing
authentically intersectional coalition
defeated both of them for the first time
a coalition of immigrants refugees
Muslims and our beautiful allies showed
up together over and over to testify
against legislating hate the proponents
I&#39;d had a lobbyist from a known as llama
phobic anti-refugee hate group called
act for America
they even had an expert call in to the
committee hearing room from Sweden who
testified that 90% of the rapes in
Sweden are committed by Somali Muslim
men absurd
just the other day I was an event at an
event we&#39;re an adjunct professor from a
local university actually Korda that
statistic pay attention to Islamophobia
wherever you live here in South Dakota
we had a candidate for governor and for
Congress show up to a hate group event
and legislators are continuously
attending the over dozens of Asama
phobic speaker events held throughout
her state after my testimony and being
outspoken about Islamophobia wherever it
rears its ugly head elected officials
and those running for office have tried
to deal edge it omit my voice one
senator on Twitter called me a terrorist
sympathizer while another one accused me
of receiving funding from terrorist
organizations to do this work and on
Facebook a candidate for governor of
this state said that I should be tried
for treason for associating with
terrorists freedom of speech is surely a
two-way street
but these are provable blatant lies know
that Islamophobia is real and rampant
and I have three asks for you today be
self-reflective identify your biases and
work unchanging your response if you
don&#39;t have the opportunity to meet
diverse people find other ways to learn
about them through authentic sources and
most importantly speak out against
fear-mongering and hate of Islam Muslims
immigrants and refugees when it shows up
at your dinner table and at your
legislature we can no longer afford to
be bystanders to legislated hate be an
upstander and break the momentum of
Islamophobia and rural
America by supporting local
organizations that are doing this real
work before I close today I just have
one more question for you
do I scare you does this image cause
surprise give you a pit in your stomach
or maybe thoughts that I must somehow be
a pest if your answer is yes or maybe
now it&#39;s up to you to dig deeper to
figure out why or are you going to let
your fear influence your thoughts and
your actions or worse your unconscious
impact thank you
you
[Applause]
