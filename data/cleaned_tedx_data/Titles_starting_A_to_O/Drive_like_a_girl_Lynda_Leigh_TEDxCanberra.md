why is it an insult to be told you drive
like a girl I&#39;m a girl I Drive and in
fact I compete him for rallying and I&#39;ve
got some fantastic company this year
Molly Taylor won the Australian Rally
Championship the youngest driver to
driver to do so now you may think that
women driving women competing in
Motorsports
is a modern fan but actually we&#39;ve been
competing since we&#39;ve been competing
since nineteen well 1897 in France on
power tricycles isn&#39;t she gorgeous hi
guys and by 1999 we even had our own
auto race in the US where men were
driving even before we had the votes
when you think about it
motorsport is the only place I can think
of where men and women compete against
each other at the same time I personally
have found rally spot to be extremely
inclusive if this middle aged profoundly
deaf woman who couldn&#39;t even drive a
manual up until two years ago can
compete into an International Rally
event and as shown by the screens I
didn&#39;t come last
mmm-hmm now drive like a girl is a
uk-based car insurance company and they
have proven with the lure in car black
boxes that&#39;s women are indeed so for
drivers and in fact you get a lower
premium if you drive like a girl what I
worked out is that safety is based on
motivation not on skill consider this it
was Mary Anderson who invented the
windscreen wipers in 1992 and in 1909 a
lovely lady by the name of Dorothy
Levitt told her fellow lady drivers to
place their mirror compacts on the dash
to see the traffic behind them there by
inventing the rear-vision mirror crash
statistics and surveys revealed that
women are safer drivers because one we
don&#39;t initiate road rage that often -
we&#39;re less likely to drink and drive -
well three we have a longer attention
span actually that didn&#39;t prove it did
it and on top of that we learn and obey
the Volvo and because of our protective
maternal instincts we seem to care and
share for others on the road all these
things because of the lack of
testosterone now in Nellie&#39;s 4 there is
a saying to finish first first you must
finish and what that simply means is
there&#39;s no point in rushing through
events to only damage your car there is
your car it means you don&#39;t finish you
don&#39;t get your point and that&#39;s how you
lose the championship male valley
drivers have told me that they are
conscious the fact when they get
competitive
we may get confident and when they get
too focused on their speed that&#39;s when
maybe
instead trance Australia there were more
that&#39;s driving like a girl because we
outnumber them in by 124,000 and guess
what girls we&#39;re gonna outdrive them too
because we outlive them by five years I
personally plan to be driving for a very
long time at the moment I have I&#39;m sorry
my apologies I forgot about Michelle my
hero Michele Mouton she is the only
woman rally driver to win a World Rally
Championship and you know what she said
that her male competitors were
deliberately crashing into her because
she felt that you want to be overtaken
by a woman and that&#39;s the testosterone
talking now back to the statistics I
plan to be driving like Michelle
hopefully melis forever but also I can&#39;t
Lyon three cars I have my street car
it&#39;s purple my rally car and my classic
car but I can profess to you there&#39;s my
next purchase it worries me the most
it&#39;s for my 16 year old son because his
learner&#39;s permit next month
yeah my son my only child a
testosterone-filled boy on the line and
that worries me because 45% of our boys
between the age of 17 and 25 are killed
in road fatalities you know I can&#39;t
install a roll cage in his car I can&#39;t
search him up in the scheme of making me
a helmet but there&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t
do and yes teach him how to drive like a
girl
you
