being friends for giving me opposition
here what comes small any pretty - and
you predict what happens on the model I
eat - Anna complex samples which are
summarized by thoughtful sir
the first part is the even that I
attended when I Oct 2010 an Indian and
Indian banker was supported as a hit off
jigaboos natural plan development that
goes the significant felicitations and
impact Nietzsche
he will ask would his prediction support
the global markets the future world
economy and so on and so forth now this
gentlemen vehicle Chris Wilson
user IIT I am and a man and he will also
the head of the Southeast Asia region of
Citibank then he caught up the Lancer he
said he was working as far as pathetic
planning goofily Panther the lady you
had the early nineties then it&#39;s all
basu study the markets and lies the
economies and then make some future
predictions and to use physicians so
that the bank could implement them and
be prepared for the various dangers that
they foresee he said he had an
opportunity for going through their
fourth what they are prepared with
related even the early nineties
combining 2005 is it is hung his head in
shame they made more predictions some of
its came true but what they mr. Ross
they miss out on the emergence of
internet banking the most important
change that gave it the banking industry
by needs of each we consider whom move
funds pay cash
all this was lost they would buy the
fish they&#39;ll divide the summer biggest
bank in the food so he said you cannot
predict the prediction we said haha
let&#39;s go
the second incident but I will take you
from the boat as promised probably you
have heard about the name particularly
Kudo former Burstyn and - of Pakistan
when Buddha was born on january 19 20 hm
his mother motor to Paris Moscow
SiC he vigorous policy I saw I saw you
go to horse cock and drove the lady that
her son would become a great person
world no leader powerful person and you
acting world save by the age of 50
they lady asked him what about what
happens after the thief in the years
right I don&#39;t see anything
after it might be remarkable for
instance my dear friends but mrs. Bhutto
was sent to the gallows by customs
geographer to Pakistan then he was 50
years old so what do you believe the
group of the person that is super
experienced internet banking or an
astrologer who prophesize about the life
and times of a world leader with
remarkable accuracy I said later is like
you cannot predict tomorrow if you know
what is will be happen to all of us is
wait for it will happen we not both to
make it happen you don&#39;t have the Fox
you don&#39;t have any of these things that
are around us all this has come because
they are unsafe number tomorrow we want
to make tomorrow a better and more
comfortable day than what is when I was
told about what I use to speak about I
thought did I have a passion I suppose
this during my childhood this also in my
teenage this I thought I dreamt I read I
played cricket cricket for my life like
many other exists in my circle we all
had fun and we should play for India
nothing else but the law are the
thousands of similar angstrom they can
be more wanted to play for me you know
the story of such in the filter of hours
where we don&#39;t wanna cooperate who are
putting more length then we&#39;ll fill the
verse of practice lady for about four or
five years and made the grave
oh wait some of you know for all the
first first wicket is who did not make
international aid once you&#39;ll manage now
this is fail again it somewhere
have you good for those who didn&#39;t agree
at all
hopefully you haven&#39;t they were good
they made the sacrifices they have the
talent they put in the effort but
finally little list his second they
didn&#39;t make a great what happened
let&#39;s say buh-bye hasta la APPA or when
no one holds his booby missus it&#39;s our
ancient revelations of a person was
ready to cricket was devoted to people
who made sacrifices for Brigid
unfortunately they didn&#39;t know I speak
about sniffing a safe word passion nice
people would predictable I feel Miller&#39;s
life more than any others photo be
intricate essentially a battle between
bath and bought but do you find her the
bathroom is the Laura delicate he tests
the skills again 11th place for the
opposite side one of whom has the power
of it right similarly in life you come
alone you face the challenges alone you
may get support from your parents from
your spouse from experience from your
children and so on and so forth but when
it comes to a challenge you face it
alone say intricate you face the border
road all the way all the support this
will be later with support each
unlimitedly listen immediately with the
power as the polishing hands now what
happens if you follow your passion
without Hank the building blocks
I am sorry you why because of certain
things which we do so if your face what
are they fuck science tails what should
be prepared we all sing you prepared how
it is the preparation coming now when
you go for an exam you&#39;re prepared just
a little
don&#39;t you feel some amount of tension
within you when you go for Leahi
when you go for a sport you&#39;re also then
even bj much but with so many so much to
get inside and outside the country fill
that you always will then not in the
suburb many went out to patch that was
nervous energy
Vivi&#39;s does good because it releases
here to knock it and it&#39;s thoughts of
impose our mental and physical faculties
but there is something else we all
prefer what happen to come
the character mahabhava wonderful
warrior but at a difficult time in the
Mahabharata war he was affected by the
curse he spoke about what he had learned
they&#39;re all worried what happens if I
see what happens if I forget for I
studied so this is a small theater is
Las Venus but 10 times you find that
this guy watch it and over there is the
example of a equal player or math for us
he was excellent batsman made centuries
but it isn&#39;t complicated but when it
came to district 8 somehow equal it can
go this twenties and thirties in these
are just give the long opportune time
you played it you bath house on fire get
settled everything and then they finally
comes with the best sports iphone PR
hunka costs what do you think when you
go to battle it is massed is it I don&#39;t
want to speak what do you think when you
go to battle neck of the match I don&#39;t
think it it is I know I can do it for in
the last so this is the basic difference
becomes the essential thing when he went
to play little patch of ice with
non-state the size of this hoodie you go
through around the day you put your
clinic units you go and sit for sometime
near the beach you think about what you
will do tomorrow you think about
spoiling boundaries you speak about
scoring runs you think about the Chiefs
you get rid accommodative century you
think all of that you elevation over
that you keep it in your mind go to your
hotel and sleep and come back the next
day and bility comfort us exactly has he
goes food after the fact is he belch
decipher the pitch he thought made all
these positive thoughts these false
peacocks are it in his mind he felt his
leg next thing he went to find the
positive energy and his college teacher
that was the thirty point in his period
so what happens is that even if you are
prepared if you see your profile
physically off by where academies you
need to be mentally a team you to be
mentally prepared without mental
preparation the chance of failure
resolve is there second aspect is in
every day to handle failure while I say
if you handle
see here the sediment will occupy a flat
space in your mind as a calamity
some of the pickets probably the fish
Steven were treated for a long time they
never heard the worker will offer them
saying oh they are so cursed what
happens is it every time from a winning
situation that meant the semifinals are
before that they manage to Zeus
then he bequeathed this in grasp they
face when achieve it because have said
about your mental ability of a mental
energy being there at 50 kilometers the
last six no witness might similarly is
victory something it is grass or Henry
do is to keep your head down and book I
caught in the plan you try you little
shit you two thumbs up against hundred
master we are now it&#39;s just a key think
about such insulator which hundred
centuries
he is the natural Triple E ladies 99th
century during the 2011 World Cup next
naturally took almost two years what
happened one senator smashing gopai he
was riding on 70 and then the next day
we hit a bomb a doctor watch it&#39;s
covered century score reach 94 he was a
94 87 leaves office for and said whoa
just hit run smooth and then Steve
Stockman 91 point after that when he
finally accomplished the feat of this
hundred century against Bangladesh he
said laughs syndrome from 9200 for the
most difficult entrance I made in my
world carrier rise from school critical
test fitted so just imagine it layer of
his tally to export powered situating
international cricket the last 10 runs
of his last century for the most
difference that is because yeah allow
those failures of not being able to
convert the other Nazis of centuries
become a different that was conquering
so you can allow space for sa you to go
it&#39;ll know it is blowing say here we&#39;ve
got three uses loaded reach please
CD can be of any type you can lose an
election when you propose to a loved one
and he okay with it that&#39;s the thing you
can fail your exam but you need to
believe that to the mind so
he&#39;s proposing go6 didn&#39;t know you&#39;d
ever locket about the three it may look
like everything today but tomorrow this
another day
so people are the successes people
managed to delete failures from their
mind and then leave for the day and take
over the fight tomorrow
the third is adaptability cricket is a
wonderful game in the sense that no
other game is different so much by the
conditions and some of these hospitals
you have which tell me you have our
class credit can be battling with it it
can be part of it it you get how the
wind blowing you can have a clock tower
you can be hot and humid like if you&#39;re
at every port and VD like you said equip
it is expected to adapt to all these
conditions plus another three powers of
the game the longer version the limited
roles at the tqg how does he accomplish
order it is a mindset so he was oversell
spatzle india produce the first World
Cup in 1975 the very first match against
England India arranged in six euros as
132 words oh my girls can battle through
the healthy evenings will constantly for
four cents or third this is a pathetic
performance at the user from foes later
on he had a mind or he couldn&#39;t get over
so he had purchased this alien yes right
this is technician adult he&#39;d managed up
the parish debate mouth of hysteria in
1987
his New Zealand you could essentially
need a cell phones that is how physical
it is even for people at that level like
this I would say that says personal
going over the comfort zone also I will
say the example two friends of mine from
my medical coverage this both with
energy in general medicine both could do
even in their practice in this all
sounds the North Kerala what are them
suddenly that I want to go to England to
a possibly you must like crazy about
your enemies equal in their months we
were able to get a foreign degree he
said no I want to do that he went to
England and he circled initial for five
years because topple struggle money I
was in the job for citizens completion
certificate after five years
divided the foxy join in some places
about going Preseli then he came back
media pretended he was the acknowledged
experts internationally in that field
today not one international conference
roses or he presenting a paper the other
person equally good till cover abuses of
practice well there was three position
in that town 1981 no there are 30 so
from one in three years become one in
thirty inside it&#39;s more go where are the
other person has become former cop
already achieved because the moon of his
comfort zone
he made the necessary sacrifices so when
you follow your passion be prepared to
make the necessary sacrifice
we prefer to move out of her comfort
zone only this what do you really do
that we&#39;ll be able to achieve your
passion next is rhetoric of course now
you&#39;ve seen such as political back do
you see any emotion solid fish you know
planes no flicks the Gita because
there&#39;s no points which I had an
excellent I will record that I cook it
up and up quite early in life I also do
difficult because the jatropha much you
live in a place for variety and the
nachos before the map says the lineup
and some of the players are loosely
unfair they pointed to be and these are
adventure in any other this thing II
inning and sling this is positively but
an ampere is supposed to be volt pattern
for this is arias or at that point of my
anyway is Bahamas preparatory flight for
one of the speakers for mastery Kumar
and I use praying that mind if you don&#39;t
like a silicon vote for my age
unfortunately started it&#39;s not a poem
for my name in the first so definitely I
told it go to each layer with me and my
second over the pap for cash everyone
knows something off I know I said no no
you could hear a pin drop you step
towards me at us I thought yeah are you
playing I kept a very straight face took
one more step closer to me and us under
yeah are you flying I think at the very
straight face eternal mother knows this
is ha ha ha
if not just like you know for theft and
I mean the wonderful elated if I go swap
me objectivity to my couple dip it&#39;s a
physically new optical through the
capitalist idea came and told you is the
hitch so I gathered all the commands
with my voice I told it happens up you
should be going I know that when I say
not of there is no edge he looked at me
I help again and he said focus from that
point onward is stop those insecurities
I do that if you&#39;re calm and composed or
even if retro being now and compose the
other side of the stick well as if
you&#39;re being excitable you should show
that you know the reacting type you lose
your temper you lose your balance you
will lose approach finally if you are
relaxing given the middle of a match
players know how to relax
the success of great players is that
they could relax the hip switch off in
between in between the readings let&#39;s
player form of the hook of a shadow we
get richer through visual techniques but
so many ways in which people lies in
life you learn to relax
the Soviets personally trained in life
now he said about Ronnie it&#39;s a
wonderful there&#39;s yoga to be done you
can read you pay whatever is said do it
for find a hobby so that that use the
sense of happiness that gives you a
sense of achieve you better pitch off on
what or else if your job and focus on
your happy coffee and be a happier in
the better person
this is what I will say my different
view in a fashion I will say you need a
faster you need it fast and you have
this passion attack or something
early fashion can light up your lives
really fashion can make me the fire
inside you only fashion can motivate you
but know that passion trying it said
throw your passion and be first thank
you very much
[Applause]
