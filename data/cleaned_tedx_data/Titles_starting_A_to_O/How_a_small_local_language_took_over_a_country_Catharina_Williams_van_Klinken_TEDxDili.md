timor-leste is a wonderful place if you
love speaking languages and a bit of a
nightmare if you hate learning them for
a country of just over a million people
we have plenty of languages to choose
from
firstly each ethnic group has its own
language there are perhaps 27 of these
although it depends on what you call a
language then we have two official
languages
tattooin delhi and portuguese and on top
of that we have two so-called working
languages Indonesian and English with so
much choice which one do we use when we
meet people we don&#39;t know this morning
when I went to the market and I went to
look at the show over the road I spoke
to in Delhi with the local ladies I can
hear those of you who are tamari saying
of course that&#39;s what we do when we meet
people we don&#39;t know but why would it be
of course I grew up speaking Dutch at
home and English at school the ladies I
was speaking with grew up speaking their
own language or a sewer at home an
Indonesian at school and anyway it&#39;s not
just timorous who speak tattooin in
timor the other day I was in the shop
speaking taped on Delhi with a young man
from Korea to the great interest of the
shop assistants listening in so the
question I want to ask today is why in
timor-leste do we speak taped on Delhi
with people from other language groups
of course it&#39;s an official language but
it&#39;s only been that since 2002 when
timor-leste became independent and it
was a language of intercultural
communication long before that so my
question goes back further in time why
is Ted rondalee a lingua franca why
Titan when we have so many languages to
choose from some with much larger
populations than T 2 and Lily and some
much closer to the capital D Li
for an answer to this we need to look
into chemos past trying to connect the
dots of evidence for it&#39;s in the past
that we find explanations of the present
it&#39;s an amazing story really with
temari&#39;s rulers portuguese rulers
priests and traders
mcalary&#39;s traders and lots of ordinary
people like ourselves whose names have
never been recorded of course you can
never be sure you&#39;ve connected the dots
of evidence correctly but we&#39;ll give it
a go see what you think but first some
background on Tecton those of you who
live in Timor and no doubt aware that
there are two languages called Tecton
the first often called Tecton Tarek is
spoken along the border between East and
West Timor and further east along the
south coast it&#39;s the original in the
view of many of my titrant addict
friends it&#39;s the best
there are various dialects but if we
speak one dialect then we can understand
people from the other dialects fairly
well the second Teton is called Teton
Delhi after the capital these days it&#39;s
spoken all over the country in schools
in churches the media Parliament in the
last referendum in 2015 there were even
31% of the population who said they
spoke it as their main language at home
but historically it wasn&#39;t like that
even just over a generation ago in 1990
only 7% of the population spoke taped on
Delhi at home and almost all of them
were in the capital Delhi the only
official use of Titan Delhi was in
church and for people outside of Delhi
if they smoked a turn at all if they
spoke it at all it was probably as an
informal language of intercultural
communication what we call a lingua
franca so let&#39;s go back to the question
why when there are so many languages do
we speak Tecton Delhi the answer as is
so often the case comes back to who
ruled whom when we as
community speak the language of another
group it&#39;s usually because we&#39;ve been
ruled by them
just take the example of English in
India and the Philippines Spanish in
much of South America and here in
timor-leste Portuguese and Indonesian
each of these languages is the language
of a former ruler Titone as it turns out
is no exception to understand title we
need to understand Tecton Kingdom the
island of Timor has always had a system
of kingship with lots of hereditary
rulers ruling over small fiefdom
amongst these kingdoms there was a
hierarchy with lesser kingdoms paying
tribute to greater ones 500 years ago
which is as far back as we have records
there were three major kingdoms which
ruled almost the whole of Timor Leste
Navi of the island of Timor in the West
there was a kingdom of somebody they
spoke a language called baikonur and it
covered most of the western half of the
island in the east
there was the Kingdom of Lucca and in
the center there was the kingdom of way
Halle these two kingdoms of Lucca and
way Halle were taken tarik speaking what
sort of kingdoms were they it seems they
were quite large according to one
document 500 years ago
the king of Wei Holly had 46 other
kingdoms under him they were reported to
be all three and independent of one
another other documents suggest it
wasn&#39;t quite that ideally there were
frequent rebellions and Wars so that the
number of subject kingdoms varied what
sort of power did they have we really
don&#39;t know but they were involved in the
sandalwood trade they had quite large
armies and other than that perhaps their
rule was more ritual and symbolic rather
than executive whatever the case these
three kingdoms between them covered most
of the island of Timor
how far did the languages of these
kingdoms spread well
according to one document before the
arrival of Europeans the island of Timor
was inhabited by the bailiffs and the
volcanoes the Viking knows clearly other
by Kano speaking people of the western
part of the island the ones governed by
somebody the bailiffs who dominated the
East are almost certainly taken speaking
people after all the kingdom of mohali
is in a district which even today is
called bellow these two the bailiffs and
the vy canis were described as two
provinces and two people is it possible
that the entire island of Timor just 500
years ago had only two people and two
languages of course it isn&#39;t but they&#39;re
surely truth in it
15 years ago when Rob my husband and I
used to visit a village in the far east
of East Timor where very few people
spoke Teton at the time
sometimes we get to a house and we&#39;d see
children scurrying out the back door
looking for the nearest Tetouan speaker
only once the taken speaker&#39;s arrived
would they open the door to us and only
the tattooin speakers would converse
with us
surely when Portuguese traders and
missionaries arrived people would greet
them in the language that they normally
used for greeting foreigners or any
outsiders that was by Kano in the West
and taken in the East so we see that 500
years ago tattooin was already a lingua
franca in tomorrow what happened when
the Portuguese came the Portuguese were
attracted primarily by sandalwood and
the first shipment of sandalwood out of
Timor was in 1515 but it wasn&#39;t until Oh
well over a hundred years later in 1641
that they set up their first permanent
base this was in the foul in the West in
the baikonur speaking territory they set
it up mainly to protect their access to
send a wood against Mikasa these traders
the settlers were so called to Pacis or
black Portuguese mix
tr√©s people of Portuguese and Islander
descent they spoke Portuguese Malay and
a language very similar to baekje no
even after many years in the foul they
didn&#39;t speak teton of course not it was
outside the reach of the tech on
speaking kingdoms if the capital had
stayed in the foul I rather doubt the
Titan would ever have become an official
language of Timor Leste there anyway
back to the tapas they settled in the
foul and they conquered somebody the
supreme ruler of the West and somebody
was baptized as a Catholic the king of
Wei Holly the one in the center heard
about this and he promptly decided to
convert to Islam after all you had to
decide who to trade with the mainly
Protestant Dutch the Catholic Portuguese
all the Muslim Makassar is the two
pastors were very upset at this new
alliance with the mecca studies and they
headed down to a Holly with 90
Musketeers and they burned the place
down and that was the end of where Holly
or was it Timur is not that easily
defeated now and surely weren&#39;t there
neither the power of where holly was
reduced for a long time but eventually
they rose from in the ashes there&#39;s a
story from about 70 years later in 1712
that the king of lucca and the king of
Wei Holly met at the river Babulal on
the border of what&#39;s now Eastern West
Timor and they made a sacred pact the
king of Lucca would govern the eastern
side and the king of Wei Holly would
govern the western side if serious
strike should arise what they called
quranic farah or buffalo is exploding
then these two kings would broker peace
for the first few hundred years of
portuguese presence in timor they mainly
dealt directly with rulers like these -
it was only once they started to rule
more directly that the king of lucca
lost his power at about the same time
the king of Wei Holly lost his power to
the Dutch this was
that much more than a hundred years ago
but by then Titan had become enough of a
lingua franca it was firmly established
and had no longer needed the support of
these two kingdoms in 1769 Portugal
moved his capital from leaf owl - dili
its present location it&#39;s a funny story
really
the tapas might have been called Black
Portuguese and spoken Portuguese but
they didn&#39;t accept any of the officials
that Portugal sent to rule them
eventually a new governor came and he
managed to take control of LaFell but it
didn&#39;t last long he soon found himself
under siege from the top assess and when
he&#39;d run out of food he fled in the
night and sailed eastward and set up his
new base in Delhi which is why Billy is
now the capital Delhi was in Mumbai
speaking territory even today Mumbai is
spoken around the outskirts of the city
not in Mumbai but in Portuguese and
tetran why taken it wasn&#39;t the language
of the former capital afoul it wasn&#39;t
the language of the land on which Delhi
was established and it wasn&#39;t the
language of the colonizers clearly it
had become enough of a lingua franca
that it became the language of this new
multi-ethnic Township so this brings us
to a new phase of the development of
tattooin in the eighteen the mid 1800s
about a hundred and fifty years ago Ted
tone was spoken alongside Portuguese in
the capital and it started to develop
into what is now recognized this tetran
delhi a tetrameric base with simplified
grammar and a lot of Portuguese loans it
was about this time too that Portugal
started to rule more intensively
throughout timor-leste there one of the
surprising side effects of this rule is
that take on spread further one way it
spread
through the church the church was using
tetran as one of its languages of
prayers and of the catechism on this
slide you can see a photo of the first
tetran book that we know of which is a
catechism from 1885 the Jesuits also set
up a college in soy bada in the east
close to the old kingdom of Sun Bay and
graduates from this school became school
teachers all over the colony as well as
serving in public service and this too
helped to spread the influence of
Techtron as one who learned tetran in
where Holly in the center it&#39;s often
struck me that the Tate when we speak in
Delhi is closer to that of Lucca and soy
bada than it is to potato in a way Holly
and I wonder whether that&#39;s the
influence of the college or whether it&#39;s
the influence of the earlier kingdom of
Lucca I don&#39;t know but it wasn&#39;t just
the church that spread Tate on
ironically it was also the colonial
government
I say ironically because the language of
government was clearly portuguese
nevertheless old people have told me
that they learned titan through
attending meetings with colonial
officials i also wonder how much the
coffee industry contributed to the
spread of titan with its planters and
its traders because when portuguese rule
finished in 1975 there were more
Portuguese there more tattooin speakers
in the coffee growing west of the colony
then they were further east so far we&#39;ve
been looking at the evidence of history
but there are other dots of evidence
which point to take on having been
influential far beyond its borders
these dots come in the form of place
names you would think that each ethnic
group would name places using its own
language and to a large extent this is
true but there are also numerous places
in Timor especially the eastern part
which have
tetran place-names even though the
people of that place are from another
language group the most famous of these
is for homophobe young the mountain of
the spirits of the day which is
surrounded by people from various
language groups but not taken this map
shows those soukous local government
areas for which I have located at least
one Tipton place name the darker colors
indicates at least three some of these
place names might be fairly new but some
have been recorded in documents at least
200 years ago so as you can see Tecton
place names are scattered throughout
much of timor-leste albeit very unevenly
with two exceptions there are none in
York we see in the Far West around leaf
owl and there are none in the Far East
it&#39;s not surprising because the
influence of the two titrant etic
speaking kingdoms didn&#39;t reach to those
parts this is also why when timor-leste
became independent in 2002 these two
districts were renowned as having very
few people who could speak tattooin the
story of Tito and le is a reminder that
we live in a world shaped by stories
from the past with players who never
dreamt that their actions then would
influence our choice of language so many
hundreds of years later it&#39;s a reminder
that we too are playing our stories they
will impact the generations to come
