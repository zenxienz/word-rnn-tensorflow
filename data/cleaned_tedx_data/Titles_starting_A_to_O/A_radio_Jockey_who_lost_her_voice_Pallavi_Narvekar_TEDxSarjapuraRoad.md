we are all medicals
just waiting to happen it&#39;s just that we
are not aware of it till the time life
brings us to a point were very good
morning to all of you I fell in love
very early in life I fell in love with
radio the fact that her voice could
mesmerize people that&#39;s the attention
day after day I was at the end for years
together was something that baffled me
and that is exactly what I wanted to do
I wanted to be was a deal person and
that is exactly what I did
that is what exactly I became they do
professional with 23 to 24 years of
doing this you begin with my
professional a few minutes our dear Fame
actually began
pala stopper you see toget a IR mm
announcer with two tension you don&#39;t see
the better even I started in for the
right one so without this MC Lyte I&#39;m
talk with AI RFM with the times of him
and then with the biggest private of him
network of the country they do pt with
the home I&#39;m still the good ed cxeh no I
invest then the air talking I was in my
twenties when I see it most of this
mostly people see struggle in this first
part of their life and then as is go by
they kind of settle down and taste
success but there are other stories with
this success that you see in me and then
the stocks within let&#39;s don&#39;t have a
look at my medical cecilia diagnosed
with myasthenia gravis in 2005 that was
rotten disease 16 recycles changing for
what again they need situations that&#39;s
about so big and small numbers of
isolation eight times and the number of
times of the ventilator I think six or
seven I wouldn&#39;t remember because most
of the time I was the hospital
now I always like to Dymatize things and
tell stories it was afterward I was a
little person but I still think I&#39;m
something living like the vegan person
also sanitize my eyes a little more I
lost my voice was my first surgery the

time at 3:30 was me to move my thymus
gland and one vocal cord or paralyzed
thank God we have to the doctors worth
it
I would never go back out there I will
not that I have your complete attention
one question that will come to mind is
what is my signature Mastana Travis
simply is a deep it is a very thick
autoimmune disorder that basically
affects your muscles so basically the
army would eat you swallow please and
walk talk so 90 was an extent why my
feet suddenly becomes the Spanish accent
as the co sufficient masters get this
monastic for five to ten years I
remember when I was in the I see for the
first time I was all stable without the
open-heart surgery had taken place the
thymus gland had been taken out and I
was all saddled with machines my finger
of jewels and virus and I did not want
you there I wanted to step out I was
thinking how do I get out and suddenly I
saw a bad fight opposite mine a
middle-aged guy was also startled the
way I was but he was having the time and
I said he that is what I want to do I
want to have that about the model
but it is easy but less hinging I was
actively having a cup of tea I graduated
to having oh you know of vegetable juice
vegetable soup sit so teaspoons and the
doctor says it was a nickel that I had
become vapor so fast so it&#39;s really win
the mind decide to teen bring the other
thing it happens
so when people ask me to get a nurse to
this is inform I said insulation this
always lying all around us is like that
but we have the time to just sit back
and take notice that is not so what does
one do with 20 years of autonomy
disorder at least dilapidated it can&#39;t
be all about hospital admissions and I
flew with this until the most and it
isn&#39;t my fault but is something more
than that and so in these 10 years I
also managed to give birth to finance so
am I so in 2005
you know one has to look after one&#39;s
body Nikolas has the status is only they
still have to live I&#39;m the only one who
can look after them
I was unable to please but two seconds
for two seconds was my entire muscle
state not only to yoga and meditation I
was able to increase my lung power to
six seconds and versatile in about two
months time the sick body was mythical
to a lot of strict aging
I mean imagine a person like me who only
dropped in the mall was about walking
and trying to talk them about because of
all the incidents that I had ultimate
for the earlier when I was working extra
hours take it says nothing nothing about
it not exercising working overtime
my duties of the night fish and see
their family however once I decided that
body has to be looked after I did the
result
I&#39;ve had the seventies only thought
window and Crimea and the necessity of
the 21 did neither happen rarely
half-marathon times to evade city a
friend of mine who said this all in the
mind
they keep running and i did with the
taurons resistance the body is this the
minuses but don&#39;t got a date you have to
note implica gives ourselves and other
toys
I wanted to wear my high heels again and
I wanted to make my ticketed I wanted to
do a week like my other little hey at
the kid not healthy have taken I&#39;m sure
I still might
and then once I was gay first mother who
just said that I was I wanted to go back
to my love they did all I wanted to go
back on there and so the exercises began
in a lots of a person&#39;s now had to
undergo voice training lung exercises
and they did it like how once again
through yoga and meditation and exercise
the result I went back on there there
was a huge dude damn thing that happened
over they do talk who lost of words and
was making a comeback I did go back on
there and I want to thank that doctor
who in 2009 said I would never go back
on it had him instead if I wouldn&#39;t have
taken the first and that was anger and
there was excitement to get back on
little years ago while I see ya two
years ago also I was getting my think
bought I was there for the my snacks
Isis crashes near there by the entire
body decides who said nothing
luckily my tongue was working and I
smuggled by for enthusiasm I noticed
that my story was not big there was a
story on isn&#39;t it eleven stories nice in
front of me and all of them love stories
and I started to bring down the first
there was a study of my life on my phone
which I was apt to my husband
horizontality
outside like he did she thought that
right more like hello I&#39;m not young
enough students wah
I accidentally for fun but yes I did
like someone&#39;s told me I don&#39;t agree at
this lot yeah I was again this time for
the tide to lung failure yes please
and I was on distinctly it wasn&#39;t 46th
birthday and my son and my husband
gifted me a comparison of this also is
affected all the ideas of love stories
it was advanced in the eyes of other
hospitals went down in the dumps and
every single stock you can see the end
of the tunnel
I&#39;m the one one still said that in my
kids my girls is gone you did not
witness left in life but you have to
realize that then you penguins think I
mean imagine at the end of Terriers have
some come to be averse to becoming
monitor and now rocket
in the last 20 years
what is what I did but also important is
the fact that think it happened anytime

even at 2:46
mind body sucker country ever single
thing is not the mind
um yes living but the body is not what
sometimes is the other way I brought in
my sizzling - not even what to think
because of ill health
I&#39;m suing it it feels they robbed a
clearly because the nights are just
getting you&#39;ll feel the night you know
so very good thing the next morning or
not even a partner sitting right with
you just waiting for that veil to son so
how does one deal with it one has to
deal is it only by overcoming that fear
making sense it&#39;s fear once I did my
thought of not setting the hospital
all the doctors also devotes all the
best if when I started to think of the
hospital as a place of healing and that
is when these things start to move so
the numbers of hospitals I&#39;ve had I
spent the Christmas Eve alleys I was
happy there many people asking what is
it that makes you tick
of course it is my family my friends and
my support system because this company
spans with acoustic engine and then
their influences in their life right
look who taught me how to eat what we&#39;ve
been doing if I&#39;m standing there today
I think I&#39;m Italian Digital goes to
because of musician how he have seen the
way I eat
it&#39;s immensely if the daughter lost
their Hattersley
then I would not be standing here last
year when I was done for the type to
unseat here the doctor said that they
need to put a hole in my throat so that
I can see once I hope that in the
hospital I said don&#39;t they how does it
limit total is my hovel didn&#39;t hold my
thought I said no they and university I
wanted to get out I&#39;d go home in unity
the doctors told that it was a thematic
turn around and mr. Sultan submitted oh
so yes suppose system family everything
is important but also button is being
stubborn in rights you know please in
right to make sure that you&#39;re healthy
now it&#39;s to stay a little longer little
sense anger family stubbornness is very
very important you cannot this yourself
but other time get rid as I always say
suit
total damage muscle hey na middle name
once you think their mind resides or the
other in the mind makes up his mind
nothing and comes with nothing Apple
only three
[Applause]
