who of you in this room would prefer to
purchase products from brands that help
create a better world so as you can see
today the market which is all of you
guys expects brands to give back and
actually if I put that in numbers it&#39;s
61% of consumers that are actively
looking for products and services that
have created by the world and of course
companies know that already
and that&#39;s why some companies practice
if you broad categories of corporate
social responsibility or in short CSR
and among those categories are things
like environmental efforts or ethical
labor practices or philanthropy which is
donating money to charity or nonprofits
anyone in this room that runs a
nonprofit organization or a charity okay
so organizations just like yours are
depending on these kinds of donations
but why not
rethink the traditional model of how
companies work together with nonprofits
and make it better you know if you look
at brands there&#39;s what brands like and
there is what brands do so what brands
like is what they talk about CSR is
nothing that a brand really likes but
it&#39;s something that a brand needs to do
and I think we can change that we can
change that by going away from a
traditional see is our model towards who
we are model so it&#39;s not about donating
money to charity because you feel like
you have to it&#39;s because you want to but
how do we get there it&#39;s about
developing partnerships between
companies and nonprofits that are based
around the philosophy and DNA of both of
them and I want to give you an example
that example is between a nonprofit
organization that I work with I&#39;m also
the vice president of waves of water
Europe
we provide access to clean drinking
water to communities all around the
world and the partner my example is in
car company so in vehicle manufacturer
so you can see it&#39;s two very different
types of organizations or businesses so
with waves for water we provide access
to clean drinking water to communities
in need all around the world we do that
through the distribution of potable
water filters the digging and renovating
of wells but also building rain
catchment systems where there is no
groundwater available one of the filters
that we are using has the capacity to
clean 3.7 million liters of water which
is enough to supply 100 people for up to
five years and it only costs 50 euros so
think about that a 50 year old filter
can supply enough water to supply 100
people for up to 5 years that is HUGE so
waves to waters philosophy is based
around - what you love and help along
the way which basically means you know
plugging purpose into your passions so
go out and do the things you love go
hiking go mountain bike riding go
sailing go surfing go do whatever makes
you happy
but then plug purpose into that simply
by taking water filters with you and
giving them to people in need while
you&#39;re on your trip the organization was
founded 2009 by this guy his name is
John rollers he is a former professional
surfer so if you look at waves of water
spreads there is a couple of key words
attributes that come into my mind so
it&#39;s about exploring and adventuring and
it&#39;s about living life to the fullest
and of course plugging purpose into your
passions now I want to bring in the
partner in my example which is an
Japanese vehicle company that is also
involved in a motor sport since the 60s
their brand is spilled around going on
your adventure breaking free from the
crowd
and finding your own path so as you can
see there is similarities in the brand
values of both of them so this vehicle
company they approached they were
interested to doing a project with waves
of water they wanted to support what we
do waves of water did something unique
wastewater analyzed their brand and
pitched him a tailor-made project it
speaks to the philosophy and DNA of both
of them and that project was based
around a rally in Brazil that happens
each year and the idea was simple the
idea was to get one of the brand&#39;s rally
cars to actually drive to rally with
them so all the drivers they were
driving against each other but waves for
water and they were driving against each
other and against time but waves for
water was driving against the statistics
of the world water crisis it was in ten
days journey over five thousand
kilometers and waves to water stopped in
villages along the way to provide them
with access to clean drinking water and
the project was a full success John rose
to founder was actually followed by a
camera team for to gaze from Globo which
is Brazilians national broadcaster and
ended up they made in segments that
ended up being in the primetime news all
over Brazil some of the other drivers
they were so inspired that they took
water filters with them the year after
one team even branded their car with
waves of water just to show support so
the company did not only got a great CSR
to who we are project but they also got
lots of press around it and waves for
water they executed you know they got to
drive a truck drive you know ten days
around Brazil and were able to have
thousands of people along the way while
also staying true to our philosophy and
I want to show you now a clip from this
project
my friend googa from Brazil called me
and said we&#39;ve got this huge off-road
rally happening and we should plan a way
for water mission around it
[Music]
it&#39;s all happening at the same time
there&#39;s like one race going on here and
the other race going on here
we&#39;re not racing against them or racing
against time but we&#39;re racing to get
people access to clean water
[Music]
it immediately triggered me and spoke
directly to the model of waves for water
which is go out there and do the things
you love and help along the way
[Music]
I always think it&#39;s not really what we
do it&#39;s how we do it and so in this case
you know we have our mode of transport
logistics off-road truck and we have it
stocked with filters and buckets and
we&#39;re really guerilla style it&#39;s all
really based around the spirit of
adventure going out there and testing
yourself and getting through adversity
[Music]
the reason why most waste water ships
are as adventurous as they are because
oftentimes we&#39;re on the fringe you know
you need to be on horseback or you need
to be in a 4x4 truck otherwise you can&#39;t
get to this place so it makes it really
exciting in terms of the adventure but
it also allows us to access these
pockets these forgotten ones in sense
you know that don&#39;t really get help just
because it&#39;s really hard to get them
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
whether it&#39;s a rally race you know 5,000
kilometers across the desert and any a
number of things can happen or it&#39;s you
know trying to climb a mountain or it&#39;s
surfing some tidal bore way than in the
Amazon it&#39;s a way of life this has been
my way of life since as long as I can
remember
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
but I always believed going out there
and making yourself happy to do anything
that you love first is number one but
now I&#39;ve sort of created a platform to
be able to help people in the process
there&#39;s a purpose to it beyond myself
and that&#39;s that&#39;s where I feel like it
rounds out the full circle
[Applause]
[Music]
so to date waves water has executed over
a hundred five projects ranging from
disaster relief Public Health and brand
partnerships in 32 countries impacting
seven million people so traditionally if
you are run an NGO and the organization
is based around water and all you would
naturally look for partners and branstad
work in the same space and if you have
been company you would do the same vice
versa so waves of water has nothing to
do with cars and the car company has
nothing to do with water but what unites
them is just a way of life it&#39;s their
philosophy and as John said in the video
you know it&#39;s not about what you do it&#39;s
about how you do it
so if you run in nonprofit organizations
then go out and look for partners that
share your philosophy that share your
way of life and approach them with an
idea for a one-time project but also
with an idea for a long-term partnership
you know if you are able to secure a
long-term partner it not only means
instead of way of income for your
organization but it also means that most
likely this partner will start to build
a narrative around your project we start
to create content around it which brings
back to awareness back into your
organization and if you run an
organization then do less CSR and do
more who we are and you will be able to
help create a better world in a very
authentic and meaningful way you will be
able to create content to attract and
engage your existing customers but also
attract new ones and I can tell you one
thing for sure if you&#39;re able to do CSR
to who we are project right and it&#39;s a
long-term commitment then ultimately
your brand can turn from a brand that&#39;s
being liked into a brand that&#39;s being
loved thank you very much
[Applause]
