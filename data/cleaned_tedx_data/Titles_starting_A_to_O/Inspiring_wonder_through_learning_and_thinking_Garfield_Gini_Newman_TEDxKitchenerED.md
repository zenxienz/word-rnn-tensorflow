good evening we had the good fortune
this past summer to travel to Greece to
attend our nephews wedding and of course
while we were there we visited the
Parthenon and the Acropolis and my
sister when we met her at the wedding I
said so what&#39;d you think of the
Acropolis what&#39;d you think of the part
on you there and she said yeah it&#39;s just
a bunch of rocks what do I care and I
thought it&#39;s just a pile of rocks by the
way my backgrounds history this broke my
heart but more importantly it struck me
that somewhere along the way school had
failed her and failed to ignite wonder
ignite a questioning about these things
she said were just rocks because when I
is there I saw a civilization I saw the
birthplace of democracy where where
Socrates you know just down the hill had
been put to death for his views she saw
a pile of rocks and it struck me you
know what do we need to do in schools to
inspire wonder and I want to suggest you
this evening that schools are at a
crossroads in a digital world where kids
carry in their pocket all the
information they could possibly want
schools could no longer be a place where
we we simply pumpkin Toto to kids
because we&#39;re gonna be quickly become
you&#39;re relevant but I&#39;d also suggest if
schools are simply a place where kids
come so they can explore whatever they
want I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s relevance in
that so how do we find the place of
schools and educators in this digital
space and and I want to suggest you it&#39;s
central to what I want to speak tonight
school should be a place where kids
experience things beyond what their
daily experiences are where they are
excited by great literature and great
works of Arts and an ancient
civilizations or ideas and math and
science that but school is a place to to
excite kids and and I want to suggest it
in in this vein that in a digital world
two things need to be happening wonder
needs to be the driver for learning we
need to inspire kids to one
to want to know more about but we also
have to put thinking at the core of
learning in an age of fake news kids
need to be thoughtful about what they&#39;re
learning about and be able to think
deeply about these issues so I have to
pause at this point and say you know
given what I just told you I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s a Turing I think there&#39;s lots of
conversations not just across this
country but internationally on on
putting thinking creativity
collaboration
these are buzz words happening all
around the world so it almost seems
self-evident and yet how are we going to
get there and I want to suggest that we
have some work to do this Gallup poll
this is 2015 so just two years ago found
the longer kids stay in school the less
they want to be there now this is an
American study but in grade 3 76% of
students were excitedly engaged in their
learning and by grade 10 we&#39;re down to
44 percent that the longer kids are in
school the less they want to be there so
we have some work to do to make sure
that schools remain a place of wonder
for kids a place of excitement and I
want a suggestion we have competing
visions in education all I have to do is
pick up a newspaper early September and
you&#39;re going to see the same kind of
stories and they tend to be driven by
this notion of you know do we have a
basics or an inquiry approach and many
school boards been embracing an inquiry
approach and now we&#39;re certainly see
some backlash while kids don&#39;t have
basic numeracy or they&#39;re they&#39;re
missing basic literacy that they&#39;re not
learning the basics and notice what
we&#39;ve done is we set up a false
dichotomy we&#39;ve set up something that is
simply unhelpful in education if we
really want to help schools we need to
stop the pendulum from swinging back and
forth people have been in education for
a while we see the pendulum swing back
and forth
let&#39;s stop swinging the pendulum and
realize there&#39;s you can reconcile Basics
in inquiry there&#39;s no reason I can&#39;t
build numeracy literacy basic
understandings through an engaging
inquiry approach we do not have to
choose one or the other and let me show
you why I think there&#39;s a danger in this
an inquiry approach without some basics
you know free to say to children we&#39;ll
come to school and explore what you want
to discover it&#39;s kind of like having
blinders on because I want to explore
what I think I already know but nobody
opened that my ice of the world beyond
school needs to be a place that takes
the blinders off and opens the world to
kids to explore so in the one hand we
want to open that up on the other hand I
want to suggest you can&#39;t think in a
vacuum you don&#39;t think about nothing
schools have an obligation to make sure
kids are learning the content the
concepts that they need to explore ideas
to solve meaningful problems we need to
invite kids into the space to explore
meaningful authentic problems and build
their understanding to be able to engage
in those problems so what I want to
suggest you instead of a swinging
pendulum how about we find the balance
between building content knowledge and
nurturing the key competencies that kids
need to succeed in an increase in the
complex world so how are we going to get
there I want to offer a few thoughts
tonight on on how we you know move from
this kind of rhetoric that sounds good
but yeah but was it look like and part
of my inspiration has been video games
and the success of video games that wire
video games so successful for those of
you who have played Angry Birds you&#39;re a
part of 200 million hours a year of
people launching birds and green pigs
200 million hours why what is it about
video games and I would suggest three
things there are clear objectives you
know what you&#39;re trying to do you engage
with the problem you don&#39;t have to read
the manual first you don&#39;t have to sit
through tutorials first you launch the
learning by engaging with the game and
you have opportunities to learn through
failure you have an opportunity to say
well that didn&#39;t work hit the reset
button and try it again we need to find
that reset button in education that kids
try it out come on back what you learn
from that let&#39;s try that again so what
does that look like how do we make
classrooms wonder driven starting with
my first point how do we how do we make
that classroom space wonder driven for
kids and I&#39;m going to start by saying me
come up with assessments that actually
psych kids I think far too often
assessments for children are seen to be
that nasty thing we do at the end of a
body of learning I think assessment
should excite kids they should they
should want to engage with them the
images you see here this is the last
field trip I took kids on before I left
my high school classroom I was teaching
an ancient hiss
free class and I told my students the
first week a month from now we&#39;re going
to the beach to build sandcastles your
challenge is to pick the most impressive
sight from an ancient civilization that
you can justify as an important site and
a month from now we&#39;re going to the
beach we got there at 10 o&#39;clock they

had four hours from 10:00 to 2:00 to
build the most impressive reproduction
in sand that they could by the end of
that four hours we had an area double
the size of the stage covered in sand
sculptures we had Epidaurus the Greek
Theatre we had a Roman Baths complex you
can see on the bottom we had the Great
Sphinx at 2 o&#39;clock local newspapers see
TV showed up media was there and I need
you to understand I don&#39;t care if kids
are good sand sculptors that&#39;s not my
curriculum goal what I cared about is
that they could ask good questions that
they could find reliable resources that
they could work together in collaborate
to pull off something truly amazing I
was building the competencies they would
need to work well in my history courses
me for the sand sculpting was to excite
them to get them to care about the
learning they were going to engage in
and we need to make learning relevant we
need to help kids see that what they&#39;re
learning has value has meaning sadly you
know civics for a number of years has
been one of the top failed courses in
the province kids are not connecting
with civics they&#39;re 15 16 years old
they&#39;re not seeing the connection
well what if we got them to think about
you know Elon Musk needs some help
he plans to establish a colony on Mars
and most the conversations I see are
about the science that will allow us to
eventually colonize Mars well how about
the governance what if we made a civics
course about helping Neela on must think
about how you&#39;re going to create the
governing structure for a new colony on
Mars and what if we looked at Canadian
government through the lens of what are
we getting right and what are we getting
wrong if you could advise Elon Musk on
what we should do when we establish this
new colony what can we learn from
Canada&#39;s example connect it to something
that might excite kids give them that
opportunity and I want to suggest that
we make learning what I call real real
so I&#39;ve created this you know there are
two dimensions and always I&#39;ll called it
real real not just real because one
dimension is what&#39;s the product or
performance what do we
having kids do I would argue tests for
kids or fake fake okay that for kids
tests are what school makes you do it&#39;s
not what life has you do it&#39;s what you
do in school but when you get out of
school I have to take those skills and
do something more authentic so so how do
we engage kids in creating performances
or tasks that are authentic in nature
but my second dimension who&#39;s the
audience what&#39;s the purpose of the
audience for that task let me share with
you a quick example grade five teacher
teaching 3d shapes show kids a variety
of chocolate bars and she said what do
you notice about the shape of most
chocolate bars in their packaging and
the kids said well they&#39;re all
rectangular prisms except which one
anyone can think of a chocolate bar that
is not a rectangular prism how many of
you are thinking Toblerone right by the
way part of its brilliant marketing is
it&#39;s triangular shape you see that you
know Toblerone part of their marketing
campaign so then she showed them cereal
boxes she said I want you to imagine
that a new cereal is being launched they
need to get space on crowded shelves we
needed to stand out their challenge was
to design a new cereal box that would
get your cereal to stand out but it had
to meet these three criteria it had to
ship easily it had a stock easily on
shelves and then you had a bill to pour
it easily and so kids engaged with
learning about 3d shapes I&#39;m working
with nets and oh you know learning their
math through a challenge that they saw
as a Fendi can real now I&#39;m going to
tell you if you can remember the the the
grid that I had up there that had fake I
would argue this is a fake real task the
task is real the problem was when the
designs were done they were brought and
they sat in the classroom the teacher
marked them and sent them home I think
of the opportunities have we brought in
some outside guests to look at those to
give feedback or sent them out to a
marketing company that we create a real
audience and a real product the power
for learning when kids are creating
authentic tasks and presenting them to a
real audience and we want to use
provocative launches and I&#39;m using the
term launch to say don&#39;t make the
interesting task the end of
the unit the end of the learning used
the provocation as a way to hook kids
last year is asked to teach a lesson to
grade two students in British Columbia
on the water cycle now I don&#39;t know if
anyone in here&#39;s taught that but that
can be a boring kids label a water cycle
that&#39;s not the most riveting and I had
to think about what am I gonna do to get
kids excited about learning about the
water cycle so here&#39;s the question I
asked them I asked them how likely is it
that we drink the same water the
dinosaurs drank and I can tell you those
grade twos immediately came to life they
were thinking about dinosaurs
drinking water we don&#39;t drink the same
water in fact I gave them a dashboard
and I said where would you be from no
way we don&#39;t drink the same water okay
maybe it&#39;s likely and I can tell you in
the first 10 minutes of my lesson with
the provocation posed the vast majority
of the kids were saying no way we don&#39;t
drink the same water as dinosaurs well
over the next 45 minutes they learned
about precipitation and condensation and
evaporation they started to think about
that and they started thinking about
that as a cycle and within 45 minutes
they change their minds and now they&#39;re
saying well actually maybe we do and the
beauty was we said well that we
introduced a number line to them and
said well so if you&#39;re drinking the same
water as dinosaurs then how likely is it
that your ancestor seven generations ago
we&#39;re drinking the same water that
you&#39;re drinking well that made sense
because I could see it on a number line
so seven generations forward will they
be drinking the same water well yeah and
it launched them into an inquiry on what
we can do to protect our water supply
because they have an obligation for
future generations but notice this
provocation we had them hooked from the
from the very beginning of this lesson
and how do we put thinking at the core
so my first business how do we get
wonder into learning and how do we make
sure that we&#39;re engaging kids in deep
thinking and I&#39;m gonna start by seeing
problematize everything everything I do
in my class should be an invitation to
think everything is a problem to think
about or to engage with and when I say
everything I mean teaching content just
teaching straight-up content is still a
problem to solve let me give you an
example imagine that some of us in the
room are considering a new car and we&#39;re
thinking about the new Tesla Model 3
and you have to decide whom is this the
right car for me here are six facts
about the model 3 Tesla if you get to
keep four of those facts - you have to
cross out which two are least helpful in
helping you make your decision now I can
tell you when I&#39;ve asked this question
with many others the one the first ones
that get crossed off the color I don&#39;t
care what color not that important to me
another common one stroke that people&#39;s
throat and strike off I don&#39;t care that
it goes from zero to 106 seconds I&#39;m not
buying a sports car and buying it for it
right so then I&#39;ll flip it I&#39;ll say well
tell me one that&#39;s really important to
you the range I need to know the car
will get me a far enough distance or the
rebate while I didn&#39;t know about that
rebate by the way I just problematize
note taking one of the most basic things
we do in schools kids is have them take
notes learn content but as soon as I
said the children you only get to keep
four of these facts you have to cross
out - I turned into thinking exercise
that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying to you everything
we do in school can be an invitation to
think we need to problematize learning
so thinking is at the core its routine
and what children do and we need to get
beyond notions of correctness but
correctness matters and you know I often
say to people I don&#39;t really want to
drive across a bridge where the engineer
wasn&#39;t worried about whether they got
their calculations correct and not sure
I want to go to the doctor who&#39;s you
know guessing on my pursuant of my
medication and I&#39;m estimating it&#39;s close
enough
of course correctness matters but as
educators what should matter most is
what we would call provably correct
there&#39;s two different types there&#39;s
obviously correct and there&#39;s provably
correct by the way to a four-year-old
two plus two equals four is provably
correct if I&#39;m four years old if I&#39;m in
grade 9 four times four is sixteen
should be obviously correct our focus
and math classroom should be the
justifications how do you know your
answer sound that we get me on simply
well I plugged it into a formula I think
I have the correct answer can you
justify that answer and we need to help
students build the intellectual toolkit
they need that will help them be
successful and by that
these three pieces building their
background knowledge I said earlier you
know we don&#39;t want the swinging pendulum
we need to build content knowledge
because we need to build students
background so they can make informed
thoughtful decisions at the core of all
critical thinking is applying criteria
to help you make thoughtful decisions
and teaching kids structures organizers
that can help them make sense of
information helps them see patterns help
them make connections help them make
thoughtful decisions and finally I want
to suggest we need an iterative approach
to learning that embraces what I call
productive failure we need to launch
with the problem and let kids
continually loop back and try things
again as they&#39;re learning unfolds as an
example I I was working with a group in
Alberta grade 10 science class they were
doing an energy unit put up this picture
we asked the kids which is these two
sides because your job is going to be to
design the most exciting giant slide you
can and you&#39;re gonna make a pitch to
your local Town Council to try to
convince them to build it which one of
these would go the fastest and I can
tell you the majority of kids thought
the ones on the right the dot slide
would be faster we took out a ball
bearing and we dropped it down a curved
piece of metal and a straight piece of
metal and the curved one beat it by a
longshot and the kids jaws dropped they
said really because every drop is an
energy conversion it&#39;s picking up speed
they&#39;re going oh my god well we invite
kids if you were to draw design your
perfect slide sketch it out now every
day they learned a lesson and in science
they would go back to the original
drawing and they&#39;d say hey I&#39;m on the
right track oh I know a modification I
should make nobody&#39;s instead of the more
traditional we teach all the science and
then we say now that you&#39;ve learned all
your science build a bridge we launched
with the invitation to create a bridge
and every day you learn you will make
revisions refinements you&#39;ll think
differently about that as it unfolds and
let me just finish with this thought
I love these quotes from John Cleese
first of all who said you know if I&#39;m
Monty Python he said one of my
colleagues in Monty Python it was a far
more talented writer than I was
naturally a more gifted writer he said
but I produce better skits and I was
always curious why my skits turned out
better
he said I began to realize that my
colleague he&#39;d come up with an idea and
that&#39;s the idea he&#39;d run with he said
but I wouldn&#39;t I would stick around for
hours reworking my idea thinking it over
reworking the game he said and I love
this quote he said I learned to live
with the problem longer and because I
lived with the problem longer I produce
better skits we need to let our kids
live with problems longer let the muck
about let them Mull it over let them
realize that&#39;s not working you might
need to figure out why let children live
with the problem longer so it goes
deeper and Andrew Stanton of Pixar films
uses this phrase often fail early fail
fast and he says that because he says to
fail late in a film project is the cost
the theater or said the movie company
millions of dollars you do not want to
find out at the end of the product upon
that release your movie stinks because
you just lost millions you want to find
out early that the conception you&#39;re
working with has some flaws so as John
Cleese said you can work it over you can
rethink it you can live with the problem
fail early fail fast so we can use those
productive failures to move forward in
the learning to let kids embrace the
risk-taking and have the chance to fix
so I want to finish this by going back
to these rocks that were just rocks and
say as teachers as educators in a
digital world I think what we need to be
doing is helping kids discover the
Wonder and learning that helps them see
the story within the stones to get
behind the stones and by putting
thinking at the cord nurture the deep
understanding and the genuine
competences they need to succeed in the
increasing complex world they live in
thanks so much for your attention
[Applause]
