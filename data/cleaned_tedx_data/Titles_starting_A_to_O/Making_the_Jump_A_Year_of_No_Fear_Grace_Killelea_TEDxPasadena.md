I declared 2011 my year of no fear when
I realized I was afraid unhappy and too
scared to take risks that January I
celebrated my 52nd birthday in Las Vegas
and decided to skydive while I was there
because if you&#39;re gonna jump you want to
do it someplace flat where you&#39;re not
gonna hit a lot of buildings when I got
to the skydive school I was greeted by a
group of super-fit skydive instructors
who all looked like they played in the X
Games and the first thing they do is
weigh you on an industrial scale there&#39;s
a good time so there I stood in the
center of a group of men being weighed
at the time I was 247 pounds and I was
only 3 pounds under the weight limit I&#39;d
been so worried about the weight limit
I&#39;d call the school twice to confirm it
was 250 and I think I actually said if I
get there and you tell me I can&#39;t jump
somebody&#39;s getting hurt the reason that
mattered to me was I had been 400 pounds
so to get below 250 was a big deal after
they weighed me I realized that I needed
to go through a few more steps now if
you&#39;ve ever seen anybody skydive you
know that when they jump everything
moves right their face jiggles their
body jiggles so before the left before I
left the hotel I&#39;d put on Spanx from my
ankle to my neck
so the first thing they have you do
after the weigh-in is they have you
watch a safety video which I&#39;m going to
tell you now did not make me feel safe
this is what I&#39;ve remembered hearing
your jumping out of a plane by your own
choice and you could die thanks for
coming so the truth is you jump with a
trained experienced instructor who&#39;s
done it thousands of times after the
video my instructor said to me I need
you to show me that you&#39;re physically
capable of the jump and he told me I had
to hold my legs up to my chest for 20
seconds without using my hands it&#39;s like
doing a crunch I couldn&#39;t do it I&#39;d lift
my legs up and my muscles would shake
and my feet would hit the floor and he
said if you can&#39;t do it you can&#39;t jump I
thought my year of no fear had gotten
off to a pretty bad start I was
mortified i sat there alone embarrassed
and dejected when the lead jump
instructor whose name was Leonard came
to me and said if you grab the material
of your pants can you hold your legs up
for 20 seconds so I said I&#39;ll try I
showed him and I could do it Leonard
said all right I&#39;ll take you up and I&#39;m
gonna modify the jump go suit up so I go
back to the locker room I put on the
jumpsuit it is silver I come out I look
like a giant satellite dish
but my personal motto has always been if
you can&#39;t hide it decorate it
so I just rocked the jumpsuit now
remember my Spanx so Leonard goes to put
me into the harness and as he&#39;s putting
me in his hand brushes my stomach and he
said you&#39;re very firm and I said thank
you because the truth is sometimes
you&#39;re held together by Spanx or tape or
glue and it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business but your
own so the plane takes off my turn to
exit Leonard says to me to get on the
floor of the plane and dangle my legs
out of the door and he reminds me of the
exit instructions and the truth is you
don&#39;t really jump out of a plane when
it&#39;s tandem they really just push you so
out we go and it&#39;s so loud you have the
wind rushing at you hear the plane
leaving and the earth is rushing toward
you and you can&#39;t even hear yourself
faith
then Leonard pulls the chute we jerk
straight up I get the world&#39;s biggest
wedgie right from the harness and then
we started to float and it was the most
incredible quiet I&#39;ve ever experienced
suddenly I was washed over with
gratitude and joy and I thought I&#39;ve
done it I&#39;ve started my year of no fear
and I started shouting and Leonard had a
camera on his hand in his videotaping
and I&#39;m going year of no fear and I&#39;m
ball in my outside I&#39;m thanking
everybody who&#39;d ever said hello to me it
was like it was my version of an Academy
Award speech I&#39;m crying Gregory and I
kept yelling year of no fear and I kept
doing this and as we were floating down
I started to see the people who had left
the plane before me begin to land and I
watched them as they were lifting their
legs up to their chest right and they
were running with their instructors it
was like a Beyonce video the shoots
billowing behind them and they&#39;re doing
this
it was so beautiful and then it dawned
on me I hadn&#39;t asked Leonard what it
meant to modify the jump and suddenly I
hear grab your pants so I grab the pants
of my jumpsuit I lift them up I hold
them and then I thought I&#39;m gonna have
the Beyonce win machine landing em eyes
I&#39;m gonna land on my ass and that&#39;s
exactly what happened we hit the ground
we booty bounced a couple times I
scraped across the gravel and landed in
a cloud of dust and as the dust swirled
around me this is what I thought you did
it you jumped out of an airplane
it wasn&#39;t the Beyonce video but I had
done it I had done it I declared 2011 is
my year of no fear because I was afraid
I would always feel afraid and I was
afraid I&#39;d regret my life and research
shows I&#39;m not the only one
Business Wire conducted have printed
some research by Alliance insurance it
said 38 percent of adults regret not
taking risks in their careers 35 percent
adult of adults regret not being gutsier
in their life
Victoria med vaq of a Kellogg School did
some research that said as time passes
we regret what we don&#39;t do not what we
do
so what would it jump look like for you
it might be raising your hand for a
promotion speaking up when you&#39;re
terrified leaving a bad relationship it
doesn&#39;t matter what it is and it doesn&#39;t
have to be big and bold like jumping out
of a plane what matters is you identify
it and you find out what&#39;s keeping you
from doing it in the middle of 2011 I
decided to leave my 30-year career to
start my own business at the time I was
a senior vice president of a fortune 50
company I had a big job in a big company
and I Bri I made great money and I
wasn&#39;t happy I wasn&#39;t spending the
majority of my time doing work that I
loved and making the impact I wanted to
make and here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s really
easy to say you&#39;re not happy quit your
job I think that&#39;s terrible advice
in my year of no fair I did my homework
I looked at my money and I calculated
the risk I certainly didn&#39;t jump out of
a plane without a parachute and I wasn&#39;t
going to leave my job without some
consideration and planning but the
problem was for most of us is we do the
planning but we never take the risk we
never leave the plane and we never make
the jump as 2011 Oh was riding to a
close I announced my departure to my
boss into my team they were surprised
but happy for me and I started my
business in 2012 my business has grown
I&#39;ve fallen on my ass a couple of times
but I&#39;ve gotten back up because my
superpower is I&#39;m afraid everyday and I
jump anyway so now I&#39;m celebrating five
years in much of my business and jumping
as 2011 was winding to a close
I got dared to do something that
terrified me my friend Susan asked me
why I wasn&#39;t dating I&#39;d had a disastrous
short-lived first marriage my practice
husband but dating marriage and men were
no longer part of my life plan and she
said isn&#39;t this your year of no fear
aren&#39;t you supposed to do everything
that scares you don&#39;t you hate when a
friend dares you to do something and
she&#39;s right
dating for me was scarier than jumping
out of a plane and more terrifying than
leaving my job to start my own business
it physically made me afraid but in the
spirit of here of no fear I took the
dare and without telling anybody I
posted a profile on one of those online
dating sites because I&#39;m over 50 and
plus-size I was pretty sure I wouldn&#39;t
hear from anyone but the day my profile
posted I got a note that said someone
had liked my profile I was like I don&#39;t
even know what this means
but I was so delighted so I wrote that
person a thank-you note
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah so on the other side of that note
was a guy who didn&#39;t know that when he
liked a profile it sent somebody a note
that said you&#39;ve liked this person&#39;s
profile he was mortified but he was also
really polite and he responded to my
thank-you note when I looked at his
profile I thought he&#39;s clearly bright
and he knows how to write but it was
hard to tell what he looked like
and his second picture was of his cat
and I thought oh a cat guy but we kept
corresponding and by about the eighth
note he asked if he could call me the
night we chatted we had a lovely
conversation back and forth and about an
hour in he said grace I have something
to tell you you&#39;re gonna find it really
charming or really creepy I hope you
find it charming and I braced myself all
right here he comes he&#39;s a serial killer
he lives with his mother he&#39;s married he
wants to wear my clothes I don&#39;t know
and he said and I&#39;m waiting and he said
I collect action figures
dolls I asked no twelve-inch GI Joe
action figures and I have 400 of them do
they talk to you no do you talk to them
no do they sleep with you
no and I thought I can live with this we
had our first date two days later he was
charming smart and funny and he made me
laugh in the first three minutes and his
name is Leonard it&#39;s not the same
Leonard but clearly a really good name
for me
if you&#39;ve seen Big Bang Theory if
Leonard and Sheldon had a baby that&#39;s
who I married on April Fool&#39;s Day 2014
[Applause]
[Music]
pretty good huh
cute as hell so what would I&#39;ll jump
look like for you what would it look
like is it going back to school is it
doing something that terrifies you like
trying to date again is it asking for
something that you want or leaving
something that doesn&#39;t serve you it
doesn&#39;t matter what matters is you
decide the life you want to have for
yourself it matters that you take action
Jumping requires that you do something
don&#39;t live a life afraid and unanswered
because you haven&#39;t jumped in order to
rise you will have to jump here&#39;s what I
learned in my year of no fear it&#39;s okay
to be afraid
here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned I learned that
it&#39;s okay to be afraid
jump anyway I&#39;ve learned that sometimes
you&#39;re gonna be held together by Spanx
or tape or glue and that should be your
little secret I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s
okay to modify the jump I&#39;ve learned
that it&#39;s okay to land on your ass
because it&#39;s not always the landing that
matters and I&#39;ve learned that you only
regret the jumps that you don&#39;t make so
remember good things come to those who
jump and I double dog dare you to start
your own year of no fear
[Applause]
