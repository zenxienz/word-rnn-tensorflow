welcome to twenty-first century a time
where you&#39;re free to express your
thoughts and opinions on an online
platform and allow millions of users all
around the world to read listen watch
and comment on your opinion of things or
you could also publish a book there are
multiple publishers who publish your
ideas as long as they think it is worth
the investment some of the best-selling
books in the world include Harry Potter
a sale of Two Cities and Chairman Mao&#39;s
poems because they are read by so many
people books are often misunderstood and
the messages are taken out of context to
try and support a writer&#39;s point
countless times films reality shows and
many other forms of media are sometimes
twisted and the messages are warped and
distorted into each individual&#39;s
perception of truth there will always be
people who take one little part of
information or opinion out of the whole
message and emphasize it to prove to
others that their actions are justified
or their opinions are facts I believe
that they do not do this simply because
have cruel intentions but it is more
convenient or it agrees with their
belief and point in humor circumstances
it provides entertainment it is worth
mentioning that elements motifs and
themes are also taken out of context
when something is taken out of context
it is stripped of any story surrounding
the text the meaning then changes and an
interpretation of the text independently
will usually be incorrect
this lack of truth causes
misunderstanding of a message coming
from a speaker or author it is important
to have context when studying something
because if we don&#39;t have context it&#39;s
very easy to make something say what we
want it too rather than what it was
intended to say
however this does not always mean that
what has been taken out of context will
be used for negative purposes sometimes
they are used for human purposes no one
can forget the Bible when talking about
the best-selling books in the world
because well it is the best-selling book
in the world 3.9 billion copies over the
last 50 years to be exact
many readers means many interpretations
since none of us were actually alive at
the time the book was written we have no
way of asking the authors what they
actually mean I&#39;m sure that most of you
have heard about the phrase an eye for
an eye a tooth for a tooth would you
believe me that this thing mostly used
when talking about revenge comes from
Matthew chapter 5 verse 38 now what you
also believe me that the next verse
talks about turning the other cheek but
I tell you do not resist an evil person
if anyone slaps you on the right cheek
turn to them the other cheek also as a
whole this Bible verse is meant to teach
people about not reacting violently but
we&#39;ve all been at that point where
someone does something that just makes
your blood boil and quoting verse 38
makes us feel that little bit better a
more modern book or book series is Harry
Potter now rather than having a scene or
quotation we use out of context
Christians sometimes bash Harry Potter
for presenting witchcraft in a
potentially positive light however the
series is not intended to hurt
Witchcraft and Wizardry
but it is about friendship relationships
loyalty bravery and coming of age
nevertheless all of these ideas are
written in a school that teaches
children to become witches and wizards
and that becomes an easy point for
picking apart let&#39;s move on to another
type of media that never has and
probably never will go out of style
reality television series
speeches and books are not the only type
of media to be used out of context
television shows also have a part in the
story for example the face a modeling
Stock Show the face is about three
mentors who compete to have one girl on
their team become the face of brands
such as Maybelline New York the face was
originally from the UK but has made its
way to America Vietnam and Thailand in a
Q&amp;A or a question-and-answer session
both the ventures and competitors
insisted that the show was not scripted
and that the conversations and
situations that take place are not as
intense as they seem one of the mentors
from the second season in Thailand
clarified the situation in an interview
when she said that conversations that
seemed very heated weren&#39;t from a spur
of the moment
in fact the mentors had started talking
before the cameras were rolling but the
crew only used the moment where the
intensity had reached its peak to make
the show more interesting therefore the
purpose of something said on a show
might not always be what the speaker
intended it to be the show might have
aired the edited truth in order to gain
a higher rating nonetheless the die-hard
fans of the shows have been taking
well-known or humans phrases from the
shows and turning them into memes not
long ago memes started emerging on two
screens they are the epitome of out of
context especially though memes
screenshots of scenes from famous films
can return into viral memes with one or
two simple sentences a meme works best
with a well known scene that viewers can
recognize quickly accompanied with a
picture can be quotes from the film
itself or whatever the creators
imagination conjures up dispenses humor
out of the screen because its purposes
for entertainment memes are shared so
easily possibly too easily it is so easy
to believe a quote on a meme without
going and doing some research first then
if the mean provokes an emotion or makes
you recall a memory of an event you go
ahead and share with your friends
now I&#39;m not saying sharing is bad but is
the media being shared going to be
understood in the intended context or
will it cause someone who will take the
information at face value to
misunderstand something moving on
everyone knows that election time can
get quite stressful for both citizens
and politicians for example the 2012
elections Mitt Romney and Barack Obama
both ran for president however even
after Obama won the elections the media
did not stop attacking both candidates
particularly online if you type this
sentence into a search engine your
screen will be filled with headlines of
articles and video titles concerning
Obama&#39;s stump speech in Roanoke in the
state of Virginia on July 13th 2012
according to multiple news articles and
YouTube channels that support Mitt
Romney Obama is being insulting to small
businesses this was not exactly the
ideal situation a presidential candidate
would like to be in however the context
surrounding this phrase changes its
meaning what Obama meant when he said
you didn&#39;t built that was even if our
businesses are successful we aren&#39;t the
only ones who worked on him he even said
that he was struck by people who believe
that credit to their successes would do
to themselves this is what he actually
said if you were successful somebody
along the line gave you some help
there was a great teacher somewhere in
your life somebody helped to create this
unbelievable American system that we
have that allowed you to thrive somebody
invested in roads and bridges if you&#39;ve
got a business you didn&#39;t build that
somebody else made that happen the point
is is that when we succeed we succeed
because of our individual initiative but
also because we do things together taken
out of context one could view Obama as a
politician who takes advantage of others
but when the whole speech is heard the
politician could be viewed as an
open-minded and grateful person
claims were also made against Obama&#39;s
opponent Mitt Romney in an interview
with journalists Soledad O&#39;Brien on the
1st of February 2012 Romney said I&#39;m not
concerned about the very poor O&#39;Brien
questioned Romney with that&#39;s there are
lots of very poor Americans who are
struggling who would say that sounds odd
to H Romney&#39;s response was finished the
sentence what Romney actually said was
I&#39;m not concerned about the very poor we
have a safety net there if it needs
repair I&#39;ll fix it in 2012 15 % of
Americans were living below the poverty
line
the former phrase out of context might
have been enough to relieve Romney of 15
percent of his possible votes on the
other hand finishing the sentence the
rest of this phrase supports Romney&#39;s
next claim his focus is directed at
struggling middle-income citizens who
don&#39;t have a lot of support we can&#39;t
exactly blame newspaper articles
magazine headlines or online journalists
for using that part of the quote as a
click bait for reeling in customers and
clickers if a presidential candidate
openly expressed that they don&#39;t care or
aren&#39;t concerned about the poor most
people would feel it fit to spend their
time reading about the incident thus
resulting in an increase in purchases
and views the image used in this
anti-immigrant poster is not what it
seems at first glance it looks like
something that has been taken from the
borders of Great Britain and it seems to
match with a message in reality the
image was taken at the Croatia Slovenia
border but not all political memes are
bad that is for everyone except the
politician it is about the most popular
satirical memes are usually simple
sentences coupled with pictures taken in
unfortunate moments or simple pictures
and the darkest sentence a person can
create all four types of information
newspapers television the internet and
memes are not always what they seem the
content shown in print on
even online are often small parts of a
larger truth why because we cannot
escape the fact that even though honesty
is the best policy and the media is
encouraged to be honest and truthful the
truth isn&#39;t always interesting enough
for people to reach for that morning&#39;s
edition of newspaper or to click on that
really controversial headline in
conclusion think for yourself think
critically when you receive a piece of
information online don&#39;t be so quick to
judge who or what the information is
about rather than taking the information
at face value go ahead and do some
research of your own so you can
understand and see if the information
presented to you is legitimate and
fairly presented with the right context
after all a whole world worth of
information is available at your
fingertips
thank you
