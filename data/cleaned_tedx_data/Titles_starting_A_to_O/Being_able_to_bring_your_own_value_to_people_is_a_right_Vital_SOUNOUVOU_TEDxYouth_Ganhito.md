Brazilians being told no no being told
no every time every time you went to
sell something which you actually knew
was good
something you you&#39;ll be working on for
so long something you spent so much time
making sure is good being told no it&#39;s
not just my story
he&#39;s a story of every single an
entrepreneur in Africa it&#39;s a story of
thousands and thousands of young people
who were told go back to the farm
go back and create value but where in
the world are you gonna sell your value
when nobody&#39;s gonna buy it where in the
world are you gonna sell your crop when
when you produce it you don&#39;t even have
the market to actually place that so
that the buyers can see it and be able
to actually benefit from it how in the
world can you make an impact where
there&#39;s no road to the consumer
ladies and gentlemen in 2010 I had the
privilege of being one of the fools one
of the crazy ones who are crazy enough
to believe that we could change our
country that we could actually help
young innovators get an access to market
we&#39;re crazy now to think that just by
organizing an event and bringing
innovators producers and buyers together
who would be able to help them create a
bridge I was young and I realized that I
was wrong
it wasn&#39;t that easy for the past eight
years I spent my every day and night
understanding how wrong I was the
problem is even deeper you see from one
side you have young people and even less
younger who keep producing goods and
wanna have the rest of the world know
about it
and even this city there is no bridge
but on the other side you have those who
can buy those who can actually change
their life with a simple order who have
the funds who are the revenues but who
do not know that those products that
that value actually exist at the step of
their door
I remember that lady that day during the
International Cross for innovation who
who told me my son
I am tired I can&#39;t cope anymore I&#39;ve
spent every day producing have kids how
to pay for their food their college can
you help me can you help me meet buyers
the simple question
a simple but so deep question which made
me work which me when made me
we gave me sleepless nights ever since
she told me those words MIT made me ask
myself how can I help all those people
who actually just want an opportunity to
have access to the market then I started
traveling the world I want across the
world it&#39;s been nearly 30 35 countries
now what I wanted to try to understand
the way trade was dawning everywhere in
the world because I knew that everywhere
in the world went somehow you you have a
good product you can actually be able to
market it how was this was it done all
over the world I had a chance to learn
it and Dubai in Moscow and I also went
all over Africa trying to understand the
way it was done if we was an issue which
was only a Beninese issue or an african
issue
he was stuff I went to the highest the
harshest conditions I want to share this
video with you please watch with me how
harsh this was
No
well the video is not with us so we&#39;re
gonna continue that was actually
beautiful the beautiful islands of the
Seychelles it was actually a joke it was
not that hard I spent amazing days
meeting incredible people across Africa
who had innovations who were just
looking for a chance to be able to let
the world know about their products who
are looking for a chance to have a buyer
from their city from their country from
their continent we started thinking to
ourselves how can we make that possible
being an IT grad with myself as I&#39;ve
embarked myself in the big adventure of
building a trade platform which would
allow every single producer to have an
online shop for free because I believed
that they were being able to bring your
value to people is a right so we started
fighting for the right for e-commerce is
being 8 years and we got to a point
where we build a platform where we ask
ourself ok now how do we make people be
able to pay how can they pay we realize
that our countries were blacklisted from
most online payment system in the world
Benin Nigeria Togo
you name it you were here you know it
and we started thinking how can we make
that possible and thankfully I had a
chance to make an incredible incredible
man mr. Tony aluminum that African who
believed in Africa investing in Africa
and we together thing to help his help
and his partners were able to build a
payment system and today we were able to
put together the first ever trade
platform the an African platform which
allows online payment and now we&#39;re
going across Africa trying to make sure
that every single young entrepreneur in
Africa gets an online shop for free our
vision is that ecommerce becomes a right
for every single African from the
father&#39;s village of Benning
to be able to sell to any buyer in the
world I believe that the development of
Africa doesn&#39;t have to pass through the
same roads as it was done everywhere in
the world we don&#39;t have to build big
hypermarkets we don&#39;t have to build all
the big infrastructure we don&#39;t even
have time for it our life depends on it
ladies and gentlemen I believe in the
right for e-commerce thank you
