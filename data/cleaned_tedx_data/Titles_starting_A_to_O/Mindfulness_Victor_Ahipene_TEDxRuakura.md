I invite you all to close your eyes fill
your body in the chair in the weight of
your body in the chair and on the floor
take a few deep breaths and as you do
that feel the oxygen into your body and
enliven it and as you breathe out feel
your body relax deeper notice your feet
on the floor and the sensations of your
feet on the floor feel the back of your
legs on the chair pressure pulsing
heaviness lightness notice your back
against the chair and as you do that
bring your attention to your stomach
does it feel tight or tense as you
breathe out let it relax further now
bring your attention up into your
shoulders and arms if they feel title
tense spit them soften and as you do
that draw your attention down into your
hands so clint&#39;s is a fist or they feel
tight let them soften out and finally
bring your attention now up into your
neck throat and face muscles as you
breathe out let them soften and take one
more breath and as you do that notice
your body present here in the moment and
as you breathe out I invite you all to
open your eyes see if I&#39;m back with us
great I want you to cast your mind back
to when you&#39;re a child from a young age
we&#39;re all taught about how the body
worked and how to get the best out of it
but there was this area of disconnect
and that was our brain was learning all
this other information as well from the
outside world from our teachers parents
and our family and friends and this is
where the disconnect happens you see we
were taught we were learning all these
things with our brain but our brain was
never delivered
kort how to get the best out of our
brain but it&#39;s not too late for all of
this to change I&#39;m not just talking
about for the youth but for each and
every one of us to truly understand this
you need to meet Matt now Matt&#39;s a 13
year old and since the age of six he was
diagnosed with ADHD in part of his
treatment was medication initially this
worked really really well it helped it
helped with a lot of underlying symptoms
but over time Matt&#39;s parents got more
and more concerned that the medication
was having less and less of an effect
this all came to a head when Matt
started high school and he was finding
that natural transition to high school
with all the new challenges just a bit
too much she was spending more time and
attention then he was out in the
playground and then in the last week of
his first term something happened that
would change Matt&#39;s life forever Matt
got into a heated argument with his
teacher and the next thing he knew he
sprinted out of class and he climbs and
nearby pine tree now when Matt&#39;s parents
oh sorry when Matt&#39;s teacher and
principal came out to get him down they
were greeted with this arsenal of pine
cones flying at the head as you can
imagine a bunch of thirteen-year-old
boys looking outside the class found
this absolutely hilarious
unfortunately Mets principal didn&#39;t have
the same sense of humor and the next
thing you knew Matt was sitting in the
principal&#39;s office with his parents
finding out that he was on a fast track
to getting expelled if something didn&#39;t
drastically change so Matt&#39;s parents
went out there started searching high
and low for what might be a solution
trusted family friend put them on to a
behavioral psychologist after the first
session Matt&#39;s parents came into the
room and though its hold we have a plan
in place obviously excited but also
curious Matt&#39;s mum said so what is it is
that a new medication or is that a
change to his current dosage the
psychologist turned and paused and just
said we&#39;re not going with medication
we&#39;re going with meditation
as you can imagine as a parent they
weren&#39;t overly buying into this
particularly when they found out that
they had to join in and be part of this
as well but they were on The Last Chance
Saloon it was either go with this plan
or face met potentially getting expelled
in the future and then Matt&#39;s mum got
that phone call that in this situation
every parent would read her phone rang
she saw it it was met school she picked
it up it was Matt&#39;s principal her heart
sank it was until Matt&#39;s principal
started explaining that she just got he
just got the reports back from all of
Matt&#39;s teachers and not only had he not
been in trouble but his grades had
improved from failing most of his
classes to passing with flying colors
obviously met teachers and principal
were ecstatic about this and naturally
so was his mum because she&#39;d been
noticing the same changes at home he&#39;d
been police argumentative more helpful
and just a generally more pleasant
teenager if there&#39;s such a thing when I
heard the story from Matt&#39;s mum it
really piqued my interest not because
I&#39;ve got this underlying urge to grab a
pine cone and throw it passes by but
because I&#39;d heard of similar changes and
focus thought patterns attention in
cognition happening in a completely
different group of people and these
group of people worse highly successful
young entrepreneurs you see I&#39;m then in
the unique position as the host of our
internationally acclaimed young
foreigners podcast that I get to sit
down and talk to the world&#39;s most
inspiring and successful young
entrepreneurs part of the show is they
seek ting for the listeners what makes
what sets them apart what makes them
tick but one of the things we really
dive into is two habits what habits give
them an unfair advantage over the rest
of us there were many constants there
were things like the ability to think
creatively their ability to deal with
stressful environments and also the
ability to overcome their fears to take
on bigger risk but there was one thing
one thing in particular there they all
spoke about that not only helped amplify
but also hone in all of those previous
skills and it was exact same thing that
was given to men and the exact same
thing that you&#39;re just experienced the
power of mindfulness in the cool thing
about it is it&#39;s a mental state we can
all achieve we do it by simply focusing
our awareness on the present moment
focusing on the now at the same time we
accept and we acknowledge all of our
thoughts feelings and sensations imagine
that a treatment backed up by rigorous
research one that the pharmaceutical
companies can&#39;t get their hands on and
one that truly positively benefits the
masses now I&#39;m not here to start telling
people to stop taking their medication
but it&#39;s a trained physiotherapist I
read a lot of medical journals so
naturally this is of interest to me
particularly when I have a vested
interest you see I&#39;ve got that nice in
Holmes John a and she&#39;s 13 and is it
uncle I naturally worry for her I worry
about what would be the options given to
her if she presented with similar things
to men she&#39;d be likely given a drug like
adderall which is aimed to increase
activity in the central nervous system
basically we can on your brain and your
nerves in the areas that work on
hyperactivity and focus so seems pretty
good it works on those underlying
symptoms that is until you look at some
of the potential side effects things
like stomach pain nausea vomiting
headaches vision problems in anxiety not
to mention that it&#39;s also part of the
methamphetamine family so it also comes
along with those potential risks that we
often associate with recreational drug
users like addiction and medicated
tolerance abuse so some pretty powerful
pros was some pretty concerning cons so
how does mindfulness stack up
researchers have deep dived into the
brain and had a look at what happens
when people just practice mindfulness
once a day
they saw a marked decrease in the areas
of the brain that are responsible for
controlling strong emotions things like
fear and anger basically the area in the
brain that stops you picking up that
pinecone and throwing it at somebody but
at the same time it markedly increased
the area&#39;s responsible for cognition
memory social skills and focus but the
cool thing about all of this is it
doesn&#39;t just have this effect on
aspiring young entrepreneurs or those
diagnosed with behavioral or attention
disorders it has this effect on each and
every single one of us and that&#39;s why
I&#39;m excited to introduce to you a
process that within one minute will
teach you the skills to go home and
start training your own brain but the
simplicity of it all will allow you to
help those closest to you to achieve the
same things and you don&#39;t have to give
up work and become a monk and start
meditating for 18 hours a day to tap
into the benefits this can happen in as
little as five minutes a day it almost
sounds a bit like an AB blaster plus but
but the results are all there so I ask
you to be present with me in the next
minute well we take those first steps
towards mastery I like in mindfulness to
a board game that I used to play it was
called or fellow and one of the slogans
were it&#39;s a minute to learn in a
lifetime to master and what you&#39;ll find
with mindfulness is is very very simple
to pick up however over time and the
different challenges you will feel
different changes and you&#39;ll take that
step towards mastery when you go off
home you&#39;ll begin by focusing on your
breathing mindfulness is about focusing
on one thing in particular in this case
it is your breathing so you&#39;d focus on
your in-breath breathing in through your
nose and focusing on it coming down your
windpipe enter your lungs in expanding
and then doing the same as you breathe
out for some of you this breath may take
three seconds for others 10 seconds or
more there&#39;s no right
or wrong after your first couple of
breaths it may help to close your eyes
to limit the distraction around you at
the same time it&#39;s important to
recognize your body in the chair and the
noises and sounds around you your
thoughts may drift off from time to time
that&#39;s completely normal
it&#39;s actually one of the powerful things
of mindfulness it&#39;s about being present
in this moment so when you can realize
that your mind and your thoughts have
drifted and then you can attach onto
that and bring your focus back into your
breathing you are doing it right that&#39;s
all it is it&#39;s that simple
focusing on one thing in this case your
breathing but imagine for a second your
child grandchild niece or nephew they
went off to school each day and they
began with five minutes of mindfulness
practice equipping the likes have met
with the skills from a young age to
better deal with the behavior focus in
learning empowering my niece jaane who&#39;s
growing up into an environment with more
change than we&#39;ve ever seen before
more stress and more uncertainty and
helping teach your children to get
better use out of their own brain this
is how I envision a bit of future where
mindfulness is practice every day not
only in the home but also in every
school to learn it ourselves as simple
to introduce it into schools and homes
is simple to implement it daily for not
only ourselves but those closest to us
to improve our cognition our memory our
focus and our attention is simple the
results however a life-changing so I
challenge you the next time you feel
like picking up that pine cone and
throwing it at your boss your co-workers
your friends or most likely your family
take these skills that you&#39;ve just
learned step aside for five minutes
and practice and then introduce it to
those people and truly spread the word
so that we can all start living life
truly in the moment
you
[Applause]
