so where do you go for facts I&#39;ve been
asking this question for years and
obsessed with it and actually it started
when I was a teenager my dad had this
really interesting policy we couldn&#39;t
eat dinner unless we came to the table
with a fact okay that was challenging
right so I had an encyclopedia I knew
how to do this I came to the table and I
had a fact the capital of Bolivia is La
Paz that worked well after a few days my
dad was like you know what Danny I&#39;m
seeing a pattern here I know all of the
capitals of South American countries be
creative do something unique all right I
got this covered so the next night I
came back and I got this one
Miles Davis is the greatest trumpet
player that ever lived I was so proud of
that and my dad had this funny look on
his face and he went Danny that is not a
fact that&#39;s an opinion you&#39;re getting
facts and opinions confused it would be
dad it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s on the album
he&#39;s like no dinner for you and you know
like most 15 year olds I was quite
mature I thought and I I dealt with this
in a mature way I said I hate you and I
went to my room okay well many many
years later it looks like dad was right
and his inspiration made me go into
becoming a college professor and
teaching about facts doing research on
critical thinking and we do have a
problem we&#39;re getting facts and opinions
confused so let&#39;s start with some
clarity what is the fact a fact is a
statement of information that is
empirical which means observable
objective and measurable this shirt is
blue that is a fact not to be confused
with an opinion
which is none of those this shirt is
awesome the shirt is amazing you can&#39;t
do that here and then the worst
possibility the fake facts
misinformation this shirt gives me super
powers out no it doesn&#39;t so what are we
gonna do and how are we gonna get some
clarity about facts well I decided to do
some research looking at how people
think about facts and what they do and
how can they discriminate between what&#39;s
a fact what&#39;s not a fact and we gave our
subjects questions and actually
statements that and we asked them to
analyze them I&#39;m going to give you an
example of what we did with our subjects
I&#39;m gonna give you two statements one of
the statements is true and one of the
statements is not true okay raise your
hand if you think this is true all bats
are blind come on some of you got
originally come on play with me here
even if you don&#39;t believe it alright the
next one we only use 10% of our brain
yeah there&#39;s some hands I see some hands
you don&#39;t see them but yeah that&#39;s
plenty of hands out there well alright I
lied
both of these facts were not true but
you know and not knowing that it&#39;s not
going to change your life but what was
interesting is how you began to think
about this and where you stored this and
where this all comes from so what we did
with our subjects we had subjects and we
gave them 10 statements and we told them
5 of the statements we told them were
true and 5 of the statements were not
true and just like ye we lied none of
the statements were true we also asked
them to rate their confidence how
confident they were in their facts now
the other thing we did with our subjects
we divided them into groups of five or
an individual and that seemed to be
interesting because number one the
group&#39;s the subjects in the groups of
five tended to be a lot more confident
in their fact than the individuals and
the other thing that happened was when
we told them that none of the facts were
true the subjects in the
were like you know I knew that was I
knew that wasn&#39;t true I really did but
everybody in my group was so confident I
just decided yeah that&#39;s probably what
it was what was happening here is a type
of something we call in psychology
confirmation bias confirmation bias
happens when you have a belief and you
look for support and information that
supports your belief for example if you
think vitamin C can cure your cold well
you&#39;re gonna look for information that
supports that belief and our subjects
fell into that category what was
happening here with our subjects it was
more important for them to agree with
the other subjects than it was for the
validity or the objectivity or the
measure ability of the fact agreement
was driving their decision social value
was driving their decision and now
there&#39;s a whole bunch of emerging
research that seems to say in
neuroscience that our brain is involved
in this when we agree our brain releases
a neurotransmitter called dopamine you
may have heard of dopamine you&#39;re gonna
dopamine squirt whenever somebody gives
you a hug you get a dopamine squirt when
your team wins and you get a dopamine
squirt when you agree with somebody so
now what is driving our understanding of
facts are the social value of agreement
and this biological imperative of
dopamine squirts and we like to agree
we&#39;re a country of agree errs yeah there
are some people who don&#39;t agree they&#39;re
like become lawyers or Vice Principals
look look it was the vice principal
yesterday you were totally disagreed
with that so that made sense actually
and confirmation bias is not just
something that happens to adults it
happens when we&#39;re kids I was talking to
my grandson who just turned seven about
Santa Claus and I was saying you know
what Liam it takes us four hours to get
to Grandma&#39;s house right yeah but you&#39;d
claim that Santa Claus could make it
around the world and one night how do
you explain that and he said you know
what pop up you know nothing about Santa
Claus you you&#39;re old
he had a point but he also had another
another thing about what he said led me
to another barrier we have when it comes
to fast and that has to do with the
credibility of the source granted I am
NOT a credible source when it comes to
Santa Claus I admitted that but when it
comes to facts what are we gonna do with
all this all the sources were getting
you know back in the 70s sorry I&#39;m old
as my friend son pointed out back in the
70s we had two sources of information
for infor news claims and facts we had
the newspaper where we had editorial
boards with integrity newspaper stories
did not get published unless it was
vetted there was no such thing as fake
news and then we had television we had
Walter Cronkite you may know Walter the
most trusted man in America when Walter
said it everybody believed it was true
there was no confusion we had confidence
let&#39;s come to the present and what do we
have Google Twitter Facebook the
blogosphere snapchat seriously people
are getting their news from sources that
are not vetted that are not curated do
you know that Google has 3.5 billion
hits a day 40,000 searches a second if
you started tracking Google when I
started talking we&#39;d be well over a
million searches with no control there&#39;s
no organization that checks what&#39;s
online this is a problem so what we&#39;ve
tried to do is come up with a way to at
least get closer to the truth and to the
facts and the information we get every
day from the internet the first thing
we&#39;ve thought about was something called
inoculation know you don&#39;t have to get a
shot but we use it as a metaphor
inoculation you go to the doctor
prevents the flu well in social
psychology we use inoculation to
describe what happens with persuasion a
lot of times in persuasion you just get
one-sided arguments so researchers have
found that if we force people to look at
another perspective get out of there
come
zone it protects them against the dogma
of the one-sided argument and think
about Facebook you&#39;re in in this echo
chamber where you&#39;re around people who
agree with you you&#39;re getting new
stories that you agree with you&#39;ve got
to get outside that zone and look for
different perspectives alternative
explanations it may not change your mind
but at least it gives you a start of
looking a sort of other perspective
another thing we are a nation of lazy
clickers we like to go to that first
page of Google and stop there and when
we asked our subjects about that they
said yeah the first page it must be true
that&#39;s on the first page no that&#39;s not
true
when you go on a search for Google on a
Google search and looking at links you
need to go to the third page the fourth
page beyond those first pages there&#39;s
something called Google Scholar which
provides you with peer-reviewed articles
that are done by people who&#39;ve done
research and that you had a very very
good chance that that information has
been vetted and then there&#39;s another
feature called verbatim you may not know
about verbatim is really cool because it
filters out your search so that the only
words the words that you use in your
search take you to websites that have
all those words and not some random
words to take you some random crazy
website all right and the next experts
what&#39;s going on with experts I mean over
the last two years they&#39;ve actually been
books written about this that we don&#39;t
rely on experts we don&#39;t need experts we
got WebMD who needs to go to the doctor
okay you need experts experts have done
their whole spent their whole career
doing research in areas that we have no
knowledge of experts are important I
mean who do you want flying your planes
Sully or some guy who just got his
license who do you want doing your
surgery an expert right who do you want
fixing your car an expert so why not
when you go online check for the experts
so the source of the articles or the
claims that are being made that&#39;s there
and by the way if you can&#39;t find a
credible source associated with a claim
or a fact online that fact is not true
so assume that that expert knows what
he&#39;s talking about give them some human
chance or her chance Oh
okay so the next time you go online I&#39;m
going to ask you to do three things
inoculate don&#39;t be a lazy clicker and
trust experts they know what they&#39;re
talking about they fill in the knowledge
that you don&#39;t know all right well I&#39;m
going to conclude with a quote and I
find this ironic because the quote has
been associated with Mark Twain and Will
Rogers and fact-checking tells us that
neither one of these guys said this it&#39;s
crazy man it was in a movie in an ad
Mark Twain it&#39;s like no he didn&#39;t say it
somebody said this so here&#39;s something
you can do when you do your google
search later find out who said this
quote because I think it does a great
summary of what I&#39;ve been trying to tell
you and here&#39;s the quote it&#39;s not what
you don&#39;t know that gets you in trouble
it&#39;s what you know for sure but ain&#39;t so
thank you
