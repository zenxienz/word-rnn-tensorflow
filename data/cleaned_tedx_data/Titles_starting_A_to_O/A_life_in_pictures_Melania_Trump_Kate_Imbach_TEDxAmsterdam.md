one step beyond Donald Trump became
President of the United States in
January of 2017 in April I was still
hooked to the news trying to figure out
who these people were who are now
running my country at the time there was
one particular thing that had captured
my attention Melania Trump the
president&#39;s wife had refused to move
with him to the White House she stayed
at home in Manhattan she said so that
their son Barron could finish his school
year without disruption ironic of course
because the first families continued
presence in the city cause tremendous
disruption and 1 million dollars a day
in security costs why did she do it what
made her think that she could kick off
her new job as first lady by not showing
up I needed to know how her mind worked
so I read some magazine profiles and
watched some interviews but none of them
revealed anything about what really
drove her thinking so I looked at her
Twitter and found there that between
2012 and 2015 she tweeted almost 500
photographs that she took herself now I
believe that everyone has an eye whether
or not we see ourselves as photographers
what we choose to shoot and how we frame
subjects always reveals at least a
little about how we see the world for
someone like Melania media trained
controlled in a longtime public figure
her photographic eye provides an
otherwise unavailable view into her life
so I decided to examine milania&#39;s
Twitter photos as though she were an
artist and they were her body of work it
was a very revealing exercise so now
I&#39;ll show you a small selection of
milania&#39;s photos which I think will show
us just how many secrets about our own
inner lives that we reveal and the
photographs that we post online in those
three years she only posted one
photograph of her and her husband
together he dominates the frame her face
is in shadow and cropped out it&#39;s both a
selfie and an erasure and strange has
her only depiction of her placement
within their world and she is removed
from the rest
of her family too she posted several
photographs of her husband and son
together for each she&#39;s positioned
behind the two of them sometimes
literally from the backseat these
photographs seem to suggest a family
life lived in the background and if she
sees her family from behind she sees the
rest of the world from above she posted
many images of the view from her home in
Trump Tower down in Central Park these
are beautiful colorful images taken by a
photographer with a clear appreciation
for nature but there&#39;s a sadness in the
repetition of this imagery that comes in
the distance between photographer and
subject and Central Park is a place that
Melania loves to admire and at first
glance it might appear that this type of
photograph was taken on foot from inside
the park meaning that she was going out
for a walk every once in a while but
looking closely the snow and tree
branches are blurred with a motion of a
car here again the tree branches are
blurred and the raindrops are never
falling but always stuck to a window and
it&#39;s interesting how she cropped these -
to remove the road it&#39;s as though she
perceives herself to be walking in the
park or wants us to believe that she is
even when she&#39;s only driving past and
when she went to Barcelona and
Washington DC and the Paris Las Vegas
Hotel and Casino she saw those places
from inside a car - and selfies Melania
has some peculiar tendencies she almost
never posted photographs of her whole
face but when she did she blew them out
editing them so much that the contours
of her nose are almost imperceptible in
selfies where she&#39;s not blown out she&#39;s
disguised behind big black sunglasses
and glamorous waves of hair in selfies
where she&#39;s not blown out or disguised
she&#39;s cropped up into pieces this is a
paradox for a woman who&#39;s a former model
a longtime public figure that when she
turns the camera around that when she
represents herself she is obscured
and this instinct to hide extends to her
son in photographs of Baron she always
obscures his face just as she obscures
her own here he&#39;s disguised in the
little boy version of her big black
sunglasses ski goggles this is also the
only photograph she posted of the two of
them together and it eerily mirrors the
lone selfie of her and her husband where
she cropped herself out to remove
herself from the frame but she treats
Baron differently to here there&#39;s no
passivity he&#39;s the actor in motion
swimming and swinging photographically
she composes the world for him that is
much bigger than her own Melania posted
her last photograph to Twitter On June
11th 2015 five days before her husband
announced his candidacy for president
it&#39;s an old photograph of his end six
year old Baron taken on the beach he&#39;s
waving goodbye to a professionally built
sandcastle in the background the je she
chose to post this for image she knew of
course the campaign was coming she must
have known that her husband might win
and in retrospect this choice reads as
prophecy goodbye to her own golden tower
to a palace she knew was destined to
crumble so we&#39;ve done a close reading of
milania&#39;s photographs and now we see her
in a new way maybe more sympathetically
than we did before maybe less but
there&#39;s something deeper here - social
media platforms demand endless visual
imagery but each of these images as
disposable as they may seem in the feed
as quickly as we may scroll past is a
photograph captured by a human being who
has chosen that fraction of a second
with that particular composition to
share by reading these images closely
contrary to the way social media intends
for them to be seen we can reveal
unexpected things maybe even some truth
about another person&#39;s unique experience
of the world around them Melania did
move to the White House eventually of
course on June 11th 2017 bizarrely
exactly two years the day after she
posted this photograph of Barron on the
beach she posted this one
to her new first lady twitter account
her caption looking forward to the
memories we&#39;ll make in our new home
hashtag moving day exclamation point and
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that
she chose a perspective with candle fire
curtains a window frame iron bars and
the pillars of the White House itself
sitting as barriers between her and the
rest of her new city Washington DC thank
you
