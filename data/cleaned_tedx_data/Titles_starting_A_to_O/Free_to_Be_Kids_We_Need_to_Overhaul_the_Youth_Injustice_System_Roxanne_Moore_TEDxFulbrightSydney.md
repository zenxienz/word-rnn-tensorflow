when we try to fix something we assume
it was once working right so has the
criminal justice system in Australia
ever treated all children fairly and if
not can it be fixed I&#39;m a proud normal
woman and indigenous rights campaigner
for Amnesty International I begin by
acknowledging the traditional custodians
of the land on which we meet the gadigal
people and pay my respects to elder&#39;s
past present and those yet to come
this always was and always will be
Aboriginal land so to understand this
question let&#39;s go back to the beginning
childhood
this is a photo of me and my sister when
I was about 10 we were always often our
bikes exploring the ocean and the bush
just free to be kids and of course I
made mistakes and got in trouble but I
never would have thought the prison was
a possibility but if this audience were
all of the kids in prison in Australia
today over half of you would be
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
kids even though our kids only make up a
tiny fraction of those under 17 years
old and this is even worse for
indigenous girls so to understand why
let&#39;s go back to our past when the
British arrived the first Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander prisoners were
prisoners of war in the frontier wars
and they were captives that is if they
weren&#39;t killed and this moved to an idea
of protection and that&#39;s when the
colonizers started building prison
because protection involved controlling
every aspect of indigenous people&#39;s
lives and this had criminal consequences
let me give you an example this is an
early prison in Western Australia around
1890 they earned the chains around their
necks from offenses like stop killing
you could get two or three years per
sheep that was killed and there were
prisoners well under the age of 16 years
for absconded from employment so from
running from the farms where they&#39;re
enslaved to work
and police were moving Aboriginal people
off their land into settlements they
were handing out rations they were the
ones monitoring illegal marriages
between Aboriginal and non-indigenous
people police were taking children from
families intermissions
like my own great-grandmother as part of
the Stolen Generations and when the
courts were set up Aboriginal people
couldn&#39;t testify because they weren&#39;t
Christian and they couldn&#39;t understand
proceedings because it was in English so
it wasn&#39;t very fair and it led to harsh
sentencing from non-indigenous juries
this was the beginning of so-called
youth justice in Australia now they
abandoned that idea of protection and
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people moved back into the towns and
cities and this is when imprisonment
skyrocketed from 1% to one-third
imprisonment became the new segregation
and because our people are so over
imprisoned too many of us have died in
custody from police or other prison of
brutality from lack of medical treatment
or from taking their own lives fast
forward to today in the Northern
Territory a child hooded strapped to a
chair children gassed in Queensland dogs
used to intimidate children hogtied and
sedated in Western Australia a girl
found drench in her own urine after 72
hours of solitary confinement in
Victoria a child&#39;s neck fractured in
Canberra allegations of racial verbal
abuse and physical violence alarming
rates of disability and self-harm in
prisons this is how we treat our
children today and it is a national
tragedy is it any wonder from where
we&#39;ve come from to where we are today
as my colleague and Paolo elder Rani
Dillon said to me
children today do not have the chains
around their necks but they do around
their ankles and because they are 25
times more likely to be those kids in
prison we can&#39;t escape that this is
mostly happening to Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander kids now it&#39;s got
to do with disadvantage as well because
indigenous kids are more likely to be
removed from their families they&#39;re more
likely to have disability or mental
health or other health issues which in
turn mean that they&#39;re more likely to go
to prison so indigenous girls for
example in prison most of them are are
themselves victims of violence and keeps
it being locked up mostly for offenses
like theft public order offences traffic
offences in some cases for stealing a
chocolate frog or being charged with
stealing bread but we have to look at
the police and the courts as well
because police are far less likely to
caution an Aboriginal child but they&#39;re
far more likely to charge them and
courts are more likely to sentence an
Aboriginal child but indigenous kids are
less likely to have access to a lawyer
so youth justice or injustice system and
can you ever really read a system like
this of the racism and inequality that
it was built on what if we didn&#39;t try to
fix it what if we tried a different
approach now I&#39;ve spent time as a
Fulbright Scholar considering this
question of racial injustice over in the
United States but it was only when I
came back to Australia and sat down with
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
communities around the country in this
work for Amnesty International that the
answers suddenly became clear because
for this seemingly impossible problem we
can learn from an old way a time before
prisons from indigenous people this is
Angela and David salmon cofounders of
Mona aboriginal corporation
I spent time with them in their cultural
horsemanship program now this is just
outside of Mount either in Queensland
and here they bring children together
with community mentors and connects them
back with the land and with culture and
they instill in them confidence from
cooking to cleaning to education to how
to handle and train a horse they help
them with trauma from people who
understand and we sat around the
campfire and we yond with elders some
who&#39;d grown up there right on country
and the kids just loved it they told me
how the program helped them how they
felt free route out on the land and the
program got rave reviews from the local
primary schools principals of the town
Angela says she just wants to see her
kids walking with their heads held high
now over to Burke in New South Wales
hear there&#39;s been steady progress with
the Mara Norco justice reinvestment
project led by the community there where
they&#39;re getting everyone around the
table so police teachers judges and
they&#39;re all looking at how they can take
that money that was spent on locking
kids up which as we&#39;ve seen is harmful
and it doesn&#39;t stop crime and put that
back into the community to help families
and kids be stronger happier healthier
and the same idea of justice
reinvestment in the u.s. has seen the
closure of numerous prisons in places
like Texas now that young Aboriginal
fellow you saw earlier in the hood
strapped to the chair Dylan voila him
and I traveled to Canberra together
recently and I heard him speak to
politicians about the power of the
Aboriginal run program bush mob in Alice
Springs where he was bailed to in his
words it&#39;s this program that is the
reason that he&#39;s still out of prison
today this is a young fella who has seen
the worst of the system been in it since
he was very young and yet has become a
strong advocate on youth justice issues
he wants it to be made available to more
children
now these programs exist right around
the country and they work but they
struggle to get funding and support
they&#39;re often run by elders and
community members out of the love of
their hearts there&#39;s no national
leadership for this change even though
this is clearly an australia-wide shame
so we find ourselves at a crossroads we
can continue down this path where we
lock up and abuse generations of
indigenous kids in a system that has
never treated them fairly chains around
their ankles history repeating itself or
we can take a different path one towards
creating future leaders by supporting
communities look it&#39;s not going to fix
discrimination but it will stop
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
children from getting stuck in this
youth injustice system and it will help
them out of the quicksand of it if when
they&#39;re stuck in it because it is like a
quicksand once you&#39;re in it&#39;s very hard
to get out and most children return as
adults so if we believe that Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander children
deserve to grow up in their communities
not behind bars
then we owe it to the next generation to
call out our political leaders for a
national overhaul of this youth
injustice system for a better way a way
with indigenous communities and their
answers at the center for a future where
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
kids are no longer shackled by our past
but we&#39;re like all other children they
can be free to be kids thank you
