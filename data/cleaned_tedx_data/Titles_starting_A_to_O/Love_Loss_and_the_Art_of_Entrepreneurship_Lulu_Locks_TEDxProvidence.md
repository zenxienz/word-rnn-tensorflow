in 2007 I fell in love it started so
gently we set up dates we spend time and
then all of a sudden there were morning
obligations and evening obligations and
before I even knew what was happening I
was completely enraptured and I was
changed my name is Lulu LOX and I am an
entrepreneur and I&#39;m here to tell you
about how I fell in love with an idea
and how it nearly destroyed itself and
me in the process at the very beginning
of the Great Recession I had to sigh and
I&#39;d had enough I was all set with being
somebody&#39;s employee I had tried all the
things I had been an educator for a
national hair color company I had worked
in retail I&#39;ve been a sales rep it was
time for me to be self-employed but I
did not see that recession coming and I
knew that I had something that I was
going to be able to do with the
right-half and it came to me I decided
that if I could take 400 dollars that I
had borrowed from my grocery budget ten
hours a week and continually reinvest
into my own passions I could do
something really cool I mean I&#39;m
watching all of my friends spend
hundreds of hours and thousands of
dollars on college what if I took the
same type of focus and I gave it to
myself so we started small it was this
great photo pop-up business called
Providence pinup where I chose to take
old clothing fabulous stylists a whole
lot of enter
gee and get together at various
locations all over Rhode Island in order
to create a beautiful timeless image it
was crazy I could not believe that in
this moment in economic history I&#39;m
standing here with a Barbie doll company
convincing people that they should dress
up an old-fashioned clothing and I&#39;m
building a business so it started as
quarterly and then it was monthly and
then it was weekly and sometimes we hear
it was full weekends and sneaking in a
weeknight and it was just out of control
morning noon and night he was all about
developing this business I was well
beyond my 10 hours a week but four years
in my college college time goal it was
there the opportunity to merge my
hairstyling business which was I was
actively pursuing plus my photo business
and if I rolled it all into one location
I could create this great good space
that would allow me to be more than just
a hair cutter because I was more than a
hair just a hair cutter I&#39;m a
photographer I&#39;m an artist and anyone
that works in a creative field is
someone that wants to do more than just
that one thing I wanted to have a space
where we could be more than just so I
made it and it was great and the
opportunities were absolutely endless I
was invited to be on local television
we got great press I was invited to work
at the Institute of Contemporary Art in
Boston the Museum of Modern Art in New
York and I even got to participate in a
performance art piece during the Whitney
Biennial I had a solo performance at
there is new museum it was absolutely
dumbfounded to me that all of these
opportunities were happening so quickly
and it made me feel so good
it was easy to do so we opened this
great brick-and-mortar and four years in
I decide to remodel and like an a
startup company does you wrestle that
furniture into a corner without really
thinking about it and I got our little
bruise on my calf a couple of days later
I ended up with the flu so I&#39;m Hawking
I&#39;m coughing I&#39;m wheezing I can&#39;t
breathe so I choose to sleep in a
recliner rather than driving my wife
insane but I didn&#39;t pay attention to the
bruise or the spot on the leg lifts that
hit my leg and I ended up with a little
teeny superficial thrombophlebitis or a
blood clot I was told that a little rest
a little elevation a little
anti-inflammatory I would be fine
a few weeks later I wasn&#39;t fine the clot
had spread through my entire leg and it
was threatening to become what&#39;s called
a DVT or a killer clot so we added
medication and some sexy stockings to
the mix a couple months later of more
wait-and-see and I still was not fine
and I learned that I have a genetic
quirk great I have a genetic quirk thank
you so much that this happened with an
injury and not a heart attack or a
stroke I had the privilege of having an
injury at a young age that helped me see
that I am genetically unique but it also
meant that everything had to come to a
full stop
I left my doctor&#39;s office I sat in my
car i sat up straight I called the
fashion designer I was supposed to work
with and I cancelled working for her I
cancelled the vacation I was supposed to
leave for because I wasn&#39;t cleared for
travel and I bawled my eyes out for the
first time in my life I had no idea what
I was going to do so I pushed I rushed I
stressed I diversified my business model
I grabbed an opportunity to expand my
business
I felt so smart because these were the
last little moves that I had to do in
order to have financial security but boy
howdy did I fail it was awful
I never completed the beginning the
remodel in my storefront I made rush
decisions in hiring I did all of the
worst possible things that you could do
when you&#39;re in crisis so I took a breath
I undid what I had to do or I undid what
I had done and I move forward you take a
few knocks you get your heart broken you
pay a few bills you make your apologies
and you carry on and much like with
everything I&#39;ve always done in my life
and like my fabulous British roots have
taught me you keep calm and carry on I
dusted myself off and I got back to work
I took care of my clients I pretended
everything was absolutely fine of course
I told my story to those that would
listen but it was mortifying and I was
absolutely lost in depression I couldn&#39;t
get out of bed I couldn&#39;t function and I
find myself reaching for answers and
what I find is that I do well with
research I learned about this really
wonderful concept that entrepreneurs
view their businesses with the same part
of their brain as parents do children so
you don&#39;t see the bad stuff and all you
see is the good stuff and was it this
love affair that made it so easy for me
to build a business when everything else
was so hard I stopped and I considered
the stages of grief was I mourning my
body was I mourning the possibility that
I was going to lose everything
was I in denial that I had the strength
to carry on was i angry when I made poor
decisions
was I depressed was a bargaining with
myself that my last push could save me
so all that was left was acceptance now
the thing that I needed to accept is
that I am Who I am and I&#39;m really good
at transformation but the more I worked
through this transformation the more I
recognized that what I needed to do was
go back to how my heart felt in the
beginning my community was right in
front of me I had built this great good
space where ideas were happening and
friendships were being made and people
were happy I had been so lost in this
love affair and the momentum of what I
had the opportunity to build that I had
lost my core values in my core ethics so
I decided to do the most uncomfortable
thing of all and that&#39;s to stand in
front of a huge room and tell you all of
my deepest worst concerns and fears and
failures because we all must change
every single one of us is going to reach
a point in our lives where we choose to
change a career we end in education we
take care of a loved one we have a baby
and that moment is going to create some
of the most painful devastating intimate
feelings that you have ever had and it&#39;s
going to be absolutely terrifying to
tell anyone but with good balance and
good people around you you can enjoy the
sunsets and the friends and the family
and the better balance that comes and I
hope that this terrifying moment serves
at least some of you
when you&#39;re ready to make a change thank
you
