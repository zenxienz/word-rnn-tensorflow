I love obituaries I do I love them I
love how people summarize their lives
I&#39;m amazed that people can put those
words into one little column and every
character costs money so you have to be
very intentional about what words are
going in because it&#39;s gonna cost money
if your name goes into someone&#39;s
obituary that&#39;s like five dollars your
way right I have friends who are writers
and I admire them and they&#39;re in these
writing circles and I always tell them I
want my own writing circle but I want it
to be just obituaries I want to write my
own obituary and the only people I&#39;m
inviting into my circle are good friends
who know me well and her willing to be
honest because my greatest fear is that
my family while grieving won&#39;t be able
to write the right things and they&#39;re
going to say and you may need to know me
to appreciate how wrong this is
she was a tremendous homemaker she
wasn&#39;t she was a wonderful mother she
you know always decorated the house for
Halloween or etc and and anyone who
knows me knows it&#39;s just flat wrong
right it would say she hated bake sales
she decorated once for the holidays in
2011 and she will never get the mother
of the Year award but she would give
everything every last minute every last
dime to save someone she loves and my
father was the exact same way his death
two years ago was a complete surprise
and it shouldn&#39;t have been he wasn&#39;t hit
by truck and fall from a plane it wasn&#39;t
lost to the Amazon he had cancer
had cancer for years and he didn&#39;t beat
it and yet my family my tight-knit
family was completely surprised I think
we were surprised for several reasons we
were surprised that he
wasn&#39;t immortal but he was the first to
go he would walk 18 holes of golf every
other day and he&#39;d carry his own clubs
hate all brand every morning for
breakfast I just want you to stop for a
minute there because in my mind if you
can eat all brand we all know it you
deserve to live forever
we were we were surprised by the fact
that he went from our caregiver to our
care receiver and my big six and a half
foot tall strong father was able to let
the rest of us and needed the rest of us
to do it on him and we were surprised
that our smart you know PhD law student
Wall Street brother entrepreneurial
father were completely unprepared the
truth of the matter is we shouldn&#39;t have
been surprised right he had cancer 100
percent of us are born to people older
than us right and I kept trying to find
where maybe that wasn&#39;t true so that
nobody would raise their hands and say
hey Stephanie actually I know someone
who was born to a baby there they were
saying babies it was true 100 percent of
us are born to someone older - older
than us and yet I felt like the world
didn&#39;t prepare me for what was happening
to our family I kept looking and there
was no guidebook no road map 20 years
earlier I was pregnant with my oldest
daughter Isabella and I read this book
what to Expect When You&#39;re Expecting
great it&#39;s been around for 25 years 656
pages of everything you need to know
about nurturing the fetus birthing the
baby feeding the baby sending it to
school everything that you need to know
completely comprehensive so much
information that I
to become paranoid of all the things
that could go wrong that had no idea
could even happen right got rid of the
book so my surprise when I was on the
other end of my life taking care of
someone that I had known far more than a
nine-month gestational period someone
who I loved and adored for decades and I
had know what to expect
I had no book where&#39;s my what to expect
and I would retitle that book what to
expect that you are not expecting that
you should totally expect right now how
are we hidden by this and after it
happened I started to go crazy and
anybody who knows me knows all I did was
grab people saying hey what&#39;s up with
your parents are they okay what&#39;s your
plan for your parents are you do you
have a plan do you have a budget do you
fly Southwest that&#39;s important Southwest
doesn&#39;t charge change fees right and you
don&#39;t know when you need to be someplace
you need to fly Southwest you need to
have this budget first chapter my book
would be you need to expect to be a
medical expert fast my first major
medical decision and I did not go to law
school was in a small grey hospital room
in Savannah Georgia my parents were at a
dinner party
and Saturday night we had friends over
for dinner that night as well and I
remember it because I look at my phone I
have a missed call from my mom and a
message that&#39;s Saturday night and I
don&#39;t know about you guys my parents
don&#39;t call on Saturday nights they don&#39;t
want to impose they don&#39;t want to
interrupt us and I didn&#39;t even have to
listen to that message to know I need to
jump on a plane and get to Savannah so I
grabbed the first flight from Dallas to
Savannah we all did and I&#39;m in this
little hospital room with my uncle who&#39;s
my dad&#39;s brother and very best friend
my Gucci clad Wall Street brother which
you can only say when you&#39;re from Iowa
because you were just not used to that
my mother who&#39;s reading piles of Good
Housekeeping magazines pretending that
this isn&#39;t really happening and in the
middle of the room is my father on the
bed right he&#39;s the star of the show and
I remember looking at the room looking
at my big strong on goal I&#39;m a very
smart brother my mom and saying I don&#39;t
know who loves him most we all loved him
so much and if love could cure cancer my
father would have jumped out of that bed
and run out cancer-free but instead his
oncologist came in who I would say also
loved my father and this young man is
sitting at the bottom of my dad&#39;s bed
and he says Bob I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
anything else we can do I don&#39;t think
your body is strong enough to endure
more chemotherapy these conversations
are always hardest when the patient has
beaten all odds to this point I think
you need to consider Hospice you know
you can go to the hospice facility on
this side of town and you can go home
and Hospice comes to you and my father
says what if I went home got stronger
and came back for more chemotherapy it&#39;s
worth that and before that sweet
oncologist could answer my father my dad
looks at me he goes Stef what do you
think what do I think I&#39;m in that&#39;s what
I think you want to go home get stronger
I&#39;ll make you stronger you want to come
back here and sit through more
chemotherapy I will sit through more
chemotherapy I&#39;m gonna do everything I
can in my power to save you we went home
got some weights and that&#39;s that leg
lifts and everything that you need when
you&#39;re on on bed rest and the next
chapter was written fairly quickly which
is quit your job plan to bring a job
because you can&#39;t be in two places at
the same time and I didn&#39;t be an island
off of Savannah Georgia I could be here
working raising three children and my
family and I wanted every ounce of me
wanted to be with my father ironically I
worked at the Dallas Women&#39;s Foundation
so when I went to resign my CEO Rosalind
said I can&#39;t let you quit our entire
mission is to empower women to keep them
from being financially vulnerable due to
their roles as caregivers and you&#39;re
doing the very thing that we&#39;re trying
to prevent go be with your dad the
caveat to that chapter or a quick short
chapter right after that would be hey
don&#39;t expect that to happen guys don&#39;t
think back I&#39;m like whoa what happened
it&#39;s like Forbes magazine just released
an article that a record number of 50
year old women are leaving their careers
to go take care of their parents
basically what&#39;s happening is we&#39;re
watching the ship sink and we&#39;re all
jumping in it and we&#39;re trying to keep
the water from coming in and we&#39;re
trying to block it all and meanwhile
we&#39;re moving so fast and everything&#39;s
frantic and if we&#39;d had a plan it
wouldn&#39;t have to be that way right
because as hard as it was watching my
father die there were beautiful moments
that I would have missed out on if I
wasn&#39;t there I remember when the hospice
doctor finally came to his house I
pulled her assigned to another room and
without anybody hearing me said listen I
need to know how much time we have now
because I think you&#39;re the crystal ball
now because I think you have any godlike
qualities but because I need to make a
very important decision while he&#39;s still
coherent you see my father took care of
all of the financial matters between
my mother and my father for 60 years and
she doesn&#39;t know where everything is and
he does and I have to figure that out
right now and she and I said or I can
talk to him about the things that matter
and she said I think you should talk
about the things that matter I have
found in my experience that all the
other things fall into place but it
wouldn&#39;t even have mattered what she
responded with because I would have
talked to him about the things that
matter we had this these wood kitchen
stools in the kitchen and I took a
kitchen stool and I placed it next to my
father&#39;s bed and I sat on that stool and
I&#39;m hovered over his face like a turkey
vulture and that poor man he couldn&#39;t
move right this is my hostage and every
time his eyes would kind of flutter
stuff him with I love yous and I feel
like at one point he raised his hand
like enough like when you&#39;ve eaten too
many pancakes right like no more Stefan
without love you tell him you&#39;re the
greatest father ever ask him how&#39;d you
meet my mother
I know how he met my mother they were 13
years old and they met at cotillion
everybody in my family my giant family
knows this story but I wanted to hear
his version of the love story in his
words and I had one chance to do it
right it was a hard decision and I don&#39;t
regret it for a minute I made that
decision so the next day when he passed
away I&#39;m sitting on the living room
floor about this space except you know
I&#39;ve worn nothing but pajamas for six
weeks straight so imagine me and pajamas
which I didn&#39;t wear today but I didn&#39;t
think about wearing them
I&#39;m sitting on the floor and I&#39;m
surrounded with papers and numbers just
a mess and my mother walks in and she
stands in front of me and she is petite
to begin with but she&#39;s even more petite
she looks frail and I described this and
my brother agreed with me
she was anchor &#39;less she just never 73
and they&#39;ve been together since they
were 13 and she&#39;s looking at me like I&#39;m
the white house and she says your father
always assured me that we were going to
be okay and that we had enough you do
but in the back of my head was I just
got to find it right in that moment I
went from my father&#39;s medical expert to
my mother&#39;s financial archaeologist
right and I&#39;m like what are all these
documents what is everything what did he
do for 20 years after he sold his
business he invested their money it was
everywhere at least to me it seemed that
way no my father knew exactly where it
was he knew where all those numbers were
he knew his financial advisors I didn&#39;t
and my mom didn&#39;t and I kept thinking
where are all these financial advisors
now and why aren&#39;t they flying to this
island to help me take care of my mother
and if they would have arrived to the
island the second question I would have
asked them is why didn&#39;t you budget for
love you I see the investment strategies
for your retirement account size I see
what you&#39;ve spent on college education
from me and Gucci
all worth it see what you spent on
weddings I see all this but nowhere in
here do I see budgeting for love
budgeting for care budgeting for cancer
budgeting for a daughter who&#39;s gonna
quit her job and fly to this island or
budgeting for a nursing staff to come
take care of you full-time budgeting to
stay in your home and retrofit it so
that you can live with ease or budgeting
for an expensive assisted living
facility I don&#39;t see the budget for that
I got angry you know angry at this whole
world that focuses so much on what to
expect when you&#39;re expecting a baby and
nothing on caring for my beloved 73 year
old father angry that the financial
sector had us duped into thinking that
saving for retirement is simply making
sure that you have the same amount of
assets when you&#39;re no longer working and
that&#39;s what you need or that you&#39;re a
lovely couple with you know thick gray
hair and big white teeth and you you&#39;re
sailing off somewhere together I hate
the pictures are always the same
I won&#39;t grade that well my husband
really doesn&#39;t have that much hair right
now
and I&#39;m a mountain person not a water
person so even the picture is wrong for
me the whole thing was wrong
I wanted my what to expect now maybe
maybe they would come back and say your
father didn&#39;t want to talk about aging
he didn&#39;t want to talk about losing his
independence II didn&#39;t want to talk
about cancer your mom definitely didn&#39;t
want to talk about it okay I get that
it&#39;s a hard topic and people don&#39;t want
to talk about adult diapers I don&#39;t want
to talk about Alzheimer&#39;s and forgetting
the names of the people you love they
don&#39;t want to talk about writing a will
dividing your assets and picking
somebody else to raise your children
instead of you I they don&#39;t want to talk
about saying goodbye forever to the
people who need you and love you most
how are they supposed to do their jobs
if nobody&#39;s going to talk about this how
are we gonna talk about this
the final chapter what to expect us
don&#39;t talk about it then don&#39;t talk
about it talking about babies talk about
babies talk about being pregnant rub
people&#39;s stomachs no matter what right
give them unsolicited advice
change the topic and change the
vocabulary right because people love
talking about that stuff so people must
love talking about love
talk about love Pokemon live instead
change the vocabulary to all this write
the story of your obituaries right right
and while your friends are around so you
can make sure that you&#39;re in them you
might not know died unexpectedly or
hounded by people you love
you know you won&#39;t know the Front&#39;s and
the bottoms of those of you who read
obituaries like I do you know exactly
what I&#39;m talking about right you&#39;ll know
the middle you can do the middle but you
can definitely rewrite your will right
you can definitely write that part of
your plan and you could write it like a
love letter and I&#39;ll give you my example
step three children and you have to put
aside for a minute and this has always
been a big problem for my children and I
always have to you can&#39;t divide things
equally amongst three so somebody feel
free to come up to me afterwards can
have that 1% that nobody else gets but
I&#39;m gonna start like this there Isabella
Jacqueline and Christian
if you know nothing else in life you
know how much I love you you are my
favorite people ever not because I
birthed you
because I&#39;m far more objective than that
because you&#39;re smart and interesting and
you make me laugh and I love you equally
but uniquely and so I&#39;ve divided up my
assets equally but uniquely and you if
you think I&#39;ve done it wrong and work it
out and I believe cuz if you don&#39;t I&#39;m
gonna haunt you all right I&#39;m gonna
haunt you and you might have to be one
of my children to appreciate this part
but and if you think I&#39;m scary as a
human mom huh wait time ago small right
of course I kept it with xoxo mom right
change the vocabulary I don&#39;t think this
book what to expect that you aren&#39;t
expecting that you totally need to
expect he&#39;s gonna be hard to write
father&#39;s been gone for two years
somebody asked me the other day when did
he pass away and I said he&#39;s been over
for two years and they said it seems
like yesterday I said because I talk
about it all the time right and I would
talk about it more if I was around
people all the time I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
gonna be hard to write and I refuse to
let it go unwritten I love the people I
love in the world they live in I would
give every minute every last second
every last dime to save someone
and the truth of the matter is they
deserve to know what to expect
[Applause]
