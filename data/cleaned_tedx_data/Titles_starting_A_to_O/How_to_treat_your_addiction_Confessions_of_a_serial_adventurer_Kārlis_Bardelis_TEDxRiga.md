hello my name is Carlos and I am
addicted first time when I noticed my
addiction was when I sat by the piano at
age of six without any knowledge or
notes I just let myself go the
composition was both flowing and very
impulsive
overwhelmed by the creative process I
was delighted
my sister was shouting stop it it sounds
horrible you don&#39;t know how to play
my grandma however told her to stop
interrupting me as I was composing I had
no idea what composing meant but the
composing was really cool
I felt very similar when I was in
mountains 14 years later first the
creative process in my childhood was
true to the bone and after spending two
weeks in the middle of adventure every
one of our group became just as true
second if you wanted to climb a new
route you have to improvise without any
instructions or descriptions I had some
adventure improvisations before with
Nordic skates with ice axes and crampons
with skis with bicycles as the years
passed my addiction had become worse
when I sat at the place where the road
meets the vastness of an ocean I was
wondering is the end of the road also
the end of the adventure I set it ashore
until I started to see a new road which
stretched between the waves that was the
road that I was about to follow just
like that a new addiction was born we
wanted to cross the South Atlantic Ocean
by the new road rowing 6,000 kilometers
in the ocean rowing boat without in
sails without a motor
and without the support vessel from
Namibia to Summer Olympic and Paralympic
Games in Rio de Janeiro my first up an
instructor said write a diary because
you won&#39;t be able to recall things later
well he taught me many important things
but this wasn&#39;t one of them I knew it I
would remember everything what is worth
remembering here Lee tears blended with
salty coastal water the tears were not
mine but gains my rowing partners we had
just left the harbor and he started to
cry a bit shy tears of joy and then he
laughed and said yeah man thanks for
this bright idea thank you for being
here I had known Gaines for eight years
and already then I knew that Gaines had
experienced a lot he was a journalist he
had worked as a news editor a business
consulting instructor he had been a
manager of several companies he had two
grown-up sons however I had never ever
seen Gaines crying our minds were still
polluted with the thoughts of dry land
we couldn&#39;t believe that the seal didn&#39;t
want anything from us suddenly it dived
into depth headfirst leaving just his
hind flippers before above the water
slowly moving them in all directions it
reminded us of a strange dance the seal
was just enjoying itself during the
night we could observe its dancing
around the boat as soon as it moved just
a couple of metres below the water the
water immediately shone with the
countless bluish lights those were al
gay making the seals tail look much
longer observing the seal who was just
enjoying being in his natural
environment was so easy and natural that
we even forgot to take a picture of it
[Applause]
as far as that I can see there is only
pulsing desert of water then it gets
dark and couple of hours later orange
moon rises about the black horizon as it
gets higher it rolls out the carpet of
silver light the light gently touches
the boat and shows us the way like
compass we were rowing in two hour
shifts one rose for two hours then rest
for two hours and this goes on for
twenty-four hours a day
what new or different can be found it&#39;s
such a perfect adjusted routine well
remember if you want a row you have to
row while sitting on the rowing seat but
for the third week I couldn&#39;t sit down
at all
antibiotics weren&#39;t helping to deal with
the serious health problems caused by
the lack of vitamins and and fresh food
we had gone one third of our way and
doctors recommended us to evacuate
ourselves we were supposed to come up
with something else anyone who has ever
row the boat knows how naive the idea to
roll while standing is naive yet it was
the only solution we could come up with
two stalks forward one backwards but
slowly and patiently we learnt a new
technique what is the feeling when your
naive solution works
[Music]
[Applause]
your alarm rings it&#39;s two o&#39;clock in the
night the coziness of a small cabin
surrounds you with a delicate warm you
can hear approaching waves from afar it
starts up like a drag race car a bomb
and it crashes into six millimeters play
with wall that separates you from the
ocean refreshed by the two hours of
sleep I even managed to dry my clothes
and it looks like I&#39;m hesitating to
change the completely soaked begins no
the real fun is about to begin I switch
on the right frequency someone might
call it a barrier a shield or something
like that but I don&#39;t have a time to
think i just opened the hatch and jump
out once again arriving in my fun mode
in my fun channel jeans was saying
something but 90% of the words were
taking by the wind I shut the camping
door from outside and got myself quickly
in a rowing position I tried to focus I
tried to see something in the dark where
should I be rowing now I could see
absolutely nothing
I was closely watching the dark on the
Left I was holding on to the railing
suddenly six buckets of refreshing salt
water in my face yeah thank you wave
thank you ocean attention attention
Gilardi this is rowing boat Lee in the
rowing gone Linda do you hear us that is
how seven metres long boat starts a chat
with the 330 meters long tanker
immediately it agreed to be stopped in
the middle of ocean the crew didn&#39;t care
about losing time or any other potential
losses the seamen were ready
share everything give us a full list
guys don&#39;t be shy the most important
things were vitamin Sun and fresh food
but we were also been dreaming of cheese
sandwiches for a month
and without any reference to superficial
supernatural and and Hollywood the
cliche dreams do come true only if you
wish them strong enough well I can
honestly say dreams literally came true
in front of our eyes the semen were
lowering Christmas gifts into our boat
in the middle of July
can you imagine stopping a fuel truck
driver to ask him for a plaster but he
also offers his dinner to on dry land my
brain filters countless gigabytes of
information videos photos fake newsreel
truth some bullshit but here in the
ocean I got one text message per day
sometimes one every two days 160 signs
from outside world those were messages
from home messages from my loved ones I
remember rereading a reward tens of
times I imagine hearing every word in
person my inner rater had freed itself
from all the useless gigabytes and these
small truthful sincerity stud The
Horizon of my heart the slowest way to
Rio had completely justified its name
instead of 100 nights it was the night
148 thousand kilometers behind us but it
doesn&#39;t matter we have 20 kilometers to
the shore and we can&#39;t reach it
the boils keep coming back or over our
bodies genes has broken his ribs two
weeks ago upstream headwinds even when
two of us are rowing together we&#39;ve been
throwing further and further back into
the ocean we&#39;ve been months too late for
the Olympic
a week too late for Paralympics
and just the very core idea of our goal
was to roll without an engine and sales
I want to go ashore Carles I really want
to go ashore please make let&#39;s just try
for one more day
I switch off the navigation monitors so
I no longer have to see at what speed we
are drifting away from the coast
meanwhile Keynes was praying for a
miracle we waited in silence I was
trying to get rid of the tension if it&#39;s
not meant to happen it&#39;s not going to
happen
and I and I let go of something inside
of me and felt relieved and two hours
later the stream took both to the north
then to the northwest and by the evening
of the next day

[Applause]
I can still see thousand questions in
some faces in the audience what about
sharks what about whales how did you eat
how did you charge your batteries well
you can ask all those questions to
Google just as we did before this
adventure the most important thing what
I wanted to tell you is what I believe
in I believe in two tiers I believe in
true joy I believe in to humanity and I
still believe in two miracles
my diagnosis is simple and luckily it&#39;s
for life I&#39;m addicted I&#39;m addicted to
freedom do you think you&#39;re not addicted
thank you
[Applause]
