please welcome Donald Pollard first of
all I&#39;d like to say thank you thank you
for having this opportunity for me to
stand here I&#39;ve always wanted this
chance to tell this story I want to
start today from a quote quote from
Mahatma Gandhi and that quote is we but
mirror the world all the tendencies
present in the outer world are to be
found in the world of our body if we
could change ourselves the tendencies in
the world would also change as a man
changes his own nature so does the
attitude of the world change towards him
this is the divine mystery supreme a
wonderful thing that is and the source
of our happiness we need not wait to see
what others do now over the years that
code has changed a bit you may know it
as simply be the change you wish to see
I am a father I&#39;m an educator I&#39;m a
menswear designer and I&#39;m gonna hand I&#39;m
an entrepreneur I&#39;m a creative a
critical thinker and a change agent
I grew up right here in Harrisburg PA
and for as long as I could remember my
mother was in the audience always said
that I taught myself how to walk and at
the age of three I was often found next
door at my neighbor&#39;s house drinking
coffee I received my formal education
here from kindergarten all the way up to
undergraduate school and it was there
that I started having these questions
questions
I was an inquisitive child and I was
quite dyslexic I often found peace and
comfort and simply being alone I fell in
love with jazz at around the age of five
and I collected fashion magazines for as
far back as I could remember the home
that I grew up in was a loving nurturing
environment successful to family
household no dog no white picket fence
but I had a sister but it was there that
I learned three important things see I
was always taught you can we support you
and most of all we love you as mentioned
I graduated from Bishop McDevitt in 1992
and at that time I often had those
questions see for the majority of my
life outside of the home I grew up in I
was always rejected I was always told no
now we can all agree that rejection is a
part of life right but the rejections
that I was faced with were always
directly associated and correlated to my
dreams my passions and my aspirations
because whenever I had visions of doing
anything outside of the norm and I would
share those visions with anybody outside
of my immediate family I was always told
you think too broad
you&#39;re an idealist and my personal
favorite you&#39;re too deep and I never
could understand why they would say that
see the difficulty of experiencing this
was being faced with the uncertainties
the lack of trust the inability to
connect to someone see when I was coming
up there in Harrisburg
there was no go-to person there was no
mentor there was no one that I could
simply bounce an idea off of I didn&#39;t
have anyone to guide me and there was no
one in my neighborhood that could help
shape and mold my ideas and my
aspirations from that aspiration to
fruition now I didn&#39;t know it then but I
definitely know it now the home I grew
up in I was very blessed and fortunate
because I knew what the sense of
security felt like I knew what love felt
like and I knew what support felt like
but the harsh realities of this world is
not every home is created equal and
because of that most of us growing up we
have a tendency to try to find those
resources some of my peers found those
resources and sports now don&#39;t get me
wrong I played football and basketball
and I was pretty good
but that wasn&#39;t my endgame I had that
inner voice in me right and my peers
they probably had that same inner voice
in them as well but because they too
didn&#39;t see anybody in their
neighborhoods that resembled their
interests well they didn&#39;t listen that
or they just simply follow suit I didn&#39;t
I listen to my inner voice and because
my interests weren&#39;t based totally
around bouncing a ball or scoring
touchdowns I left I had my sights set on
New York and Brooklyn became my home for
many years now it wasn&#39;t New York City
that I was most fascinated about it was
the people it was the people in the
community that developed programs for
the youth constructive programs the
constructive programs that taught the
youth life skills learning skills
now it was there that I felt a
connection it was a place where I felt
that I belong now at an early age yes I
knew exactly what I wanted to do I knew
I wanted to work in the fashion industry
and someday I wanted to become a college
professor now I just simply wanted to
take the work that I was doing in the
field and intersect that in the
classroom I want it to be for somebody
that I didn&#39;t have growing up
so since leaving Harrisburg I&#39;ve been
blessed I&#39;ve been very fortunate to
travel and I&#39;ve seen small cities all
across the world that resemble
Harrisburg cities that reminded me of
Harrisburg&#39;s potential small charming
cities but the thing that didn&#39;t remind
me of Harrisburg was opportunity options
got me to thinking about those hard
questions that I came up with when I was
a young kid now please please don&#39;t
misinterpret my words I&#39;m by no means
bashing Harrisburg nor am I making
unrealistic comparisons
I understand Harrisburg is not like New
York however
truth be told I love this city
and I have love for this city I have
love for this city because of its
potential and it&#39;s that potential that I
saw at an early age that spurred those
hard questions so what do we do what do
people like me what do we do where do we
go let&#39;s take a look at Gandhi again
Gandhi&#39;s quote stands as a reminder
because it exposed me to so much
therefore I felt a sense of
responsibility I not only felt a sense
of responsibility for my own happiness
and pursued but I thought a sense of
responsibility from my city I felt like
I was afforded the opportunity to travel
and see the world and be exposed and I
wanted to come back and be that
inspiration to some of you yet I
realized in order to do that we need to
start having these tough conversations
and we as citizens of Harrisburg we need
to start thinking outside the box
because we need to start looking at the
non-traditional opportunities the
non-traditional routes and those
non-traditional options that students
like myself we needed that so I&#39;ll leave
you with these three thoughts number one
I believe we need to create a sense of
thirst a sense of exposure I think we
need to start engaging with our kids at
an early age and exposing them to things
beyond the norm
I think we need to give them the
opportunities at a very young age
number two invest in human capital like
businesses investing in their employees
through trainings and workshops and
seminars a city can do the same thing we
need to focus on bettering the
neighborhoods that are striving the most
and number three let&#39;s start engaging
with each other for example did you know
the Harrisburg has a sister city
relationship with a very unique city in
Israel how awesome would it be to engage
with that city create programming for
the students share ideas share resources
give you another little known fact did
you know Harrisburg had 34 colleges and
institutions within a 50 mile radius how
many of those students that are exposed
to these universities come back and give
back how often do we create the
opportunities for them to share their
ideas and give them a platform to speak
see my work as director of business
development a startup home what we do is
we create co-living and co-working
environments sort of like an
entrepreneurial hub an ecosystem so if
you have a passion about something you
have an idea that you want to start
we hope you build that idea through
incubation services and mentorship
programs to help you get started and get
you along the way
just like you don&#39;t like what you see
when you look in the mirrors sometimes
you go to the gym when you&#39;re at home
and you&#39;re looking at that outdated
kitchen you rebuild it you remodel it
I left Harrisburg and searched for a
place of a belonging I left Harrisburg
so that I can find comfort and
acceptance together we can inspire the
change that we would like to see in this
city for the future to come thank you so
much
[Applause]
