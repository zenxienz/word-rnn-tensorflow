hi everybody
I don&#39;t know if I can follow that but
I&#39;ll have run and I&#39;m gonna talk to you
this evening about how you engage an
audience and which after what we&#39;ve seen
so far is a pretty tough act to follow
and I got to start by telling his story
this story is about the time the first
time I ever left Ireland I was about 18
at the time and I went to New York the
first time I&#39;d ever flown I&#39;d seen the
movies I was very excited I&#39;d seen the
skyline the hotdog stands the yellow
taxis I was all pumped up as far as I
was concerned De Niro and Pacino were
gonna pick me up at the airport we were
going to go into New York City and we
were probably gonna do something really
illegal life is about to start okay so I
arrived in New York my cousin Michael
pick me up now he&#39;s not as dangerous as
some of the characters Pacino&#39;s played
but he&#39;s a nice guy so he picked me up
and as we were putting my luggage into
the car he said something really
interesting
he said porec I hope you don&#39;t mind but
we&#39;re going straight to a party okay
things are picking up
and I ended up at this party within 20
minutes I was in the kitchen drinking
beer which at 18 was illegal in New York
so box ticked
life had just started happening and I
found myself surrounded by beautiful
women haha yeah oh because I just
discovered something about myself do you
know what that was an amazing thing
something I had to leave Ireland to find
out I discovered I had an accent I
didn&#39;t need looks or a personality it&#39;s
just my accent life was starting to get
even better and they just loved the way
I spoke to go like Oh Mary Lou you gotta
listen to this guy say something with
bowels in it they love my father say
something with vowels in it and I go
bold and then I&#39;d see words like
marmalade
they love that word they absolutely love
us because they call it jelly so it&#39;s a
whole new word but I had a lot of vowels
so I don&#39;t use that one like if I really
fancied her so things are going really
well right and then all of a sudden the
door to the kitchen opened and then
walked the guy that owned the house and
he said hey Irish coz they couldn&#39;t
pronounce porec that was far too much to
ask he said hey Irish you want a cold
beer I said I&#39;d love with I&#39;ll get you
one from the refrigerator and then he
turned but then he stopped and he turned
back and he said Irish you guys got
refrigerators in Ireland right and I
thought you know there&#39;d be a little
twinkle in his eye possibly a little
smile nothing and maybe it was the beer
but something in the back of my mind
went let&#39;s see where this goes
so in refrigerator this is yeah dude you
know keeps your beers cold preserves
your food what do you mean you don&#39;t
have to bury it in the garden
to which he went dude he&#39;s gonna mess
your head up and then he walked me
across the kitchen to show me a fridge
no it was America this was probably the
biggest fridge I&#39;d ever seen it was like
floor-to-ceiling top of doors I mean it
was almost like the guy bought a fridge
built a house around this hump boy was
he proud of his fridge
he whipped open the doors and started
dude is where I put the eggs man look
where I put the beers and then at one
point he opened the freezer reached in
pulled out a chicken he said look man I
said it&#39;s a frozen chicken yeah but what
you don&#39;t know is that was fresh when I
put it in no oh my god
at this point I noticed a bottle of
vodka in the fridge I said hey it
doesn&#39;t freeze the vodka no it doesn&#39;t
freeze vodka hold on a minute
you&#39;ve been minted a machine that would
freeze the chicken but won&#39;t freeze
vodka mm-hmm she&#39;s I heard you put a man
on the moon but this is amazing and this
kept going on I asked the dumbest
questions like could it freeze a polar
bear it&#39;s like what do you want to
freeze a polar bear for well they&#39;re
difficult to freeze and about this time
the doorbell wins ding-dong and I went
Jesus what was that dude that&#39;s the
doorbell that&#39;s like how you get into
the house oh my god I wish we had them
in Ireland I&#39;m always locking myself out
of the house and he was about to start
explaining how a doorbell worked when he
kind of stopped himself and he said are
you playing me and I said yeah like a
violin
we&#39;ve got fridges and bells jingle bells
doorbells whatever bells you go we got
them so I like to tell that story
because it&#39;s a funny story no other
reason oh yeah there is another reason
also because that story has a couple of
things that every engaging speaker uses
when they&#39;re trying to engage an
audience yeah things that you&#39;re looking
for right now
every time a speaker walks out here
three key things actually I tell you
what they are but you know already so
I&#39;m gonna get you to tell me
yup for that good I brought some
technology hope you don&#39;t mind
so three things the first one starts
with an i what do you think it is and
you really want us what is it I contact
all very good eye contact
yeah
okay well done yes eye contact that&#39;s
exactly what I know somebody missed a
spelling bee even there it&#39;s good so now
I contact any other ideas Oh such
instigation inspiration yes sir we do
want inspiration and you you will get
but it&#39;s not right
sorry sir information is wrong as well
yes here at the dumbest audience I&#39;ve
ever talked to
incise absolutely I don&#39;t know who said
it but insights yeah it&#39;s often mistaken
for information but information is not
all within theis Matta fact usually it&#39;s
not so yes insights in other words you
want to learn something you want to hear
something you&#39;ve never heard before a
fresh perspective yes and if you get
that you&#39;re happy inside yourself you go
oh yeah I think I can survive on the
planet a bit longer because I&#39;ve got
this insight yes and there&#39;s another
thing you want and it begins with E
how&#39;s that
she&#39;s doing it again that&#39;s a cheese is
a cheese no but II damn always see what
you mean eat em oh yeah Oh put me in my
place with her cheese related crack um
so so yeah it&#39;s naughty damn but
somebody said it what was it
entertainment yes we all want to be
entertained yes absolutely and then
there&#39;s a final one it&#39;s got two words
in it yeah oh this could take a while
it could take a while will we start at
the lower end of the yeah have a go then
then again I did say the lower end no
it&#39;s not a political party believe it or
not you&#39;re not hungry for politics
see you go oh look - you feel good
little feel-good Actos dude she should
be up here yeah feel good so what
happens when people create a talk is
they do this thing they say oh what&#39;s
the amazing insight I&#39;m going to impart
to this audience how am I going to look
super clever and at the same time I
changed the world make it a better place
and we focus a lot on this stuff and
that&#39;s good unfortunately quite often
it&#39;s information but this is the stuff
we tend to look for as an audience we
want this I encourage people to do a lot
more of this and a lot more of this
because guess what you people have
become very difficult yeah you&#39;re not as
compliant as you used to be he used to
sit down and listen but now you don&#39;t do
that anymore too many distractions
always my phone somebody could be
looking for me
could be life or death Facebook message
that&#39;s what you&#39;re like so that&#39;s why
your speakers we have to add this stuff
in what time the good old days when you
could just do this no you know thank you
very much
no but that&#39;s not enough a great speaker
great engager will do something with
these three things he or she will ask
themselves the question there go how
engaged do I want to make my audience
efore engage mint tea for time yes so
they&#39;ll say how engaged I want to make
my audience and then let&#39;s say hmm I&#39;ve
got 20 minutes or whatever it is let&#39;s
say right and then they&#39;ll plan it out
and they&#39;ll know they know this they&#39;ll
know that ooh when I walk out on stage
would there&#39;ll be a little bit of
interest because they&#39;ll be going oh
what&#39;s he about who does he think he is
where did you get those shoes all of
that stuff is going on ok so there&#39;s a
level of interest I got that and then
I&#39;ll do something like I&#39;ll start
telling a story and then BOOM oh that&#39;s
even more know if I came out and start a
tail 10 years ago I used to be a
comedian and then things went really
wrong because people stopped talking
back to me
that&#39;s how I could go but no I told the
story I took it up I said yeah let&#39;s
tell story and then what happened I got
into my story but even within seconds of
me getting into my store some I feel
highly distracted addicted to other
things people
some of you were already gone well
little story I know but I&#39;m losing
interest hmm
so then what did I have to do I&#39;ll tell
you what I did I said something about Oh
women surrounded by women did somebody
Oh
it&#39;s run by women cheese I find it hard
to believe this is fascinating
ah they&#39;re Nazis accent ah that&#39;s boring
I know like access uh please no no no
refrigerator to check of them and then
and then uh yeah what&#39;s in the
refrigerator and then this just went on
and on right okay so as an audience
member you had that little just an ebb
and flow continually now what I as a
Greece speaker that I aspire to be
what I love to do is I&#39;ll do like any
good speaker I&#39;ll try and identify what
that is do you know what that is time
good sir
thank you for sharing that what kind of
time it&#39;s a certain type of time sir
attention span Thank You C very good at
the front row
so yeah that&#39;s attention span in
stand-up comedy that&#39;s 20 seconds in a
business meeting it maybe maybe you got
two minutes depends on the context if
you&#39;re in doing a lecture and a theatre
where students can&#39;t get out the door
maybe you&#39;ve got a bit longer but
they&#39;ve drifted off I don&#39;t know so you
have to ask yourself what&#39;s a good
speaker that wants to engage people will
say what&#39;s actually their attention span
and that&#39;ll be dictated by the context
how interested they are in his subject
what they know about how they feel about
all those things and then there go well
it&#39;s two minutes
so that&#39;s beaker will then do this
they&#39;ll say I&#39;m gonna open with
something that&#39;s gonna grab them and
then every two minutes I&#39;m gonna get him
a little bit feel good or I&#39;m gonna give
them an insight what&#39;s the other thing
I&#39;m gonna give them entertainment oh my
god you are such fast learners seriously
I want all your names before you leave
yeah so my peoples
I am done here I feel my work is done I
feel like we all got a moment it was
amazing for me and hopefully for you so
the next time you&#39;re going to do a
little talk or speech think of these
things design engagement into it thank
you very much have a lovely night
[Applause]
