[Music]
and the how old were you when you first
started playing two and a half Wow
you know what I was doing I was two and
a half not that so anyway so I listened
to you when you were performing at our
rehearsal and you made it look easy but
I&#39;m sure it took you a lot of time and
effort to get to that point what is it
about music that makes all the hard work
worth it I really love music because
it&#39;s super nice to be in complete
control of something like when I&#39;m
playing it&#39;s just me and my ukulele it&#39;s
it&#39;s not anybody else making the magic
happen that&#39;s awesome
you also have an original song that
you&#39;ll be performing for us today what
is the message from your song that you
would like to get it that you would like
to get across the audience today well
when I set out to write a song I don&#39;t
really think about the message that I&#39;m
trying to send but but rather what notes
sound nice and then what word sounds
nice with with the notes you know that
works alright well there you have it em
I know you won&#39;t need it but good luck
I&#39;m a Harner everybody i watch the roses
bloom
[Music]
I
you
