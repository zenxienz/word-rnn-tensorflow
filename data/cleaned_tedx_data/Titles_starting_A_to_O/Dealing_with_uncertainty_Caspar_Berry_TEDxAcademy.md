Oh have you had a great day
birthday welcome to great cool
risk-taking and decision-making in this
new age of uncertainty with myself
casper berry in the next 15 minutes I
want to talk to you about uncertainty
what is it where does it come from what
causes it what are the effects on us all
as individuals as team members as
organizations what do we tend to do
about it
what&#39;s been our response for four and a
half thousand years since they erected
the Parthenon on the Acropolis and what
do I think we should do about it and
could do about it
what if playing poker for three years in
Las Vegas teach me about that thing
called uncertainty and it&#39;s close cousin
risk and how we can embrace them to
achieve our best self so what is
uncertainty allow your mind to one day
it&#39;s the unknown it&#39;s the unpredictable
I guess about 10 years ago 2007 we&#39;ve
probably thought of the world something
like that right it was confusing there
were decisions to make we didn&#39;t always
know what the right thing to do was
but now 2017 the world feels more like
that right now when we&#39;re trying to
figure out what to do the terrain has
changed look at what&#39;s happened we&#39;ve
had the financial crisis we&#39;ve had the
Arab Spring we&#39;ve had unpredictable
events right here in Greece
we&#39;ve got unpredictable events right now
in England
they&#39;ve got unpredictable events in
America I&#39;m sure it&#39;s gonna be fine
right they know what they&#39;re doing
I hope they know what they&#39;re doing but
here&#39;s the thing this is not new
definitive study on global
unpredictability was started a long time
ago
by a guy called Philip tetlock 30 years
ago 1984 he&#39;s a young academic at the
National Research Council he&#39;s working
in the cold war and he becomes
fascinated by how good or bad we are are
predicting the future so he embarks on a
study he starts asking 284 world
expert and because of his position there
world experts for their judgments their
guesses their assessments as to what the
future holds and it&#39;s quite a simple
structure I want to share it with you he
gives each of them just three potential
choices so he says for example is social
unrest in Russia
is there going to get better or worse or
remain about the same according to this
metric and these parameters and they
have to make their guess and accompany
it with a likelihood that measures their
degree of confidence in their guests so
they say it&#39;s going to get better
I&#39;ve studied this for 20 years I&#39;m 99%
sure or they might say oh I think it&#39;s
gonna be about the same but I don&#39;t know
I&#39;m about 40%
it&#39;s a massive study this is why I&#39;m
sharing it with you in total he asks
twenty seven thousand four hundred and
fifty questions over the course of 20
years takes him five years to write it
up it is literally his life&#39;s work and
because of the sheer size and scale of
it it&#39;s regarded as one of most robust
studies in all of social sciences so
what are the results well we&#39;re in the
data it&#39;s much variation some people
definitely better than others and we
will come back to that they&#39;re taken as
a whole as a whole those 284 world
experts over twenty seven thousand four
hundred and fifty guesses in twenty
years are no better than random you
would have got the same quality of
answers from asking a child so what is
this thing called uncertainty where does
it come from well in defense of those
experts the world is a really
complicated place right I mean maybe a
better word is complex the world&#39;s
complex place and to understand
complexity has got right to the heart of
that idea and think about the butterfly
effect now we know how the butterfly
effect is always explained they say that
a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil
can cause a rainstorm in Rome right
that&#39;s how its explained but that&#39;s not
really what it means what it means I&#39;m
sure you know is that tiny things can
have big impacts the tiniest of things
can have the biggest impact and effect
in poker I used to think about that all
the time the tiniest of thing a wink a
blink can change
that&#39;s why everyone&#39;s trying to cover up
their foot we have the phrase the
pokerface now they wear the cap and the
shades and that&#39;s legal in most poker
rooms that&#39;s going too far
alright folks we will see a nice fair
game but the point is the information is
limited we don&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s
going on under those shades or in that
soul but here&#39;s where the butterfly
effect is really really takes place in
poker in the center of all of those
tables is a randomly shuffled deck of
cards every single one of those cars
could completely change the hand and you
know what the amazing thing is every
hand in poker every evening in poker
your results will have more to do with
the length of the dealer&#39;s nails as they
shuffle the cards together than all of
your all of your great play and poker
and life are interacting these
butterflies flapping their wings all the
time changing everything this is
honestly true if the six of Hearts had
fallen on a particular hand of Poker in
Las Vegas in 2001 I would have won about
three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
now it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t fall but I often
wonder what would have happened if it
had I have no idea maybe I&#39;d have
stopped playing there and then poker was
supposed to be a life break for me I
thought six months ain&#39;t alep doing it
for three years maybe maybe not maybe
I&#39;d have carried on playing maybe I&#39;d
still be doing it now here&#39;s what
wouldn&#39;t have happened right if that had
fallen I wouldn&#39;t have stopped on the
exact day that I did ten months later I
wouldn&#39;t come back to England I wouldn&#39;t
have met this guy became business
partners we wouldn&#39;t have set up this
company we wouldn&#39;t have built it up to
a team of 40 we sold it to a PLC I
wouldn&#39;t have them moved to London and
started commentating on poker on TV I
wouldn&#39;t have been asked to be poker
advisor on the bond movie Casino Royale
I wouldn&#39;t have been asked to speak
about that I wouldn&#39;t be a speaker now
here today you&#39;d probably have someone
much better here&#39;s my point if you think
or do anything differently as a result
of this that six of hearts changed all
of our lives and that is happening every
single moment of every single day to all
of us
and that is how a poker player has to
think it&#39;s you you&#39;re applauding but
it&#39;s frustrating though right because if
that&#39;s happening then we&#39;re we&#39;re not in
control of our lives and that would have
an effect on us if you thought about the
world every day like that which I don&#39;t
want you to it takes away something you
need Maslow&#39;s pyramid of needs what does
he tell us down the bottom there
we need safety security it&#39;s down there
with our basic needs food water warmth
obviously Wi-Fi he&#39;s doing that pyramid
today right we need to feel in control
of our lives we need to feel a sense of
certainty that&#39;s why we don&#39;t think of
the world as that chaotic most of the
time look at the look at the society the
world that we&#39;ve created in those four
and a half thousand years what do we do
soon as we could we project produce laws
which you know impose a certain amount
of control and I&#39;m glad we did I want to
feel safe as I walk down the street
capitalism has process and procedure we
have the health and safety world to try
and eliminate risk and thank God we do
save hundreds of thousands of lives in
the last hundred years how when you
think about it by catching butterflies
by putting up signs stopping people from
doing silly things everything is banned
in this location I have no idea where it
is leaning against a wall carrying a
violin this is an actual sign from a
Japanese toilet a lot of the things down
the bottom there I&#39;ve never tried I
don&#39;t know that has tried we can try and
stop people from doing these silly
things but we&#39;ll never stop everything
right we&#39;ll never go all the way we&#39;ll
never catch every butterfly you know why
because the butterfly effect if you have
to visually represent it doesn&#39;t look
like that you can&#39;t but if you had to
have to it would look more like that
it&#39;s a million a billion and maybe an
infinite number and that&#39;s important of
different agents of chance and change
all interacting with each other in ways
that I want to go so far as to say we in
our lifetimes will never be able to
fully predict and that&#39;s frustrating
that&#39;s why it&#39;s really comforting when
someone else comes along who seems to be
able to do that right the early belief
systems were based on that promise we
had a hotline literally here to the gods
and we still invest hundreds of billions
of dollars every single day week month
year on the basis of these kind of
predictions this is the Bank of England
actual prediction as to what the UK
economy would look like in 2008 from
their perspective at the time a 2004 and
I think we can all agree there&#39;s some
margin for error isn&#39;t there there huh
little bit of wiggle room they&#39;ve given
themselves at the Bank of England this
is a very clever way of going I don&#39;t
know that&#39;s basically what they&#39;re
they&#39;re saying they&#39;re actually I&#39;m
having some fun at the Bank of England&#39;s
expense they&#39;re doing something very
important here in that fan that spread
they&#39;re actually saying we can&#39;t tell
you exactly what the future holds we&#39;re
going to make a good guess but actually
it turns out this power in that because
whilst taken as a whole those experts
predictions no better than random some
people were better than others and tell
it was a scientist he wanted to try and
understand that he wanted to try and
correlate their success against
something else in his data because if he
could do that he would have identified
maybe the cause or a correlation of good
judgment wasn&#39;t easy didn&#39;t correlate
against their academic discipline or
their age or their experience or their
political persuasion left or right the
single strongest correlation that he
could find within the data was between
their success and the confidence that
they had in their guests remember on 99
percent I&#39;m dead certain I&#39;m forty
percent I don&#39;t really know and the
correlation was negative that is the
less sure they were the more likely they
were to be right feels counterintuitive
at first but it&#39;s not reframe the 99
percenters were kind of going trust me
I&#39;m an expert it&#39;s going to be this the
40% is were kind of going I&#39;m also an
expert studied this 20 years been wrong
in the past this person an expert we
disagree really important for me to try
and understand where they&#39;re coming from
these people were humble they were
open-minded they all
craved new data and information more
than anything else what I would say is
these people embraced the reality of
uncertainty they didn&#39;t dismiss it as
something which happens every now and
again in other words we can have a
choice we can view the world like this
as being you know quite uncertain
although there&#39;s always a right answer
right that&#39;s what we were trained to
look for since the age of five our right
answer or we can accept that there is no
right answer it&#39;s not sitting out there
waiting to be discovered by an expert
it&#39;s always being shaped that is the
reality of uncertainty the world doesn&#39;t
look like that now it&#39;s always look like
that and if you want to come with me on
that journey if we think that that is
what the world looks like and that&#39;s how
we&#39;re going to more accurately think
about the future then this person has
something to teach us not because
they&#39;re any wiser than us or more
intelligent but because in poker you
wouldn&#39;t just be one of those arrogant
experts to say I know what the future
holds
you&#39;d be slightly mad because the last
cards going to come down the ace of
hearts or the five of spades and it&#39;s
going to totally change the outcome of
your decision your investment decision
your resource allocation decision so we
need a way of just accepting and
embracing the reality of uncertainty
when we make those decisions and here&#39;s
the amazing thing it never fails to
amaze me we have won we&#39;ve had it for
300 years it literally makes insurance
possible credit possible valuation of
anything under uncertainty possible it
underpins capitalism itself and yet when
I show it to you now it&#39;s always always
always counterintuitive here&#39;s what we
do we say okay there&#39;s four thousand
dollars in the pot that&#39;s the upside and
everything you&#39;ve ever done in your
lives has an upside let&#39;s imagine we
have to put in $400 to cool that&#39;s our
investment that&#39;s the cost that&#39;s the
risk that&#39;s what&#39;s at stake what we&#39;re
going to do now in an uncertain world is
what we all do every day but
subconsciously we&#39;re going to make a
judgment and assessment and in a world
of uncertainty all judgments all
assessments are actually probability
assessments
so we say okay I think I&#39;ve got about
25% chance I&#39;m not definitely gonna win
I&#39;m not definitely going to lose that
allows us to do a calculation the origin
of the phrase calculated risk and it
looks like this
if 25% of the time we win $4,000 that
means each time on average we win 1,000
we never win 1,000 we are the win 4000
or lose 400 but on average that&#39;s our
long-term upside if 75% of the time we
lose 400 then each time on average we
lose 75% of 400 which is 300 that means
we can now add those two together our
long-term upside - our long-term
downside to get a value an average value
of this situation will never make $700
but on average that&#39;s what this is worth
it means three amazing things number one
it means at a poker game if we don&#39;t
make that call if we fold our cards
because we could lose we&#39;re turning down
$700 we&#39;re literally passing it up value
we have to make that call
it&#39;s a great call number two it is great
irrespective of whether it succeeds on
this occasion or not that&#39;s mind blowing
decision-making science tells us that a
decision is good or bad irrespective of
this outcome we don&#39;t live our lives
like that at all and number three if we
divide it by our investment we get a
return on our investment of 175 percent
in business we kill for that kind of
return in poker we don&#39;t have to kill we
just have to be prepared to fail that&#39;s
what happens in an uncertain world you
fail more but it&#39;s fine don&#39;t worry
because we think long-term this is Doyle
Brunson probably the greatest poker
player of all time
he&#39;s now worth tens of millions of
dollars but in order to get there he had
to be prepared to fail and a hand and an
evening in a week even in a month to
make those millions he&#39;s had to lose
more money than most of us will see
during the course of a lifetime but he&#39;s
still smiling and that&#39;s why now that&#39;s
how I why is because he&#39;s got millions
the losses
short-term it&#39;s all about the end the
destination do you know Babe Ruth he had
the all-time record for the most number
of home runs hit do you know he also had
the all-time record for the most number
of strikeouts for complete misses of the
ball that means by two different metrics
he&#39;s both the best and the worst player
of all time
I put it to you that&#39;s not a coincidence
that sometimes if you want to be the
best over here you have to accept a
negative metric how can he do this
no don&#39;t turn your business model on
your head you don&#39;t have to set up a
whole new company here&#39;s an amazing
thing Warren Bennis professor of
leadership at Harvard University did a
study of the great super leaders the
Bill Gates the Bill Clinton&#39;s he found
out that those people they got let down
lie too and screwed over more often than
most of us why is that surely these were
the people that others wanted to follow
well maybe maybe if you trust a hundred
people maybe twenty of them will let you
down but maybe you get more from the
other eighty than if you don&#39;t trust any
of them at all
maybe we should be taking more risks
like that and our lives we can immunize
ourselves to this pain if we want to but
we won&#39;t get all the benefit of this
surely the stories that we tell about
the great leaders in the world surely
they are the stories of the times that
they failed and we don&#39;t tell those just
because they make good stories or
because they&#39;re more incompetent we tell
them because you bite off more than
anybody else and you do fail more often
this guy failed in business in 1831
defeated four legislature 1830 to second
business failure 1833 nois break down
1836 confined to bed for six months but
he gets up and he&#39;s defeated for speaker
in 1838 defeated for Congress 1848
defeated with Senate 1855 give it up now
Abe maybe it&#39;s not for you know defeat
of a vice president 1856 defeated his
Senate again 1858 before finally being
elected president in 1860 and that is
what we remember him for
the long-term achievement thank you
he was assassinated age 65 or over
which does show bridge taking is
dangerous be careful thank you
[Applause]
