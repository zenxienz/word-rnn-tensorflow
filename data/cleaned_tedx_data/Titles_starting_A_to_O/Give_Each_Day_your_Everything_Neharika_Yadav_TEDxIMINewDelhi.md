I&#39;m dr. Nahar cadaver dental surgeon by
profession I run my private dental
clinic and gorga six days a week and on
the seventh day I&#39;m at both
international circuit as a superbike
racer to share my journey with all of
you which started off four years ago I
had gone for a biking event with a
friend of mine and looking at these
thousand sea sea monsters revving past
me was a fulfillment and a dream that
I&#39;d never felt before that day there was
a passion that ignited inside of me I&#39;ve
never felt this way the excitement
inside of me was something I can never
even explain and that day I had made up
my mind to go back to the track and ride
a lot of people told me that it&#39;s going
to be extremely challenging it&#39;s a
dangerous sport it&#39;s life-threatening
and the outcome in case of any fatality
was very very serious but I had already
made up my mind with a strong team of a
fighter pilot father released mom and an
adventurous sister we were of strong
support system so my practice started I
picked up a smaller bike which was the
KTM rc390 and what are some you know
loose baggy leathers from some bikers
and the reason I&#39;m saying smaller is
because now I write at 899 65 so yes so
that&#39;s how my journey started and with
my baggy leathers and my KTM rc390 I
went onto the track to ride amongst all
the professional racers there were times
when there were a lot of obstacles a lot
of challenges because you know with them
writing on thousand cc bikes crossing me
at almost 300 kilometres per hour it was
quite a challenge because on most
I was scared that somebody would
probably come and ram into me or even
the fear of me falling off especially
considering I have only 50% moment in my
right hand
after a very serious road accident but I
put all these obstacles behind me and
also thanks to the wonderful riders male
riders at the track who have always
supported me and helped me to perform
even better
so um post this journey I went on to
participate in the jacket.i Superbike
Championship 2015 and 16 as the only
female racer out of as many as 40 male
racers and while I was racing nobody
knew there was a lady amongst those men
so when I came back to the pit after my
dress and I took off my helmet the
audience stood up and started clapping
they were shot and the best said wise my
mother could give me was beta
please go slow I was really surprised
you know I don&#39;t think any of you saw
has ever been given this advice before
there is please right slow so my mother
explains the the writing part and the
racing has flying dots so you can
understand the speeds that we touch with
my speed being 275 km/h a lot of people
message me from around the globe because
they say they inspired and they
motivated but it&#39;s not because I am a
lady who rides bikes they are inspired
by Annie because I juggle my profession
of being a dental surgeon where we
practice in fractions of millimeters and
then I go on to a profession which is
completely diverse completely dynamic
and riding at 275 kilometres per hour
and often I keep getting asked that how
do you balance these two so for me it&#39;s
very simple when I&#39;m in clinic and I&#39;m
treating my patients in my clinic I
don&#39;t think of my biking or my racing
and when I&#39;m back on track my clinic
does not even exist that&#39;s how I balance
it out the other way for me to balance
out my profession and my passion is I
have always believed that each one of us
has a inner core
and an exterior or an outer core your
inner core is your inner world is your
inner self it is the world that you only
you have access to where you put your
family your close friends your passion
and your outer world is the people
around you you know your environment
outside you what people say the jealousy
the insecurities factors and all of that
and a lot of times I have kept my
professional so in my outer world on my
outer core because when you bring it
into your inner self I&#39;m sure each one
of you must have gone through it
somewhere you bring your work back home
you bring up tensions back home so it&#39;s
very important to know the difference
between your inner core and your outer
core and to balance the two out when all
in this rat race but here&#39;s the news
there is no destination we&#39;re going no
way none of us so it&#39;s extremely
important for each one of us to enjoy
the journey each day as it comes to give
life the best and as we live this
journey it is what I the rules that I
live by the values I live by is each day
to encourage a mind inspire a soul and
to give each day my everything thank you
so much
