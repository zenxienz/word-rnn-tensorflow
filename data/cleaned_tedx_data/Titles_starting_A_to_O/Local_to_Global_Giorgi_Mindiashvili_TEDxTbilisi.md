I have a question to you what is going
to be like the future of hospitality
it&#39;s a very general question isn&#39;t it so
I will try to answer that together with
you today global hospitality breads
massively franchised companies companies
that are rolled all across the globe
logos that every child knows the
visionaries of these hospitality breads
they&#39;ve done an amazing job what they
did is that they&#39;ve actually created the
breads that are well known all across
the globe they&#39;ve managed to roll these
breads from the top central locations to
the most remote destinations what
they&#39;ve also did is that they&#39;ve taught
us industry professionals the guests and
the customers what actually the
standards are so now we anticipate the
standards now we know what the quality
is now we have expectations from the
brands from the standards from service
let&#39;s analyze this more deeply
consistent guestrooms standard food
recipes the same menus the same lobbies
the brand standards that deliver the
same interior exterior architecture
guest experiences same stories that are
told from one continent to another same
goodbye and same good old have a nice
day the brand standards that have been
strengthened developed and delivered
over a century it&#39;s boring
it&#39;s not exciting anymore
it has worn out it&#39;s totally not up to
date so let me tell you what I believe
to be the future of this amazing
industry let me tell you what I believe
to be the driver for the change and it
all starts with the new amazing
generation of Millennials it&#39;s them it&#39;s
not as the industry professionals who
have changed their vision this one US
who delivered new global brand or trends
it&#39;s actually them what they did is that
they actually delivered a total new
global brand and let me tell you about
this global brand it translates into
feel quite a few very good things such
as originality authenticity
individuality character design inform
where you&#39;re thinking and urbanity
neighborhoods surroundings art cultural
connections a variety of flavors crafts
storytelling honesty transparency and an
amazing element of fun which is so
important isn&#39;t it let me tell you about
luxury luxury has been part of the
hospitality always pretty much people
refer to luxury when they talk about
hospitality
so what luxury is in simple words now
luxury in simple wars is good life isn&#39;t
it the concept of luxury has been
dramatically changing nowadays the old
luxury was all about wealth and
expensive materials the new luxury is
all about meaningful experiences now
let&#39;s take all this step back and think
again the new brand that has been born
these brand is easy to get connected
with
it&#39;s emotionally engaging it delivers
equally the feeling to be in touch with
local surroundings at the same time to
be part of the global growth and
development
now the intrapreneurs and creative
industry professionals what they&#39;ve done
is that they&#39;ve started to mutually
gravitate towards these trends they all
see you all see them here they&#39;re all
here and there&#39;s certainly no conspiracy
theory behind this because in some of
the cases actually most of the cases
these particular intrapreneurs they
don&#39;t even know each other they come
from different backgrounds different you
know cultural inspirations different
locations but what happens is that they
base their businesses they base their
lifestyle businesses on the same trends
that excites Millennials that&#39;s exactly
what they do now let&#39;s have a look at
the work cycle of a modern human being
now we can&#39;t really analyze hospitality
without this particular segment because
it&#39;s very very important and the work
cycle of a modern human being has
absolutely changed offices like these
are not exciting anymore
offices like these to not drive anymore
the creativity and creativity has become
the fuel the major field now for growth
development and general well-being and
as more we emerge in future more and
more professionals will probably switch
to places like this all the
forward-thinking companies know that
creative spaces deliver better work
results so let&#39;s have a look what
happened with the hotels the classic
lobbies that we all remember have
changed the new lifestyle hotels are
delivering exciting living spaces
instead of the lobbies these places
encourage creativity when you walk in
any of these places you actually in
instantly feel the vibes and these vibes
are carried all across the building it&#39;s
very hard to not notice not to feel them
actually you walk to the neutral and
dark you know corridors and hallways of
the past and they have totally changed
you see that there are interesting
interactive exhibitions from the local
artists now how would you deliver all
this how would you actually make the
change I believe that in order to make
the change you have to stay local to
some extent I also believe that when you
stay local people get connected easily
the engagement is very high and
hospitality is about engagement how we
engage others in our own stories local
brands have very strong messages to stay
local does not mean to stay small you
can actually be local and you can
actually have very strong messages and
grow your brand globally so how would
you do that actually it is possible to
do it and I will tell you how at least
what I believe in so in order to do that
there are loads of tools out there
available its 21st century 25 years ago
30 years ago those tools were not
available now they&#39;re very easy to get
them it&#39;s very easy to get trained it&#39;s
very easy to get connected with these
tools they bring your business to the
global scale and then what you need then
is your multidisciplinary teams who are
spirited and who believe in your own
stories now the major high street brands
as we call them they definitely have
this base out there because they drive
the economy they tell their own stories
which we know them they built industry
professionals and also what they do they
deliver the quality and the quality is
consistent it&#39;s very much needed at the
same time they cope with the volumes I
don&#39;t think that lifestyle businesses
could cope with the volumes quite right
now but here&#39;s the question
do they drive a change do they actually
drive the future where do we picture
ourselves do we want young creative
Millennials to come and explore our
cities and come and explore our
neighborhoods do we want our own stories
to be told globally because what we
create is actually who we attract that&#39;s
fact so I would say investing local
brands tell your own stories make local
go global thank you
you
