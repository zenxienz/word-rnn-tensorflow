I have a dream for small cities for I
believe that small cities are wonderful
and inspiring places to live today I&#39;m
going to talk a little bit about my
experience in the areas of economic
development and planning I want to talk
a little bit about some of my thoughts
and observations and some of the
development trends that have shaped
development within our United States
obviously the first trend is
suburbanization suburbanization in its
simplest form is just simply the
movement of people away from a
community&#39;s core you began sort of after
World War Two to very real degrees that
is still going on today
however it is being placed what with
something that I think is much more
dynamic and that is the concept of place
making place making is the innovative
and design of public and private spaces
these public and private spaces are
shared and around these public and
private spaces new development is
created it has an emphasis on downtown&#39;s
neighborhoods and community image but
what is very significant about this
process and what is important about the
places that that we lived is that where
we live shapes who we become it shapes
the mind of our children and and it
directs future development next for
today&#39;s purpose I want to talk a little
bit about and kind of understand what is
a small city the US Census Bureau
defines urbanized places as any place
that has 50,000 persons with the density
of at least 1,000 persons per square
mile given that there are 500 urbanized
places in
United States for my purposes today I
consider a small city a place that has
an urbanized population of less than
200,000 persons given that and given
that the fact that Florence South
Carolina has an urbanized population of
90,000 then we really fit very well into
that definition but also what&#39;s
important to consider is that there are
320 urbanized spaces that are a similar
size similar interest and compete with
us for jobs economic development
opportunities and for a community image
now I want us to kind of follow along
with a few premises our concepts and I
want you to think about these as I kind
of move forward through the rest of my
discussion first I want us to take the
position or try to understand and
certainly I think we do that where we
choose to live is one of the most
important decisions that we will ever
make there are very many variables to
that decision but that decision is
extremely important because that
decisions shapes how we feel about where
we live and who we become it influences
us greatly
and how we deal with the people around
us second I want you to think about why
cities and this is relatively simple but
certainly cities are the Centers of
Commerce they are often the seat of
government and with their collective
population in an economic wealth that
cities influence the arts the culture
there therefore they influence society
and heÂ´ll and how well they do that is
really dependent on how well they do
that and we&#39;ll talk about that a little
bit later so let&#39;s think about why
cities in what makes cities great places
to be and particularly as it relates to
small cities
for small cities in comparison to large
cities typically are very personal we
kind of go through life we are it is
very easy for us that come from small
cities to recognize that kind of
remember that that football game against
a crosstown arrival it is not unusual
for us to kind of experience one mall
our other type social venue we played in
recreational sports with friends and
acquaintances from other neighborhoods
and other schools therefore small cities
tend to be very personal
they have a rich shared experience but
also and it is very reasonable to
consider this that small cities can also
feel confining they sometimes might be
limiting and it&#39;s not all it is fairly
common for a mentor a family member a
teacher to say if you are going to gain
knowledge if you&#39;re going to experience
the world then you have to leave the
place that you grew up to experience and
learn and enjoy that experience some of
that is certainly true but is but it is
not necessarily the concept that I that
I take hold of because I believe with
the right set of circumstances the right
kind of leadership the right kind of
resources being put forward that small
cities can be truly distinctive and
interesting and fun places to live it is
a challenge though for us to be able to
achieve that and I would imagine that if
I took individuals from this room and we
went to a table in another and another
part of this building that we could sit
around that table and in in a relatively
short period of time we could come up
with the features that make for great
places to live and if we did that
I believe that list
would look very similar to this features
that make for great places to live that
that character and image is important
that is that the form and type of
development is attractive and appealing
that our parks and green spaces are
connected to our neighborhoods that our
neighborhoods are connected to to the
larger community and those are integral
parts of who we are and how we relate to
ourselves and what end the place that we
live that entertainment is available
it&#39;s varied it&#39;s interesting we have
movie theaters we have breweries we have
good places to go interesting
restaurants and that entertainment is
designed for both young and old that
diversity is a part of who we are
whether it&#39;s in the arts or in culture
whether it&#39;s in people or whether it&#39;s
in the concept of ideas there that
public safety that we feel and are safe
in the various spaces that we live and
go that we would have a strong economy
that that economy would produce living
wages that those that those jobs would
be interesting and they would keep us
here and our children here we would have
access to public health and that access
to public health good hospitals would be
affordable we would be socially engaged
not unlike today we&#39;d be socially
engaged in community and family that we
would have a distinctive City that where
we go who we speak to if we&#39;re in
another part of part of the state or the
country and we say we are from south of
Florence South Carolina that we have a
sense of pride and many people know who
we are and that they have been here and
seen our seen our community and we just
have a sense of goodness about that that
feeling that we have a healthy downtown
sustainable growing
because downtown&#39;s give us identity we
have strong neighborhoods affordable
housing we have interesting retail and
things to do and our community is clean
efficient and we&#39;re proud of that aspect
now given that it is relatively simple
for us to kind of say hey these are the
things that that we want because we&#39;ve
experienced them we&#39;ve read about them
we have witnessed them in some way shape
or form but the real struggle is not
imagining what we want not imagining
what our dream is or what we desire but
being able to to be in the position to
create it and that is the real crutch of
the problem and the challenge and the
dream for our city Florence South
Carolina a short while ago I read an
article written by James fallow who
writes for the Atlantic magazine he he
had traveled around the country and he
only visited cities that were successful
and and in that in those interviews and
observations he very concisely described
why some cities are successful and
others are not I&#39;m going to kind of go
through that list and in just a moment
but obviously there are other people who
have done done that as well but it is
this challenge that is so critical to
our success traits that produce a place
that inspires a place that we want to
live that we want our children to grow
in we do not immerse ourselves in
national politics the diverse nature of
national politics what we do is we find
practical solutions to local problems we
have a shared vision that vision can be
articulated by our community leaders
we have true community leaders and
committed citizens and it&#39;s not really
so important that they be somebody from
a captain of industry or somebody from
government what&#39;s important is that we
have them and we know who they are and
that these individuals are committed for
the good of our community in ways that
kind of the ways that are different than
just about private investment we use
incentives to move forward the public
interest incentives create Economic
Opportunity incentives drive
redevelopment in our neighborhoods and
our downtown&#39;s but they are always
applied appropriately and they&#39;re always
applied in a manner that moves the
public will the public interest in a
positive and appropriate way that we
have reasonable regulations that those
rate regulations cause good development
that those regulations protect the
environment that we have true
public/private partnerships that is the
city working with the county the city
working with the state the city working
with a foundation and that those
individuals are collaborative and they
produce real results we have an exciting
sustainable downtown a downtown is is
kind of an interesting concept but the
downtown brings identity and Association
to a community we have school systems
that are engaged but more importantly
our school system has to teach our young
people the skills that they need for a
rapidly changing job market they&#39;ve got
to be dynamic they should be unusual and
they should be challenging diversity and
the concept of diversity is welcome we
share ideas we have all kinds of
interesting and fun things
to do for the worst calls to a community
is the loss of young people to other
places because we are not inclusive are
an interesting place to live and finally
I think one of the most incredibly
important tools and it&#39;s very similar to
sort of the real estate maxium of
location Location Location you have got
to co-op cooperate cooperate cooperate
these traits are my dream for our
community Florence South Carolina has
come a long way in a very short period
of time it has it has taken a lot of
people working very long hours with a
vision to cause that to happen but we
still have a very long way way to go and
that is my dream my dream is to work in
a place where people set aside partisan
politics they know when they need to
check their a ego and we move forward
our community and a positive and real
way that is my dream thank you
you
