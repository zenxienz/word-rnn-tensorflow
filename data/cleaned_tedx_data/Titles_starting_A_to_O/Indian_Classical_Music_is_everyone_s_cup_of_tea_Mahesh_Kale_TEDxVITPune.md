so whether you are a doctor in Italy or
anywhere in Europe or you&#39;re a farmer in
a remote village in India or a IT
professional in the Silicon Valley or a
social worker in Autopia
we all smile when we are happy we cry
when we are sad
Veon when we are sleepy and we jump when
we are excited don&#39;t we I think the
expression of our most intimate emotions
is universal and all of us across the
world despite our geography our language
and our culture are more similar than we
actually acknowledge the music forms a
bridge between this abstract emotion and
the spoken word and the abstract quality
of Indian classical music is what lends
itself to express this sub crystalline
thought very importantly and hence I
believe in and enjoy
I know of you of you might have a doubt
about what I&#39;m saying right now but I
want you to think of the first sign when
you were trying to ride a bicycle
a beautiful one I will shine right
bicycle I was completely hopeless but
with this movie will that give them a
ride a bike
did you feel the same way my brother was
helping me and I was waiting and falling
off it&#39;s coming from easy to everyone
else if you look at the scientific
explanation it&#39;s really simple as long
as you keep the center of gravity alive
and you keep on writing you will find
your balance but the scientific
explanation doesn&#39;t help you better
actually try to learn what helps you is
that these things to develop an instinct
to be able to ride the bike and I think
in a very similar way you have to
develop an instinct for Indian classical
music and if you do I believe every way
then enjoy your class giving I would
share an example I was actually wearing
the not has been part of the United
States about the detail ago and I was in
this town Livingston Montana was about
the performances go to open it there was
a mutual amusement between the audience
and the artist which was me I&#39;ll tell
you why because the audience was like
why is he sitting cross-legged
yoga side on the floor and I don&#39;t think
why are there any stretch big cowboy
hats and boots so it was predominantly a
white audience and I knew I was up for a
challenge
away ask them who has listened to in the
classical music before clearly nobody
had been asked another question a show
of hands on Westland or listen to jazz
music almost all hands make up then I
try to draw families between jazz music
and Indian classical music and just give
them a quick elect then one what is to
be seen and what is it provided is
enough they provide listen how do you go
back to the refill I explained to them
the scale and the meter and I was going
to sing it and within 20 minutes of my
presentation they started getting a
sense for a hang of what was happening
and every time I was going back to the
defendant Papa so I think and actually
at the end of it before the last piece I
mentioned that in classical music every
time you do a constantly pick different
scales a meter so I encourage you to all
come tomorrow for my concert with me or
not about 50 to 60 percent of them came
back again and it was another spoonful
so if someone that has no clue after to
us is able to enjoy and connect with
Indian classical music I believe
everyone can
classical music I think I want to do a
little social experiment to prove this
again and for that I would love a few
more it is same with me how about all of
you does that work have a show of hands
please can I
music is a response item one
and say
say afternoon and gonna start falling
with you
and enemies exactly so after
[Music]
Nizar
so how many of you
combination on stage
but
[Music]
[Applause]

what
he
[Music]
in love
I need
Levi
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
ah
ah
[Applause]
you have performed Rakesh but I think
within those few minutes you all were
able to develop an instinct for it
did you enjoy it
yeah and I think everyone can enjoy it
in classic music and as a kind of you
know I think that if you can write like
chickens to it if you can enjoy a
beautiful sunset or if you can enjoy the
sound of waves or an animal of a
beautiful rose I think you can enjoy the
activity because it is the response of n
peoples you just need to hone it and
hence I think in the classical music is
everyone&#39;s cup of tea or coffee
[Applause]
