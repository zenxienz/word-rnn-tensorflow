hopefully we&#39;ll manage to talk about
this topic together in an interesting
way so as these two quotes in the
straight the knowledge society discourse
has been around for quite some time now
and today it&#39;s still going strong
scientific research is considered key to
achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals and universities are seen to
contribute significantly to the
development of countries through higher
education and research and higher
education and research can in turn
contribute to local and global problem
solving independent problem solving so
we do have a lot of knowledge in the
world but it&#39;s not distributed equally
the light is not shining as strongly
everywhere so this is the topic that I
study in my research and also try to
learn from in my other job coordinating
collaborations with with African
universities so this map is meant to
illustrate the unequal distribution of
knowledge resources in the world it is a
bit old and it&#39;s based on the number of
scientific papers in Natural Sciences
engineering and technology that have
been published where the researchers
live and so you can see where the least
amount of research is is produced and
though things have changed there&#39;s still
quite a bit of inequality and also this
is not the only way to measure
scientific capacity of course there are
other fields of research there are other
types of publications as well as other
kinds of university capacity indicators
and outputs and like I said things are
changing and things are getting better
in that sense the number of both public
and private universities are growing
it&#39;s growing a lot and the
man for higher education is increasing
in increasing in a massive manner also
creating some quality assurance problems
but there are at least university&#39;s
growing order to meet this demand and so
more people are being able to get higher
education more money is being invested
in research globally even though
economic growth not necessarily
following the same curve countries are
choosing to spend money on research to a
higher degree and in in the face of this
picture that is a very good thing also
the number of scientists is increasing
and they are more mobile so they&#39;re
interacting more globally gender
equality in science is also improving
slowly but surely publications worldwide
have increased by 20% in the last ten
years and the collaboration between the
so-called north and the so-called south
and between the south and the South are
also increasing and challenges related
to climate change and the sustainable
development goals seem to be supporting
this increased collaboration so we are
realizing that we have a lot of problems
in common and we&#39;re working more
together to solve them that&#39;s my
conclusion from these trends so the good
news is that the so-called north/south
divide in research is actually
diminishing but there&#39;s still
significant inequalities and is
depending on where you look in the world
and plenty to work on in other words and
so there are many different actors
working on improving the state of
universities in the world as you can
probably imagine these different actors
are doing it for various different
reasons and in with different methods
but still there&#39;s a large network and
this is not all of them of course and a
few examples of them are on this slide
so what I will focus on today in this is
aid to universities in low-income
countries sometimes called science aid
or research aid so the focus is on the
the Swedish research aid actor Sarek or
later sido Sorek which along with
canada&#39;s IDRC were pioneers in providing
aid to universities in low-income
countries and supporting development
research they both started doing this
kind of work in the 70s and have been
doing this since and other donors have
been adding to the group working on this
area but sida and Sarek remain for
Masaryk remains pioneers so I dedicated
both my masters and my PhD to studying
Swedish research aid so it&#39;s fair to say
I&#39;m a bit of a nerd in this area but
today I want wade through the empirical
and theoretical complexities as much as
I would like I will just try to explain
briefly what research aid is and what
some of the success factors and risks
are seen to be with this practice ok so
what can research aid consists of many
different activities that can be both
can both have a capacity-building effect
in other words creating the
preconditions for sustainable research
infrastructure and in capacity and also
development research with the focus on
results that can be applied to
development problems in those countries
so one important activity is to support
research in low-income country
universities often in collaboration with
the so called donor country universities
also it could be it could be in areas
like mathematics environments with
science Health Sciences agriculture
basically the idea is that the
prioritized areas are supposed to be set
by the the low income country and the
actor
they&#39;re also there could be support to
research conducted in international
organizations that have more
concentrated capacity on certain areas
like health and agriculture for example
and the idea is that they produce
results that are universally valid in
some sense and this has received some
critique because not all research that
is universal is actually universal you
have to have this local adaptation but
still there are lots of different
results that come to use in many
countries that are done in regional
organizations international
organizations university to university
collaboration that focuses on building
training programs for masters in PhD so
assisting in building up this capacity
strengthening this capacity to for
training masters and PhD students and
this can be carried out in the
low-income country the high-income
country or both preferably in both or in
the low-income country it&#39;s not that one
that one example is the sandwich
programs for PhD where where PhD
students may have supervisors in their
home country as well as in the donor
country for example also support to
National Research Council&#39;s in order to
strengthen the the local systems for
financing of research for sustainable
for for sustainability in the future
infrastructure support this is a
sometimes forgotten part of research
capacity in order to have a functioning
higher education and research system you
need ICT administrative systems and so
on laboratories and so on so this can
also be built into so-called bilateral
cooperation and then also support to
research networks so research tent
research is very network dependent as it
is but if research has scarce resources
in certain areas then you can learn from
each other and pool resources and in
that way strengthen certain subjects in
in regions so for example in periods of
repressive governance governments in
Latin America for example in the 70s and
80s
social science critical social sciences
received support as a way to keep that
democratic perspective alive in in
research aid support okay and so what is
the verdict on research aid is it good
or should we collaborate in some other
way and so many studies have concluded
that it is a good form of aid it&#39;s
considered less politicized and it&#39;s
seen as a universal like a science is a
universal language with similar goals
and norms so it&#39;s it&#39;s a good way to
support development according to these
studies but the success depends on the
level of relevance that is achieved
through close connection to the
priorities of low-income countries and
establishing the the priorities that
represent this low-income country can
sometimes sometimes be very difficult
whose interests come into this agenda
setting and so on and sometimes it has
been donor driven sometimes it&#39;s been
driven by the university sometimes the
government&#39;s also it&#39;s a it can be
difficult and coordination amongst
development agencies is considered
essential in order to avoid so-called
donor overload because there may be many
donors working to support universities
in Tanzania for example or another
country and a lot of time can be spent
by the university in question to try to
see what kind of strategies the
different donors have and and so on and
making the priorities based on on this
so avoiding donor overload is a success
factor and then also support to entire
institutions rather than supporting
separate subjects or certain departments
is preferable so that the whole
universities can can
benefit support both basic research and
applied research is important they are
interdependent sometimes there&#39;s a
popular trend now it&#39;s all has to be
applied research because the quick
results and and so on but basic sciences
are required in order to have
sustainable structures to to be able to
develop applied research in that context
with time so that&#39;s that&#39;s another
success factor to not forget both areas
and the biggest problem are the
inequalities that perhaps not
surprisingly since that&#39;s part of the
problem that&#39;s trying to be solved so
it&#39;s ironic but not surprising there
needs to be a two-way street with mutual
interest learning and respect so who
sets the agenda when you&#39;re starting a
collaboration between the University and
a low-income country and a university in
a high-income country who has control
over defining the problems and finding
the solutions who has the budget control
documentation and reporting also unequal
preconditions in terms of researchers
salaries we have quite different
preconditions between high income
countries and low income countries
access to funding access to time what is
demanded of us as researchers in the
different context allows us to engage in
research or education or management in
different ways and an accident access to
time is an important factor that can
create unequal relations and not allow
time to spend on the research access to
infrastructure like I mentioned before
equipment books or or other other
infrastructure so I would just I&#39;m
starting to wind down here but in the
past Swedish research bills have
encouraged research collaboration with
low-income countries but mainly financed
by foreign aid and not as clearly based
on mutual interest as regular research
funding
whereas the research on this area shows
that mutual interest is important in
order to create equal and sustainable
relationships and collaborations so it&#39;s
positive that the developments today are
supporting that direction so this is
been changing in the recent research
bill underscores global engagement and
more research funding calls are now
including low-income countries more as
potential collaborators so the interest
from Swedish universities seems to be
increasing to collaborate with with
low-income countries and not just other
high-income countries or middle-income
countries so I just want to end by
encouraging you to think and learn about
how knowledge resources are spread
around the world or not and we are all
very different in in what we&#39;re working
on or doing in our lives but perhaps
many of us already do some things
related to for example the sustainable
development goals can we make new
connections in order to contribute to a
more inclusive knowledge society can we
reach out to new collaborating partners
different actors that we use
collaborating with being a little more
innovative in our approach
