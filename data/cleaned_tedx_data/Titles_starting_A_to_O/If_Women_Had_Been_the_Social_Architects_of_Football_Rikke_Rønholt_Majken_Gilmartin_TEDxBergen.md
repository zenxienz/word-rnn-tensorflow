so in March we hosted a third over those
woke up in Nairobi 28 women&#39;s teams from
24 different kind of countries have
qualified to the first African regional
tournament some the cheap moving the
goalposts they want in their OB this was
eight women who had done 24 actions for
the sustainable development goals before
we even saw that silence of the football
fields and the goal and an action can be
yet you know you can clean the beach or
you can teach young girls about early
pregnancy so these girls in winning in
Nairobi they got a chance to come to New
York and playing the finalists this was
just three weeks ago
and here were eight women have actually
never been outside of Kenya and none of
them had passports but by the time in
September they have taken going on from
24 actions to plus hundred actions and
seeing them in the tournament and then
actually you could have playing football
they won the finals in New York it was
amazing Ricca and I was standing at the
finals looking at each other and it&#39;s
like crying and thinking oh my god I
mean this is what this is all for us was
all about it and when they return to
that hometown Kalifa they were received
by the mayor and the entire city village
and they had this victory walk through
that I mean the pictures were amazing
and frost it was like this is a new
superstar football starts in the making
exactly
so we decided that we were going to
create a Women&#39;s World Cup we wanted to
just rethink everything about what a
World Cup should look like because in
the good old days sport was created by
men for men and women had no part in
that
and even though we&#39;re here now in fact
this we had absolutely no influence on
the design of what we know are sports
today and so one of the main things that
we decided we wanted so they&#39;ll get
changing when we&#39;re gonna change the
creating the World Cup was purposed
because in society you know we celebrate
sport for creating friendships and unity
and health and empowerment but if you
think about it
that&#39;s not the purpose of sport that&#39;s
it purpose of real purposes plot is to
find out who&#39;s the strongest and you
know because if you look at the Olympic
movement it&#39;s like a faster higher
stronger that&#39;s the model and these
other qualities of unity and friendship
those are the fortunate outcomes of the
process of finding out who is the
strongest sometimes and sometimes
they&#39;re not
sometimes sport also creams sporting
villains
you know anorexics drug abusers violence
match-fixing is that a problem to us
it&#39;s because it&#39;s a problem because in
this is where the velopment aspect
coming in 2015 193 countries met at the
UN and decided to sign the 17
sustainable development goals these
girls are the biggest barriers and
challenges to progress and development
for Humanity today they are the must win
the battles of our generation and sport
was named as an important enabler of
sustainable development
but if sport is going to live up to this
potential of being an important
mobilizer enabler for sustainable
development if sport is going to stay
relevant in our society and be part of
the solution and not having a problem
all these good things that we attached
and we associated sport they cannot be a
go in
byproduct of what we do so we decided to
create a World Cup we&#39;re doing good is
actually part of the sport where the
enablers and mobilizers as valued
players on a team has to be strong
football players so we choose Joseph&#39;s
stay with the verticals as the driver
for the ones that was executed you know
be the pilot people have been sick
action before so when a team signs up
they can pick one of those goals like no
poverty and they can take actions from
when they sign up and leading up to the
tournament and hopefully we also wanted
to play with the idea of in a sports
arena what does it look like I mean for
most of us and when you kind of look at
the stadiums today they have a little
bit of a resembling for a calculator
arena so for us this is from the
tournament in New York we had a few
weeks ago where we had to go inside
we&#39;re going to be in the park but those
main and this is a space that is not
only used for fashion shows and book
fairs you can see through it and you can
see what goes on inside and we can move
all our fields and we can have a
communal dinner that we&#39;d always have
with all the teams just having
conversations so we also all know the
art world I think in many ways for me
growing up as a player and it&#39;s they
connected together I mean we play phul
we practice that&#39;s always a sure there&#39;s
always a game so young is here see it
was also even 2p ambassador and big show
of central organza who is a peace
nominee and they will have here also
from candy affection brand they come
along and they risk the games giving us
that shine we have and then we have
Annie Lennox who nominated a dream team
player for an energy free music that we
put together from young feminists from
all over the world that came together in
New York to play under what&#39;s called the
sp3 5 cream team so in a sense of all of
these put together this and the art
world gave us the idea of creating a new
point system so when you actually play
in our tournament you get four points
after each game you get one point for
how much you&#39;re the exadata for the goal
that they take to play for you get one
point for creative style you get one
point for engaging the crowd speaking up
and you get one point for actually
winning the football so we had a concept
we had a new point system now we have to
do a figure out how to finance on your
World Cup you just have to find some
partners and sponsors who just love the
idea of a sporting event that was for
everyday women
we&#39;re creating a better world and
creating friendships and unity was the
fundamental building stones piece of
cake right so when we looked at regular
sporting events and these huge
restrictive manholes that comes with
them and have massive cost attached and
we just had to challenge herself to find
a different model where we could create
a local a global brand but a local sense
of co-creation with our partners and the
first part that we chose was the United
Nations Development Programme because
they&#39;re everywhere and we actually
wanted to make sure that when our teams
took actions for these global goals they
would be seen and recognized by the UN
system and that&#39;s also why we hold a
global file of in New York City during
the UN General Assembly so we get
politicians and UN officials coming to
the games and just watching these teams
and seeing them in action then we add it
in say the children and gain as global
partners because they&#39;re just everywhere
and we can go everywhere with them
then within each tournament we set this
dream team of partners from as for the
art world from education government NGOs
private sector and they&#39;re kind of like
these we think of them as the Avengers
it&#39;s like this dream team of partners
that each use their superpower to create
an amazing event and this this great
diversity of partners also creates a
real live dialogue about what we all
need to do to reach these goals and they
are united by their shared commitment to
actually reaching the goals and also a
commitment to using sport to communicate
about them and then the diversity of the
proudest of trickles into the kinds of
teams that we actually addressed at
attract to play so we&#39;ve had had teams
these are lawyers and business women
from uganda we&#39;ve had teams of let&#39;s see
yeah these are teachers from Bangkok
actual teachers other school in Bangkok
we&#39;ve had cool other text phone from New
York and we&#39;ve had you know Muslim
gender activists playing even jobs
playing soccer like that just such a
great experience and people keep asking
us you know what&#39;s pushing business
model but it&#39;s just it&#39;s so much more of
a it&#39;s more of a network model more of a
movement where we build an organization
that&#39;s based on relationships of trust
and a passion for repurposing sport to
be fit for women and to be fit for the
future that we want so we exhales we&#39;ll
make false so again men by men and today
there&#39;s 30 million plus women down to
the age of 12 that actually plays with
that same size ball and growing up
playing I knew that there was definitely
more injuries
and when you realize that there is about
six times as many injuries among female
players and boys kind of old
and I was a coach at the time I was and
I had a daughter and have a daughter was
playing and there was like there was two
things we could either do we could see
if we could come up with solution for
this problem
or we could stop playing football and do
another sport if that was like the
options and so we started calling around
and diving in to work with Sciences to
find out what was really about kicking
and passing and hitting and about the
innings today is that with the headaches
of races that we use what we are heading
to a slice of what&#39;s called five the not
ours but the standard size ball is that
our hexa 10 acceleration is above the
level where we can get compressions and
what we know today is that concussions
is all these little ones that we all
know that kind of doomed when we you
know hits a ball they have a huge impact
on future illnesses like depression and
and Alzheimer&#39;s so we was like we really
need to do something and of course I
mean I know that there&#39;s little bit I&#39;m
a FEMINIST fighter and I think that we
all and said myself included was
thinking shit you know this is this is
for last you know football is like our
last thing in in inequality in a way but
I think we were stigmatized I think I
was taking class to think that I only
counted if I did the same as men and
when we look about it I mean I don&#39;t
want where I&#39;m wearing 46 issues right
and I have my perfectly fit bike and
there&#39;s nothing in that and then I when
I started talking to riggers could have
run to over hurdles
he&#39;s like all other sports have adapted
to fit women to give us a fair chance to
actually succeed and leave some
potential and there&#39;s something about
injuries is that when we know that when
we had two serious injuries there&#39;s a
fair chance that we are not going to go
back onto the field anymore and that
means the football that moves down to
the age of seven seen often seen so so
we became all the losers
let&#39;s pee but we did and since 2008 I
mean we board the corner home bro
factory and we ain&#39;t made our first 8
calculated balls and roll on them size
matters and ever since that we&#39;ve had
we&#39;ve done a fair amount of who falls by
now and they won&#39;t have a purpose in
life so the black ones were made for for
supporting the Afghan women&#39;s national
team to get that seed bus and called the
ball what&#39;s the buzz about and we&#39;ve had
the orange one who supported women
living in refugee camps and and of
course the next one now is that there&#39;s
a signature on it by this guy earring is
of course our contribution to UN about
helping way where we can make sure that
everybody knows about the single
dwelling and another thing we do to
spread the word about these goals which
is one last idea to leave with you that
we think is worth sharing is the idea of
physical education as in education
that&#39;s physical because we know that the
most efficient way to teach some things
to learn something is through our bodies
so where would we go with the global
balls World Cup we also work with
coaches and teachers and schools and we
develop these impact games that are
football drills that teach children
about each goal and how the kids come up
with games themselves so they learn
about the goals and we do that because
we honestly think the sport has an
amazing power to create a whole new
generation of global citizens that are
aware of their responsibilities to
people and planet and that is just
essential because if we are to reach
these goals we all need to know what
we&#39;re fighting for kind of looks like
this so last year we won an IRC Award
for our work in women and sport for your
and the interesting thing is I mean I
remember getting the mail and they say
doing the twelve we were off and he was
like turning to my boyfriend and saying
give it this is really bad damn and he
kind of is like oh my god
and I was like what and so it turns out
that and I don&#39;t think that what you
will actually just walking around and
you coaching women plus 40 in refugee
camps you don&#39;t think about getting a
voice from the Olympic Committee I will
say that the reaction I mean I started
crying and I was like oh my god I think
the whole emotional thing of being
recognized in a sense I think that&#39;s
what we in a million years wanna pass on
to all of those teams that are actually
showing up to play in our for them to
show up but for them also to take the
action for the world that we want and so
since 2015 we&#39;ve been moving out into
the world I mean I reach is growing up
hearts are growing almost a thousand
women have played in our tournaments as
they&#39;ve taken actions on five different
continents in fact in four tournaments
for the goals and finding they&#39;re in a
sport start and we do believe this room
for a World Cup for the world and so if
to answer the question I mean if women
have been in a social architecture
football we have a little video to show
you that at least from our perspective
this is what it would look like so thank
you an activist soccer tournament we use
the power of sport to connect girls and
women around the world to take action on
the United Nations 17 global goals
our teams are motivated by the
for soccer and their desire to change
the world this is not your average World
Cup sometimes you want to change things
you need to change the rules so we
didn&#39;t leave each team decides which
global goal to play for for example
quality education with climate action to
qualify teams must take action on their
global goal before the cup for example
they could raise money for the local
school or a range of climate
demonstration there for soccer
performance alone does not determine
their way to cup actions for the global
goals and soccer performance are equally
important if you want to win as a
partner sponsor or player the global
goals World Cup you will be joining a
local and global community that is
changing lives every invite politicians
artists journalists to celebrate and
learn about the actions the team&#39;s
partners and sponsors have taken to help
accelerate progress towards the global
goals within the next three years there
will be World Cups on all continents and
every year the winning teams will meet
in New York City during the UN General
to compete for the global Girls World
Cup back to this trophy we will play
until the global goals have been reached
are you with us
