Kirra tato
it&#39;s a really great pleasure for me to
talk to you tonight about how we are
governed about constitutional change we
are one of the world&#39;s oldest
democracies but I think we need some
democratic renewal I came to this
university the very University where
this talk is being recorded in 1960 to
study law and politics and I became
absolutely fascinated with how this
country is governed I became so
interested in it that I became a law
professor and I&#39;ve taught constitutional
law in four countries I once taught it
to American students in France but I
taught them the Turkish Constitution can
you imagine that I later wrote a book
called unbridled power in which I said
there was too much executive power and
government and that we needed a little
reform and we needed parliamentary
reform and we&#39;ve had some but not enough
I then went into Parliament and managed
to become a minister which many MPs want
to do when they go there I became
Minister of Justice attorney general I
became leader of the House Deputy Prime
Minister and finally Prime Minister when
I left politics I started practicing law
in Wellington and I became president of
the Law Commission so I&#39;ve been lucky
enough to see how the New Zealand
government works in many from many
different points of view and the
conclusion that I reached was that while
we do okay in New Zealand we could do
much better and we need to repair our
Constitution I met Andrew Butler many
years ago when he arrived in New Zealand
as a young Irish lawyer he&#39;s now a
partner in Russell McVeigh and we joined
forces and we wrote this book called a
constitution for our tea Aurora New
Zealand
what it says is that we should have a
written constitution a codified
Constitution that sets out the rules
Andrew comes from Island they have that
sort of Constitution there it is a great
help well you know what is a
constitution a constitution is something
that makes people go to sleep if you
talk about it the important thing to
remember about a constitution is that it
sets out the rules for the government
and those rules have to be contained in
institutions and those institutions will
comprise a legislature that is a place
that makes makes law you can&#39;t do
without law in a democracy and we have
to have an executive someone who carries
out the government on a day to day basis
and in New Zealand that is the cabinet
in the public service and you also must
have a judiciary and the judiciary have
to interpret the laws because of the
same people who made the law both
enforced it and adjudicated on it you&#39;d
have a perfect recipe for a dictatorship
in a democracy you need to divide the
powers up so that is what we have
endeavoured to do in this book we have
had four hundred submissions we got a
website you can see the website on our
logo we want more submissions the
submissions closed on the 1st of
December this year we are going to write
a second book that sets out our revised
ideas about how the New Zealand
Constitution should work because you
know the New Zealand Constitution is
very unusual we are one of three
countries in the world that do not have
a written codified Constitution it&#39;s
like riding a bike with no hands you can
easily fall off I think we often do
there have been plenty of policy
blunders in New Zealand
think of the terrible mind disaster on
the west coast think of leaky homes
think of climate change
think of our polluted rivers all these
things are governed by law all these
laws are made by Parliament and often
they&#39;re made too quickly and our
lawmaking and policymaking system needs
to be improved
you know democracies are in some trouble
in the West these days we&#39;ve had in the
United Kingdom brexit they&#39;re not happy
they&#39;ve had a series of constitutional
problems there they are one of the three
countries that don&#39;t have a written
codified Constitution the other ones
Israel and the third one is us I don&#39;t
think this sort of exceptionalism isn&#39;t
necessarily proving its worth to us I
also think that it&#39;s really important
that we actually stop and think a little
bit before we do things we&#39;ve just had
an election it was quite exciting we had
we had policies like blizzard&#39;s coming
down upon us day after day from party
after party and you couldn&#39;t figure out
at the end of it what the result was
going to be we&#39;ll get a government out
of this that&#39;s what an election for is
for it does the House of Representatives
are the ones who choose the government
under our revised electoral system but
you don&#39;t know what the policy is going
to turn out like so what we ought to be
doing is having democracy all year round
seven days a week all the time we
shouldn&#39;t just be waiting to have it at
election time at election time was when
the voters have the most power but of
course we should have people involved in
the decisions citizens involved in the
decisions all the time not just some of
the time that means some profound
changes we need to have deliberative
democracy and in a deliberative
democracy citizens are involved
all the time the abuse are sort they are
consulted when plans are made for big
decisions they are announced and people
can see them and think about them and
make their views known one of the
difficulties with our Parliament these
days is they spend so much time
negotiating and talking with each other
that they forget about the public who
they are supposed to be serving and I
really do think they need to be more
outward looking and they need to take on
board much more of what the public
thinks about things because one of the
problems with both brexit and indeed
what is going on in the United States
that it demonstrates that people have
less faith and democracy than they used
to they feel disconnected from it they
don&#39;t feel the decisions are being made
in their interest and it of course it is
very important a democracy if people
don&#39;t have confidence in it you&#39;re going
to have all sorts of problems and that&#39;s
what&#39;s happening in Western countries
and we&#39;re not immune from that we have
to repair our democracy while we&#39;ve got
time we&#39;re not in this terrible
difficulty that they&#39;re in in the UK or
the United States but we never want to
get into that difficulty we need to pay
attention to how we are governed and we
need to do it better now
one of the things we can do well the
first thing we could do would be to
educate people about how the system
works because it tell us complicated and
do you know that by 2023 there will be
more people in New Zealand of Asian
ethnic origin than there are Maori in
New Zealand and you can&#39;t expect all the
people who come here from overseas to
understand by osmosis how this system
works they ought to be able to find out
how do they find out they look at the
Constitution where they they find it you
can&#39;t find it
why can&#39;t you find it because it isn&#39;t
written down where is it it&#39;s in a whole
lot of different UK statutes and New
Zealand statutes and prerogative
instruments some of the biggest legal
powers are contained in the letters
patent or which create the office of
governor-general how many of you read
the letters patent I&#39;ve bet there isn&#39;t
anyone in this room who&#39;s read them yet
they&#39;re part of our Constitution the
danger is if people can&#39;t find out what
the rules are they aren&#39;t going to take
much part in the way the government
works that is a serious TT that we have
so what we need to do is to have more
civics better education we need to have
citizenship education we need to be able
to say to people this is how our
government works you are a respected
office holder in it because you&#39;re a
boater young people tend to be turned
off by this system I found that out
teaching advanced public law this year
and why are they turned off because they
don&#39;t think it&#39;s in their interests they
certainly don&#39;t think the time of change
policies are in their interests I think
it&#39;s probably time to give 16 year olds
the boat so if we educated them properly
at school and gave them the boat they&#39;d
vote always our voting levels are not
high enough and once you get a democracy
where people don&#39;t care anymore you lose
your democratic freedoms which have been
hard won over many centuries so we need
to have a much more deliberative
democracy with much better education
about how it works
and the first way of doing that is to
write the rules down so people can see
them well now what would you put in the
Constitution we&#39;ve made some proposals
about that and I&#39;ll just summarize them
for you first of all we want a codified
Constitution that everyone can see in
one relatively short document that sets
out the basic rules about how power is
used in a society in this society the
second thing is we think that this
constitution should be superior
in law that is to say it&#39;s not like all
the other statutes that we have on the
books that can be changed by a majority
of one with diligent use of the urgency
provisions of the Standing Orders of the
Parliament overnight that happens here
it happened in 2013 when the carers of
people who are handicapped fought
through the courts to get a right to
some money for to reimburse them for
that caring after going through three
levels of the legal system the
government took it away using urgency in
one day
no Select Committee hearings at all they
made it a matter of competence and
supply and the rights were gone just
like that that&#39;s not the way things
should be done and a properly organised
democracy on 37 occasions in the 26
years that we&#39;ve had the Bill of Rights
the Parliament has overruled it now the
Parliament should be bound by it we say
they shouldn&#39;t be able to take people&#39;s
rights away whenever they feel like it
so that&#39;s the second thing we would do
we would make the Constitution superior
law and would have the Bill of Rights in
it we would also have make the make the
head of state a New Zealand er we think
the monarchy served New Zealand very
well but we&#39;ve got to the stage now
where we need our own head of state our
own identity we&#39;re not a colony as we
started out we&#39;re a self-reliant
competent democracy we ought to stand on
our own feet forge our own identity in
our own space in this world we need to
do that we need also to limit the use of
urgency in the Parliament we need to
have more rule of law by increasing the
ability of the courts to rule on rights
matters but we don&#39;t want to have an
American Constitution here we do want to
ensure that Parliament has the last word
on all matters but only if it breached
the Constitution only if it can raise a
75% majority in the house for it there
are considerable protections in that now
these changes
important they&#39;re not the only changes
the Treaty of Waitangi is one of our
most important documents the treaty is
one of the most difficult issues we&#39;ve
faced and we have to have a profound
national conversation to sort that out
because we have it is really important I
do say to you this that in New Zealand
by democratic methods by listening to
people by being tolerant by having a
profound national conversation we can
make our government work better we can
do that we should do that when we should
do it when we&#39;re not in a crisis so that
we have time to sort it out many
constitutions are forged in times of
crisis it&#39;s better not to do that so I
urge all New Zealanders think about your
Constitution thank you
[Applause]
you
