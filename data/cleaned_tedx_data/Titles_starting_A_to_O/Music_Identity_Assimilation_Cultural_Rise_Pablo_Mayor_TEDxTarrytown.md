so as you can tell I&#39;m a musician but
I&#39;m also bad no and I&#39;m also an educator
and the focus of everything I&#39;m about to
share with you has come with experience
of doing this from composing music
writing producing plane and then
teaching from the little ones to Grandpa
and Grandma I come I was born in
Colombia Colombia South America and my
friends I just realized that I&#39;ve been
in in your Warren&#39;s in the United States
living longer that I believe in Colombia
and get in all and my friends in
Colombia
they did they say that I became a
Kringle well my friends here in the
United States they say that I&#39;m
sometimes I&#39;m too laid-back when you
come to this country I was able to come
here to study it something I thank my
parents for being able to help me
accomplish that I went to University of
North Texas and I got my bachelor&#39;s and
master&#39;s degrees as a jazz musician and
then I went back to Colombia for a year
and then for two reasons I ended up in
New York number one my wife
[Applause]
and then the daydream of New York and
you&#39;re felt right to me
your fell like this is it why because in
New York I&#39;m able to to be an accepted
for where I come from and yet be able to
to be around so many cultures which
always attracted me I like to learn and
when you come to the United States there
is a there is a process already very
together very strong method of of over
rival because everyone who arrives here
the idea is to adapt and adapt very
quickly and the country provides the
help you are able to rent a place open
of online bank account everything is in
place for you to start being productive
almost immediately and this exchange you
we ended up having in the workplace
people from all over the world were
already adapting to this to the system
some have to work more than others
depending on where they come from but
that exchange of cultural doesn&#39;t go
very deep when people come to the States
they usually go close to their families
or maybe close to people who speak the
same language or come from the same area
or share the same religious beliefs and
once you leave work something happens
after when you sit with your neighbors
and when you sit with with with
different that people that you&#39;re being
introduced to and suddenly you&#39;re
sharing your food and the music that you
like and and all the different things
that that start to come out and that
common place where maybe there are many
people who don&#39;t have anymore new
friends and they they show their best
face you know it&#39;s like starting a date
everyone is you know in so willing and
they said you know this is what I love
about my country
this is what their food do you try this
and we think this way and then at the
same time you start to get all this
information and say wow I didn&#39;t know
sushi tastes so good you know I&#39;ve been
talking about raw fish now that was
something that was new for me it puts
you in a place of love you share the
best and you receive the best from
people spend ten years since the
election of President Obama died I
started to think about the American
culture and what it is and now I call
him my culture since I became a citizen
four years ago and right now I feel like
we&#39;re sort of looking looking ourselves
and looking at trying to define you know
what is what it is what is the American
culture and and depending on where you
are from you get different points of
view you you you start to see a mirror
in different phases and they and the
answer the the definition that you get
from people is always different and to
me is something that I did I just see
potential I see a rich I see richness
and I see an opportunity for this to
become even a greater place some others
don&#39;t see it that way and they want to
change it and go back to the way it used
to be and and alter it and once again we
come to that that thought that for us to
be able to advance because no I don&#39;t
thing is all we need is to look at
reality and the way things are we just
need to face it with love and and when
that happens change
happens I&#39;m gonna give you an example I
learned to iron my clothes here and it&#39;s
especially important when when you learn
by example there happens to be from my
father-in-law who happens to be a
lieutenant colonel of the Air Force and
this privilege doesn&#39;t belong to every
Colombian men is something that has been
designated to women so I feel you know
he was inspiring to me and I learned and
and it could be a small thing but it
isn&#39;t his it took it has to do with
adaptation and being able to to look at
things and say okay what can we get out
of this
what kind of we get out of this conflict
I think about what I do
I&#39;m music and at the beginning of the
20th century you have a lot of Cubans
coming and Puerto Ricans coming to New
York and they happen to start running
into the great jazz musicians in in the
streets after they play gig you will
have the Cubans playing with Charlie
Parker and Dizzy Gillespie and jamming
and then now we&#39;re talking about the
concept of the philosophy of jazz which
has been it&#39;s an American thing that has
been exported all over the world and is
recognized as a symbol of human
expression of freedom being adapted
right now to many cultures as a concept
because we talk about melody and harmony
but rhythm rhythm is the language of the
culture is that that&#39;s what defines the
people yet there are many things that
could be shared so from that
relationship now we have Latin jazz and
then the Puerto Ricans and the Cubans
started to really enjoy the music of the
50s and look at Memphis of soul music
and then we have Boogaloo and then
[Music]
and and just raise your hand if you
recognize this rhythm
[Music]
anybody knows what their bossa nova oh
the Brazilians came in and is is part of
it you look at just Buchan and the
creation of bossa nova sin in the United
States is immense there is some so many
bossa Nova&#39;s it really inspired the
spirit of of the people here in the
States
it&#39;s another type of American music oh
then salsa music home salsa music which
I have performed in El Paso Texas I have
performed in Pella Iowa I have danced in
Spokane Washington everyone recognized
what salsa music is and is a mix of more
cultures based on Cuban rhythms yes but
it&#39;s a mix of many cultures that Puerto
Rican also pushed and became an identity
for the people here and we&#39;re talking
about a couple of generations already
now I&#39;m gonna say I have a privilege to
have the best Colombian bass player with
the best Colombian name his name is
David Hertzberg
and a drummer which organ it is to show
his setup of a drum to understand that
we share the same concept he&#39;s got he&#39;s
got instruments from all over the world
his name is Franco Pina from Tucuman
Argentina so I would like to would like
to play for you a piece a composition
which is based on a Colombian rhythm
called bambuco with the influence of
jazz and with the love and care of a
place that is now helping me raise my
children and have my family so this is
called bambuco at Tarrytown
