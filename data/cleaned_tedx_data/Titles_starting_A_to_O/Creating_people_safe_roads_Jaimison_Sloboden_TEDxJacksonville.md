I just did one of the most dangerous
things you can do in Jacksonville I rode
my bike to this event
the City of Jacksonville has been ranked
the fourth worst city in the United
States for pedestrian and bicycle
fatalities per capita according to Smart
Growth America dangerous by design
report as a traffic engineer I took a
deeper dive into that issue and the
problem is much worse than that
the map you see behind me is pedestrian
and bicycle crashes that have occurred
in the last 10 years that&#39;s 7,000 269
and Counting most of these crashes
result in some type of injury many of
them result in significant injury and
even death what I&#39;m here to tell you
today is that a lot of what has to do
with this problem has to do with our
values and that what we need to decide
moving forward is that people matter
more than cars to further illustrate I&#39;m
going to talk about two tragic events
that have occurred the first one only
happened less than two months ago a
bicyclist was on his way to work riding
along when he swayed into traffic he was
struck and critically injured where was
he supposed to ride this is that
location this is the traffic kind of
condition that was going on at the time
there&#39;s no extra space for that
bicyclist to be the second event
happened this summer miss Angie Sanders
aged 68 was on her way home from work
and she stopped a Mayport road at the
Mayport Plaza stopped to do some
shopping
there&#39;s no crosswalk at that location
when you step out she looked to the
right looked to the left and the safe
place to cross is a quarter mile in each
direction so for her to make the safe
journey
a quarter mile is about a ten minute
walk
stop wait for the light cross and then a
10-minute walk back to where she really
wanted to be Mayport road is a six-lane
Road with a real narrow median so
there&#39;s six lanes to cross this day
she&#39;s very tired
she looked it up either way and made the
choice to cross at that location she got
through the first lane the second lane
and then by the third lane she didn&#39;t
make it
these events are happening very
frequently in our city over 7,000
crashes with this potential why our
values and I&#39;m going to demonstrate
examples of how our values of how we&#39;ve
placed to build our space has
contributed to this problem we need to
decide that people matter more than cars
so one thing we know is we have a
problem how did we get here it really
goes back to post-world War two the
automobile came along the promise of
this American Dream the freedom that it
afforded us the suburban lifestyle it
was great freedom of movement
independence all that it was wonderful
so we started setting about building our
cities around that system in Florida I
came a little bit later than post-world
War two because we needed this how many
of us would really be living here if we
didn&#39;t have that by 1960 eighty percent
of all the cars in Florida had air
conditioning our house is rare condition
our buildings were air-conditioned our
cars were air-conditioned we had this
lifestyle of Independence and freedom
and mobility and so we never had to get
out and walk around so our economy
our highway departments got really good
at giving us that designing roads our
highway department said about giving us
a first-class highway system for cars I
relate to this really well because as a
civil engineer I was trained to give you
that okay it&#39;s really hard you think you
might have more cars add some more lanes
if you really want to make sure that
people can go fast and continue on their
trip provide no interruption to that
facility no crosswalks no lights almost
like a freeway so we have valued that
lifestyle for a very long time until we
kind of reach this tipping point where
we have this crisis of crashes and
fatalities so it&#39;s not just about the
roads we need to design our communities
a little bit differently as well so
there is kind of that land component
that we have to make in concert gonna
take a little bit of a segue and talk
about in a parallel example of how we
value and our values kind of relate 20
years ago about young traffic engineer
in Minnesota worked for the city of
Arden Hills and they had a new land
development happening and they were
going to put a road through a parkland
and this City Council was very concerned
about the animal species that were in
that Park so they wanted to make sure
that we took care of all the animals and
I learned all about Florida well before
I moved here that we are great in this
state at taking care of animals
environmentalists have figured out
understood that we need to consolidate
all of the lands and habitat so that the
animals have a place that naturally
takes them to a place where they&#39;re
gonna cross the road and then we spend a
lot of money building a lot of crossings
like this panther crossing we value the
panther as we should there&#39;s only 200 m
left in the state and there are precious
to us and so we take care of them we
take care of the bear we take care of
snakes we can&#39;t
take care of turtles and we even take
care of the little bitty / do ki beach
mouse okay
just learn this a couple weeks ago we
actually put PVC pipes underneath the
road to make sure that they can get
across another example of how we show
our values and this is a something that
really hit me in the last two years I
was working for the Jacksonville
Transportation Authority on providing
safe streets around the bus stops it was
a big program called Complete Streets
and as we were going out and doing
community meetings and talking to people
I was paying a little bit more direct
attention to what was going on in the
media and what I saw it was an article
that looked like this and this has been
repeated you know periodically but the
Jacksonville Sheriff&#39;s Office they&#39;ve
seen the same media report about us
being one of the worst cities in the
country so they&#39;re doing their part to
try and fix the problem and and the
sheriff&#39;s office duty and role is to
enforce so they set about enforcing
jaywalking but ironically at the same
time I came across this article that the
city of st. Paul they were addressing
pedestrian safety issues and they were
out there enforcing vehicles that were
not yielding to pedestrians in the
crosswalk and that was their campaign so
they said that walking is important and
they value that perhaps it would be good
if Jaso had more crosswalks to enforce
we&#39;re working on this problem it&#39;s
simple
there&#39;s kind of four main areas one we
start with the width of our road for
automobiles while there&#39;s some roads
that we&#39;ll need and continue to have to
carry a lot of cars we have many streets
in the city of Jacksonville that no
longer need that number of lanes reduce
them
the other thing we can do is minimize
the width of these lanes to make the
crosswalks a shorter distance and easier
to travel so you don&#39;t have to be a
track star to make it across we also
need to modernize our bike system
actually have one as a start
but what&#39;s really transformed in our
design community and its global it&#39;s not
just United States but we&#39;re seeing more
examples that it&#39;s necessary to provide
kind of protected bike lanes not just
that three foot strip of pavement that
you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s a shoulder or a
place you should be riding your bike my
five year old daughter should be able to
ride her bike on that on that trail on
that system on that road and then
finally we cannot ignore kind of the
land use around there because it&#39;s not
just a road problem it&#39;s a value problem
but it&#39;s also how we create the space
the Mayport Plaza strip mall kind of not
connected to anything not really
promoting walkability the things I need
to educate you on is about my industry
we try and make things easier for
everyone to intuitively understand what
we mean and I&#39;m often reminded by my
family and friends that they have no
idea what I&#39;m talking about
so my education to you is we in our
industry our always seeking public
consent input and an interest so what
you need to do for us to really help
move this along is look for a complete
Street project advertisement Lane
elimination study a road diet project a
context-sensitive design or even a
streetscape project all these projects
kind of we coin these different terms
but they all kind of mean the same thing
we&#39;re out there trying to reinvent the
space for better walkability and and
bike bikeability
and safety but don&#39;t ignore and you
should really the big red flag to put
out there is if you see a capacity
project the red flag on that is the
capacity may be needed
you know the additional capacity may be
needed but the way we&#39;re designing our
space now is we are not doing capacity
at the exclusion of people walking and
biking so those first border that I
mentioned you should be really active
and supportive behind and then the
capacity type projects you should be a
little bit skeptical and ready to go
after it if need be this is a political
will problem that we we face the
agencies are really making an effort
City of Jacksonville just recently
adopted what I think is a modern and
very good bicycle and pedestrian master
plan the Jacksonville Transportation
Authority has just made Complete Streets
their number one priority to make sure
that they&#39;re taking care of their
pedestrian and their transit customers
the Florida Department of Transportation
took great notice because the state of
Florida is far and away the worst state
in the country in this area and so their
way of dressing it as a policy change
and a complete rewrite of all the sacred
Scrolls of design manuals and all that
so they have become a Complete Streets
agency these are all great plans and
great ideas but they&#39;re not going to
happen unless we hear get behind that
and make it happen
so finally we the people of Jacksonville
people matter more than cars thank you
you
