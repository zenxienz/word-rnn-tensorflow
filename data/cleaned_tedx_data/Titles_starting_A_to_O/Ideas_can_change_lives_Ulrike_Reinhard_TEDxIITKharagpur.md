Oh
hello everybody in turn bar which is a
small village in rule Madhya Pradesh we
fill the State Park
we call it Chun ba castle building a
state park might seem like you know a
little small intervention but it turned
out to be much much more
junga castle has really you know pushed
this village into life it has broken
taboos had overcome barriers and today I
would say it has become a symbol for
sweeping far-reaching change like
probably any other city any other
village in India changhua was deeply
divided by cost they were the adivasi
the outcasts and they unearthed who
dominated the village so it wasn&#39;t a big
surprise when the skatepark was build
that the Yadav boys were the first ones
to come there but this has slowly
changed one day I came there and there
was at the far end of the park there was
this little anniversary boy I&#39;m
cat-sitting he was sitting there for
hours just watching what the others were
doing at this fateful it was completely
in France in what he saw he was just in
awe but he would never ever dare to ask
one of the other guys to hand him over
as hateful next day same thing kept
sitting there at the far end just
watching on the third day when he came
back I walked over and I said you want
to give it a try
so he looked at me he smiled he nodded I
walked over to a yard up guy took a
skateboard he wasn&#39;t so happy to give it
away I gave it to him cash and you know
this guy it just taken the skateboard he
looked at it and he started running
he dropped the board he jumped on it and
it was just like almost like sailing
away this guy really is was a
natural-born skateboarder and today he&#39;s
one of our best skateboarders and he
comes every day to the park the ice
between the cast finally broke one
morning during our yoga sessions we
always start with a big big circle and
there was just a little girl I was
probably like three years old it was 30
like hell you know she was standing
there and no one would include her and
the surfer so I reached out and the
moment I did say P 1 of our yet of
choice he walked with me both of us we
took her hand
we included her in the circle and from
this day onward at least at the skate
park I would say the issue of cast
never ever showed its ugly face again
India probably has like 700,000 villages
60 to 70 percent of your population is
living there and most of these people I
don&#39;t know how many of you have been
into these small villages they really
struggle to survive they have they have
Elliott they hardly have any electricity
they have no sanitation health issues
are really huge and even though on the
other side you always hear that you know
a lot of government programs a lot of
government schemes are in place a lot of
NGOs are working there and still that
change there is not visible it&#39;s not
tangible tangible why is this so I
believe
that most of these programs let it be
government let it be NGO they almost
like three defined products they are
made for the villagers for the children
not with them they are based upon notice
clear distinction between those who know
and those who need to be taught so if
there is no involvement of the people
who at the end of the day should use
these solutions they are not involved in
the creation process of this solution
and this is exactly what we do
differently at changhua castle our
approach and this is also where the
little tiny wee in our logo comes in
it&#39;s very clearly a community approach
we include all the stakeholders in the
village and whatever we do we co-create
and collaborate with actually very
innovative management tools together
with the villagers so during this
process these villagers these kids they
take responsibility they take ownership
of the solution and this is why usually
whatever we design has a very high
acceptance rate when I first came into
town bar this is like two and a half
years ago I was varying his system I
didn&#39;t want to go actually because you
know Panna this is the next bigger town
probably to like people living there
it&#39;s already kind at the end of the
world so why would I even go further
Chunhua is six 70 kilometers off the
main road from Paulo but I went there
and when I arrived I instinctively felt
wow this
this is the right place because when I
was standing there on this small little
hill overlooking the one acre of land
where we would later build the skatepark
on I you know I saw really everything
what became kind of close to my heart
over the last couple of years when I was
trying when I&#39;m driving on my bullet
bike through the heart of India it was
kind of wild was kind of rough look
still very very in the innocent and it
was really beautiful so I really knew
that I had found the place three months
later we started to build the skatepark
three and a half months later the skate
park was built during the process there
were various dynamics inside the village
since I don&#39;t speak the language and I&#39;m
not intending to learn you know all this
potential problems somehow stood away
from me the villagers of course came
because we gave them employment they got
paid on a daily basis so why wouldn&#39;t
they come but the kids were with us from
the very first day when we had caught
the first tram of the skatepark and when
it was tried out they used it as a slide
so they were immediately evolved
involved we had our Grand Opening almost
exactly two years ago it was in April
2015 the grand opening was nothing but
that I handed over twenty skateboards to
each skateboard we had a set of helmets
and safety gears and this was it I
didn&#39;t leave but they were also know
instructors instructors there were no
teachers we didn&#39;t had any lessons you
know I only told the kids you need to
take care of these skateboards and you
have to share them for me it was amazing
to see how fair
these kids were learning it was really
surprisingly fast there were little
teams built you know the older kids were
help helping the younger kids the better
skilled the leathers the lesser skilled
and clearly those much wanted principles
of co-creation and collaboration were
put into place by children
it wasn&#39;t ordained from top it simply
happened and everything really really
true very organically so the change we
saw what everything happened was really
made by the kids I would say that canva
somehow is smiling John Barr is since
the skate park has arrived in some kind
of transformation mode and the major
change makers are these kids without
even realizing that they are I&#39;m going
to give you two examples one is Asha
Asha is a 17 year old algaas ago she
attended our first summer camp which we
did in summer 2015 and she was very very
eager to learn English so every day she
took she came to the English lessons we
had a teach for India fellow there so
she came and she was really really
engaged and after these four weeks she
really spoke pretty well English she
could address you know what you want me
to say and somehow I felt that we should
give her something in reward so I asked
her I shall do you want to go to England
to learn better English and she said yes
of course
and she smiled so I went back home to
our parents and I asked her parents if
they would be ready to let her go
and I simply said no so it was a process
over eight months you know going back
going force I brought in the mother
that&#39;s a Panna I brought in her very
best teachers I brought in friends of
mine whoever somehow trying to convince
her parents who let her go to have a
different kind of exposure and then you
know might look into a brighter future
they simply said no one day I was
standing with a friend in the really in
the heat of the Sun in June in the
fields and I was talking to her mother
my friend he was translating everything
what I was saying in English into a
Hindi and by looking at them I all of a
sudden realized to know if I would speak
to this woman who Ash&#39;s mother in German
it would have been the same effect
she didn&#39;t even understand his words she
didn&#39;t know what it means going from
London or going to UK for them
it&#39;s simply very very far away and it&#39;s
taking the kid away so this was the day
when we changed our conversation and
when I was trying them to convince them
that a shark could learn English could
stay with us in the village and then you
know become my voice and a role model
for other girls in the village and keep
on what we are doing
this was the day where at least then the
parents changed their minds and Ash&#39;s
persistence I in-between thought this
would go nowhere but ash has persistence
really kept me going and after eight
months the parents finally agreed and
said we let her go they also agreed at
the same time not to marry her when
she&#39;s coming back and really let her
accept the job probably with our
organisation
we work in the village so this was
really an individual pass Asha has taken
starting from the summer camp going
almost he&#39;s eight nine months and now we
actually applied three days ago
for the visa in Delhi she was the first
one in in changhua to get a passport and
this was a big thing
first of all adi bossy girl Adivasi
second a girl this has never ever
happened in this village before so this
was a big big thing another example is
sheek Louch he finished eighth grade he
couldn&#39;t read and write it just you know
basically he probably would have dropped
out from ninth grade his parents also
didn&#39;t have the money to send him
somehow but at the skatepark this guy
really developed his social skills
he became the silent leader and whenever
someone was needed he was simply there
for us without being asked so when I had
the chance for scholarship it for me it
was a very easy easy thing to select him
and to let him take this scholarship the
problem was what to do with him because
he was lacking all the kind of skills he
would need when you apply to ninth grade
school anywhere in India so we designed
a very individual program together with
a couple of partners we were working
with it has had it by a very nice school
in Noida the name is Patrick T and he
for I think he will finish in May his
first year he really got a very
individualized program he spent six
months in the school in Delhi for
another three months he went to a kisum
school because farming is for these it&#39;s
a very very essential thing 8090 percent
of the kids to work in the fields in the
villages so he learnt more about farming
and currently he&#39;s at an art school
two hours away from our state park and
he&#39;s really really enjoying his time and
understanding what learning can be good
for so these two examples and I could
give you another ten show pretty much
what we do a ton Bob we really put the
kid the single kid in the center of
everything we do and these kids no
matter what they do they never ever have
to ask for permission they can simply go
and they can simply do nevertheless we
have right from the beginning created
two rules which helped us you know I
think to move much faster than we
expected these two rules where the first
one is no school no skateboarding the
second one is goals first no school no
skateboarding has basically swept the
kids into the school our best 20-25
skateboarders they go regularly to
school now another 20 they show up on a
more frequent basis and the guy who is
our best skateboarder he never ever went
to school before but when he heard about
the rule he said I&#39;m gonna be topper at
school pretty soon school it hasn&#39;t
stopped and he sure is the teachers keep
telling us that the overall awareness of
the kids is pretty high motivation is at
an all-time high the kids are now eager
to learn and they are really really
challenging the teachers the rural girls
first we put into play because in this
part of the world the standing of the
girls is very bad actually in the
village itself they wouldn&#39;t hesitate to
kill a girl by the time of birth because
she&#39;s probably the third or fourth girl
they cannot afford to pay the dowry so
girls have no place in the society so we
were thinking a
some kind of way how to implement this
gender inequality in our daily
activities and this girl&#39;s first thing
is really working no matter how small
the girl is or how big the guy is if the
girl comes to the skateboard skate park
and says girls first she will always get
a skateboard as I said earlier changhua
the village itself with all these things
happening the kids traveling abroad the
kids going to different places visitors
are coming in from all over the world
Chunhua the village itself is really out
of balance we have disrupted this
village and disruption is it&#39;s a pretty
interesting thing because on one hand
you&#39;re really eager you are curious
about the unknown while at the same time
you&#39;re a little bit scary and frightened
you know to embrace it so this kind of
tension really makes people move and you
need this kind of movement to start
change and this is where we come in we
are not telling the villagers or the
kids what to do we simply guide them
once they started to move and we see our
roles also not in defining where they go
but simply helping them to find their
own way while they walk chandra castle
the concept is still pretty young we are
only there for two years now so it&#39;s far
too early to draw any kind of
conclusions but what I can clearly say
is that this model of you know the art
of letting go
not asking for permissions everyone is
evil equal that this kind of model has
has the power to disrupt the village to
unbalance it and you know to make the
people move forward and find their own
way for us my dream is or my work will
end when we no longer have to disrupt
them to make the move I would say the
villages and especially the kids
they now have a dream of a better future
for their own they have stopped to exist
they really have started living they
start to survive they started thriving
and once in a while when I play the last
four kilometres off the main road down
through Anwar I think about this African
proverb which says it takes a village to
raise a child
I think in John Guare we have created
our own version of it we truly say it
takes the children who transform a
village thank you
you
