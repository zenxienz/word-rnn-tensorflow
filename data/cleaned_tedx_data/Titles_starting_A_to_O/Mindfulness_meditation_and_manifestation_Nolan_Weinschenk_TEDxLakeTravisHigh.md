so what I&#39;m about to say may sound
completely crazy and if you believe that
that&#39;s totally fine even Einstein called
this spooky action at a distance but
scientists have proven time and time
again that our mindset and our
consciousness has a huge impact on the
world around us so I&#39;m sure some of you
have heard of Schrodinger&#39;s cat it&#39;s a
famous mental experiment so don&#39;t worry
no cats were actually harmed in the
making of this but the idea is that
Schrodinger took a box and when he put
in that box was a decaying particle that
had exactly a 50% chance of decaying and
what he did is he also put a Geiger
counter in that box which is really just
a term for something that can detect if
a particle has decayed and that Geiger
counter is attached to a hammer and that
hammer has exactly a 50% chance of
breaking a chemical flask that could
kill what is ever in the box all that
really means is that whatever in the box
is exactly a 50% chance of getting
killed so what Schrodinger did is he
took a cat in his head put it in the box
close the box completely there&#39;s no way
to see anything that&#39;s going on inside
the box and in this state the cat which
had a 50% chance of being dead or alive
is both dead and alive so let me explain
that so there&#39;s this idea in quantum
physics called superposition which is
the idea that a particle will take up
every single state it can possibly be in
when unobserved the cat in that box had
only two states dead or alive but the
second he opened that box the second
Schrodinger looked at that cat that cat
collapsed the wavefunction of
possibilities which is just every single
possible state the particle or the cat
could be in to a single state so when he
opened the box the cat was either dead
or alive so another really famous
experiment is called the double slit
experiment and so today we have a wall
with two slits in it and then a wall
behind that so say I&#39;m throwing baseball
just throwing baseballs at this wall
what&#39;s going to happen
is that behind those double slits it&#39;s
gonna create a pattern as so pretty
expected what happens is if you take a
wavelength or a wave and or it could be
just a light wave or a water wave or
anything it doesn&#39;t matter when it the
light goes through those two slits they
collide into a way that creates an
interference pattern as you can see on
the screen some areas are magnified in
some areas are completely zero there&#39;s
nothing there based off of the way the
waves function so what physicists
decided to do is to see what would
happen if they did this to an electron
so what they did is they just flooded
these two double slits with electrons
just thousands thousands thousands
electrons what happens is it made a
wavelength pattern which was kind of
confusing to physicists so they slowed
it down it shot one electron at a time
just to see what would happen and this
is the result even though it was just
one electron a single particle with mass
just like my hand
it somehow went through two slits this
really confused physicists as I&#39;m sure
confused you just as much as it confused
me because how can a single particle
with mass go through two slits and
create the pattern that you saw there as
those two particles interacted so what
they did is they set up a camera to try
to see which of the two slits the actual
particle went through what happened is
as soon as they observed the particle
the particle started resembling the
baseball&#39;s or the particles we were
talking about earlier it started going
through one slit or the other it&#39;s
stopped resembling a wave and started
resembling a particle and the only thing
that changed was observation going back
to what we talked about earlier about
superposition the particle when it was
unobserved was going through both slits
because those were the two states it
could possibly go through but the second
that particle was observed it had to
choose either the left slit or the right
slit but not both so at this point we
have to question is the wavefunction
collapse really random
when Schrodinger opens that box that cat
has a
exactly 50% chance of being dead or live
right when you shoot those particles
through the slits observed it has a 50%
chance of going through the left and a
50% chance of going to the right but
what if that&#39;s not the case so dr. Emoto
who&#39;s a really famous quantum physicist
did experiment that&#39;s pretty much just
called the Rice experiment and so what
he did is he took a jar of rice and he
labeled that good and he took another
jar of rice and he labeled that bad and
bad intention here and good intention
here and I know you might call him
clinically insane for talking to rice
but he actually did this and what
happened is after a month of telling the
good rice you&#39;re so good I love you and
telling the bad rice I hate you you&#39;re
terrible rice this is the results the
love rice the good rice that had good
intentions no matter what you say it&#39;s
about the intention that&#39;s behind that
word had turned into pretty much the
same exact color that had originally
been there however the hate rice has
started molding and deteriorating and
looks pretty gross no for those skeptics
out there who believe there&#39;s a lot of
extraneous variables in this type of
situation well the rice could have been
healthier in this jar or whatever you
want to say here&#39;s an example of
something that has no extraneous
variables it&#39;s called the global
consciousness project
so what Princeton researchers did is
they took data from all around the world
of random number generators and they
looked at that data in correlation with
huge worldwide events like 9/11
rebellions elections and what happened
is that the numbers are completely
random completely random and then when
you hit these big events the numbers
would spike and stop being random a
number generator that&#39;s a computer
program it&#39;s completely autonomous and
has no human interaction with it started
producing non-random sequences of
numbers the only thing that changed was
our consciousness so as you can see
through the rice experiment and the
global consciousness project we have a
huge impact on our world just through
our consciousness and more than that our
actual mindset can have a either
positive impact on our world or a
negative one it just depends on
your mindset and the funny thing is this
has been going on for thousands of years
if you look at pretty much any religion
prayer meditation whatever you want to
call it it really just comes down to
intention setting and consciously
putting yourself in a mindset in most
cases of success however the same thing
can be said for the reverse as we could
see with the hate rice if you put
yourself in a bad mouth mindset that&#39;s
gonna manifest negatively so the
implications for this are really endless
think about the next time you want to
get a good grade on the test just sit
down by yourself for 10 minutes close
your eyes
tell yourself you&#39;ve got a good grade on
that test you know you&#39;re gonna get a
good grade on this test you&#39;re gonna ace
that test just for 10 minutes and maybe
you&#39;ll get an a on that test
next time you want to develop a better
relationship with a friend or someone
you don&#39;t know - well I tell yourself
I&#39;m gonna be best friends with that
person that person is going to be my
best friend that person who I want to
like me is going to like me takes 10
minutes and maybe that person will just
like you so my question to all of you is
why not it only takes 10 minutes thank
you
