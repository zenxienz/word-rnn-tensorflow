everyone knows that growing up and
growing old are not the same thing and I
am not sure which scares me the most
my therapist says it&#39;s good to count to
10 I shut up when I was 10 never really
grew again it was the same year I
learned bees can only sting you once
that sometimes being still is the best
way to protect yourself
I thought you to punch the next year
sometimes moving is the best way to
protect yourself when I was 3 and
needles stung me and I was paralyzed I
learned to walk two times I wonder if
bees which is a different life if they
could sting two times I wonder if I&#39;ll
lose my sense of wonder if I&#39;ll give up
on my dreams and call them fantasies in
that cardboard box voice people get like
if they sit in cubicles for long enough
they become one maybe that&#39;s why we say
don&#39;t be a square I want to fit wherever
I am as if I came into existence right
there like I was always meant to fill
that space my therapist says it&#39;s good
to count to 10 my therapist says I make
mountains out of mole hills and I want
to say I am a mountain but mountains can
be climbed and conquered and I want to
say I am an open flame but fire can be
extinguished and I want to say I am
afraid but I am afraid and the truth is
that I am a planner who can never plan
ahead because I&#39;m always expecting the
unexpected always preparing to run for
cover
I am mire and cover I am fight and
flight
I am panic shaking through body deep
like magic maybe it&#39;s magic I&#39;m magic I
believe in myself so it must be true
when I was six years old I wanted to be
a doctor I cut the pages of my exercise
book in half tearing out smiley face
to treat people&#39;s affliction seven years
later I sat with the notebook and pen
determined to be writing as black sky
ran blue like paint running down a sink
and when I was famous I told everyone
the story of the kid who breathed paper
and ink
I wrote eight stories but didn&#39;t like
them so I made myself number nine I shut
up when I was 10 never really grew again
when I was 11 I found an owl in the
bathroom and was convinced my Hogwarts
letter arrived at 12 I became a walking
target there were 13 times I felt unsafe
14 times I questioned my faith 15
prescribe pills for a smiling face when
I was 16 I learned how punnett squares
work I learnt the word for the smell of
rain on the earth I learned 17 ways to
measure my self-worth the 18th was the
realization that looking for absolution
in sharp objects could only make things
worse when I was 19 I learned that
sometimes people say love when they mean
ownership at 20 I found out that the
world does not stop spinning for anybody
I&#39;m 21 now I&#39;ve started growing again
turns out not everyone does know that
growing up and growing old are not the
same thing
I&#39;m still not sure which scares me the
most
