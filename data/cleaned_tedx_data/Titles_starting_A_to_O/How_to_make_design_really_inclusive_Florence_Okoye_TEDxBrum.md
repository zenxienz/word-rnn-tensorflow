yeah I&#39;m a user experience designer a
fairly trendy new field in this day and
age and my job I primarily work with
digital products so mostly web sites and
apps and I do my best to make them as
accessible and usable and hopefully even
ethical as possible and as someone who
works primarily in the world of the
digital I&#39;m always really interested by
the president set by designers and
design movements of the past in
particular child and Ray Eames
respectively an architect and artist who
became product designers who are
responsible for some of the most
innovative and iconic furniture of the
20th century and were known for using
materials like plywood in exciting and
innovative ways to create a deeply
functional and humanist or still
beautiful accessible technologies and
one of the things that I find
particularly inspiring about that their
work is this fundamental design
philosophy that permeates to their
products and that&#39;s this idea of the
relationship between the designer and
the user as a sort of guest-host
relationship in fact Charles Eames would
go into this in more detail to quote for
him the designer or the architect or
whoever it was making this product their
role was that akin to a good and
thoughtful host all of whose energy goes
into predicting and anticipating the
needs of their user and so as we look at
the technologies and the products that
we use every day that we have become so
dependent on it&#39;s often actually quite
shameful to see how often that guest
host or indeed the host guest
relationship actually breaks down I mean
just think about how your favorite
mapping tool insists that the best way
to get to your friend&#39;s house in

November at 9:00
yeah it&#39;s under the bridge of a poorly
lit can now like off not so sure about
this or think about how difficult it is
to let your favorite social media
platform know that you&#39;ve faced
harassment and abuse from racist and
misogynist online every day we are faced
by examples of the way that our services
do not live up to this guest-host
relationship and I think it&#39;s paramount
for us who are designers of these
systems to ask why after all design has
evolved we don&#39;t or at least we&#39;re not
meant to design for the quasi Platonic
ideal phrases like inclusive design but
is a participatory design community-led
design these are all phrases and
methodologies that we constantly refer
to with our everyday design speak and
yet as someone who&#39;s quite interested in
critical theory I often wonder if part
of the problem is that the way we use
these actually quite radical
methodologies still ends up centering
the designer at the heart of the product
and so we end up in a situation where
even when using inclusive design
frameworks in a sense the designer is
still at the center of it all only in
this case they deign so graciously to
allow the user some input at some point
in the design journey I often think this
is also exemplified in our incredibly
simplistic ways of describing empathy
now empathy is very popular now you know
you hear all the designers talk about it
we&#39;re meant to design with empathy
omentum and pathetically design and yet
what i find interesting is when we talk
about what this means we often use
incredibly simplistic note metaphors
such as put yourself in the other
person&#39;s shoes often forgetting that the
shoes of the other are not in fact on
the same plane and this is an insight
that sociologists and historians and
critical theorists alike have
consistently and repeatedly remind us of
and yet as designers we so often forget
in some ways empathy is not some
universe or transcendent but a substance
that has its own flow and that flow goes
according to the different gradients of
relative social privilege in fact if we
go bit go backwards a bit and really
think about this metaphor for guests and
hosts we kind of realize how absurd
these quite simplistic notions of
designing with empathy are after all a
third guest is say my best friend Sonia
was coming over for dinner
I wouldn&#39;t think okay broccoli green
beans
let me empathize put myself in her
position no I would have taken the time
to have found out and I really engage
with her to understand what her
preference in green vitamin D which
vegetables were as such to speak of
empathy without understanding the effort
involved to overcome the impedance
provided by relative social privilege is
in a way of nonsense to quote her Eamonn
an empathy that is still built in social
privilege that does not force us to go
beyond our comfort zone to fully engage
with the user can often be an impediment
Justin Moore a professor of architecture
at Columbia University often talks about
the need to redesign the designer and he
talks about this in in two main contexts
one for us to seriously question and ask
ourselves like who gets to become
designers why it is that the pipeline is
so non diverse in spite of the fact that
often these designers are meant to be
designing for diverse if not fully
global populations part of his question
about how we redesign the designer also
asks about how exactly are we educating
and teaching designers to enable them to
holistically consider the needs of their
users and I think there&#39;s a third aspect
of this as well which ties into that not
only for those of us who are serious
about inclusive design might we also
start thinking about the way we can
actually distribute design knowledge
amongst the very communities we work
with but it also makes
question the depth of our own practices
how we are fully engaging and including
the user as we design systems which will
impact their everyday life and so if
empathy is not enough then what is
needed is a deliberate consistent and
embedded engagement with our users with
the other now someone might ask okay
hold on hold on hold on one does not
want to appear tokenistic and at this
point I urge everyone to almost take a
step back and really look at this sudden
little Isle of ours that breaks up the
Atlantic Ocean so hopefully and to
really consider the social inequalities
and paradigms that we exist in we exist
in a country where the black prison
population population is seven times
greater per per population and this is
interesting in comparison to someone
like the United States were only four
times well only four times we live in a
country where actually only five years
ago several major cities did a census
and some of them found that up to twenty
twenty three or higher thousand people
within their cities were actually
technically malnourished leaves as a
particular example we also live in a
country in a world where there are some
County some administrative regions where
the life expectancy differs by over a
decade this is the country we live in
and so our concerns about perhaps
appearing tokenistic or our concerns
about budget really pale in comparison
to the to the desperate desperate
divisions and issues that are at work
within our society as designers it is
key to remember empathy is not enough
what is needed is a consistent
engagement with the other and I will put
it monthly because
usually in design circles we tend to
speak driving euphemistically let me say
this whoever you are as a designer if
you&#39;re designing a product ensure that
it is at least tested and used and
considered in the context of someone as
different from you as possible if we
have to be that literal
so beer because that is what is needed
particularly in an age where our
technologies are designed environments
are becoming ever smarter ever more
sophisticated using reams of data which
we don&#39;t fully know where they come from
and gathering data form us in ways we
don&#39;t fully understand empathy is not
enough and quite frankly in the age of
AI and big data powered chat BOTS and in
an age where people are dreaming up
direct interfaces between human brains
and the internet and self-driving taxis
to Mars in an era of deep mind and deep
learning I think it&#39;s time that we
started designing a little bit deeper
thank you
