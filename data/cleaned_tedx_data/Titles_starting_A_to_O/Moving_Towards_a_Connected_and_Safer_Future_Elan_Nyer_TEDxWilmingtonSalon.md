meet Graham
gram is a physical 3d model designed in
Australia by a crash specialist an
artist and a surgeon demonstrating how
we would need to evolve as humans if we
were able to withstand high impact
crashes a few obvious features that you
can see is Graham skull he essentially
has a built-in helmet to protect his
brain the flatness of his face with
extra fatty tissue around his cheekbones
to protect his nose and the long-term
sinus effects associated with a broken
nose Graham doesn&#39;t get whiplash because
he doesn&#39;t have a neck and of course his
barrel-like chest with extremely thick
ribs and extra fatty tissue to protect
his vital organs
now unfortunately or fortunately
depending on how we look at it we&#39;re not
going to evolve to look like Graham
anytime soon because genetically we
evolve much slower than we do from a
cultural or from a societal perspective
since the first steam powered
locomotives in the early 19th century -
the first cars which gave us the freedom
to go wherever we want whenever we want
transportation has become an integral
part of our society the benefits of
modern day transportation and vehicle
travel are obvious to all of us but we
sometimes overlook is the high toll we
pay for this freedom globally over 1.3
million people die from car crashes
every single year in the US alone last
year 37 thousand four hundred and sixty
one thousand people died and more people
than the previous year we&#39;re headed in
the wrong direction to try to put this
into perspective from when I came to
this stage a few moments ago until I
finished this talk in just a few minutes
it is statistically likely that someone
will die in a car crash in the US alone
we need to fundamentally change the way
we think about safety up until this
point when we thought about safety it
has always been reactive how can we
assist or protect the driver and the
passengers at the point of impact how
can we assist them when they&#39;re in a
critical situation about to be in a
crash and we need to start thinking
proactively how can we prevent these
tuitions from occurring to begin with
right we don&#39;t want to get them in it we
don&#39;t want them to be in a difficult
situation and of course to prevent the
crash altogether well let&#39;s take a step
back and look at some other forms of
transportation
because it turns out that commercial air
travel and travel by trains are much
safer than getting in your car every
single day now what are some of the main
differences well
trains and planes are operated by
professionals my grandfather hasn&#39;t
driven in over 15 years and he can still
legally get in the car
he has a valid driver&#39;s license and go
drive down the street trains and planes
operate on schedule times and they have
predetermined routes and lastly they&#39;re
in touch with the control center that
acts as an additional pair of eyes for
them and keeps them connected at all
times when we look at the driving
environment you&#39;re a force you&#39;re forced
to operate in a confined chaotic
environment you&#39;re stuck on the road
there&#39;s nowhere else to go
you&#39;re stuck on your side of the road
and then when you add to that trying to
understand what the vehicle in front of
you is doing you have to use your
intuition you don&#39;t know what the next
movement they are going to make when you
add to that motorcyclists cyclists
pedestrians potholes to the mix you only
add fuel to the fire so what&#39;s the
solution on how we can begin to improve
safety today well if you have a newer
vehicle you might be lucky enough to
have some driver assistance features
built in such as a forward collision
warning or something like that
well that&#39;s really nice because that
gives you advanced warning of a crash
but you&#39;re limited to the line of sight
this driver has no clue what&#39;s going on
beyond the tractor trailer which means
that the maximum warning that can
receive is usually one maybe two seconds
autonomous vehicles are these going to
solve the situation yeah machines are
safer than humans because they don&#39;t get
distracted and feel the need to respond
to a text while they&#39;re driving or
change the radio station but with the
first autonomous vehicles hitting the
road in a few years from now and decades
for them to become commonplace it will
be irresponsible of us to rely on
autonomous
vehicles to be the answer to safety well
let&#39;s look to nature and see what we can
learn from there if you look up at a
flock of birds hundreds of birds flying
in the sky with beautiful formations and
turning at an instant 180 degrees you
don&#39;t see a few birds falling out of the
sky because they&#39;re bumping into each
other well
the secret is that birds communicate
with each other in real-time
they constantly send messages to the
closest Birds in their vicinity so that
they make sure they can operate safely
together they have evolved to drive safe
to fly safely together and what we can
do is we can try to mimic this on the
road we all share the road we all use
the road if we can use vehicle to
vehicle communication vehicle to
pedestrian vehicle to cyclist vehicle to
infrastructure and essentially get
everyone connected the more people that
join the network the safer it becomes
and it turns out that this is something
that is live today and we have live
vehicle to vehicle networks in San
Francisco Manhattan
tel aviv and rolling it out across the
state of nevada by using ubiquitous
technology smartphones turns out you can
use them for more than just looking at
funny and cute cat videos this
smartphone here is exponentially more
powerful than the computer used to send
the first person to the moon why not use
it to build a vehicle to vehicle
platform inside of every one of our
smartphones we have cameras those
cameras are connected to extremely
strong processors known as CPUs and GPUs
which allows us to have live computer
vision on the phone you have sensors
such as accelerometers and gyroscopes
which are extremely precise and accurate
and those allow you to understand the
movement of the vehicle and when you
combine these technologies add in GPS
and the fact that your phone is already
connected to a network
you have the ability from a single phone
to see feel the road and share that
information with relevant vehicles
around you
you can see on the top right over here
not only are we identifying vehicles the
type of vehicle your distance the angle
that they are the change in speed and of
course the exact movement of the vehicle
itself and when you combine all of this
information and you start sharing it on
the road all of a sudden we have a much
safer network you can share the
information if I know that you are
making a right-hand turn in 300 feet and
I happen to see a child in the road I
can let you know about that immediately
from the algorithms inside of my phone
if you are on a highway road that&#39;s one
lane in each direction instead of having
to veer out to see if you can pass why
not receive that message from the
vehicle in front of you that can see and
has a clear line of sight or from the
oncoming vehicle and if we go back to
the vehicle that we looked at before you
don&#39;t need to have that newer vehicle
because even if you don&#39;t have it you
probably have a smartphone in your
pocket and you can use that for driver
assistance features and to be connected
to the network so instead of having to
wait for this traffic for this
tractor-trailer to break you can receive
the message from five or six cars in
front of you saying hey you&#39;re gonna
have an emergency break in six seven
eight seconds from now start to break
less aggressively less chance of getting
hit from behind and if it&#39;s relevant why
not share that message with the vehicles
behind you as well and if we do that we
can take phones which are currently the
most dangerous device that you have in
the car with you and turn it into the
ultimate driving companion and by doing
so there&#39;s no need for us to evolve to
look like Graham
