our lives can change in an instant the
greatest thing to ever happen to us can
sometimes feel like the worst thing is
what&#39;s happening the greatest thing that
ever happened to me
is no different in the weeks leading up
to my 21st birthday I began to notice
some wording changes to my health
I remember feeling more and more tired I
felt as if I needed to rest when doing
activities I ordinarily wouldn&#39;t need to
I remember my boss telling me I looked
pale and my friends and family would
tell me the same the more you hear
things like that the more you listen and
the scarier it gets after a while I
began to notice that something was
really wrong so I went to a local
pharmacy to check my pulse with a
blood-pressure cuff my vitals were all
normal but the next day an enormous
bruise encircled my arm right where the
blood pressure cuff had been I couldn&#39;t
understand what was happening to me and
without insurance I didn&#39;t know what to
do I woke up one day with the intention
of going to work but I quickly realized
this was going to be impossible I
couldn&#39;t walk six steps without passing
out so I called out of work and then
called my mom to drive me to the
emergency room they wheeled me inside
took a blood sample and then gave me the
news that would change my life forever
on October 3rd 2011 I was diagnosed with
cancer leukemia I&#39;ll never be able to
explain the feeling I felt when they
uttered those words but I&#39;m here today
to tell you that getting cancer was the
best thing to ever happen to me two days
after my diagnosis Apple CEO Steve Jobs
passed away from pancreatic cancer I
remember sitting on my hospital bed and
watching a documentary about his life
and I was amazed to see all the
wonderful things he did for the world
the innovations his company set into
motion and how he helped push humanity
forward I admired that and I aspired to
be like that
so after the documentary aired and a few
moments of reflection I promised myself
that if I was going to somehow survive I
was going to do something I didn&#39;t know
what but I promised myself that if I was
going to live I would work for the rest
of my life to make this world as great
as I believe it can be a few days passed
and I figured it&#39;s probably time to
break the news to my friends and as a
millennial guess what
I chose Facebook the reaction I got I
never expected people are so caring and
shows so much support people I hadn&#39;t
talked to in years called me and
messaged me saying if there&#39;s anything
they could do to help for me to just ask
I told some of my friends how I didn&#39;t
have insurance and they began to find
ways to help me a friend of my sister
got her sorority sisters together to
make insel bracelets at their college
and this helped me so much but what I
found so fascinating about this is that
these people didn&#39;t know me all they
knew is someone needed help and because
of Facebook and the human need to
connect they found a cause worth
supporting my cause after some time went
on enough people had shared my Facebook
post that basically my whole town knew
what was happening to me and people all
over were trying to find ways to help me
a friend of my brother got local bands
together to organize a concert open to
the entire community and in the course
of two days they raised over two
thousand dollars to help me pay for my
medical bills and this was wonderful and
it helped but again think about this
these people had never met me before in
their lives all they knew is someone in
their community needed help and so they
did to me this says there&#39;s a hidden
power in our communities an untapped
resource just begging to be released if
only we could get this resource to the
people who need it most after some time
it was pretty evident that chemotherapy
wasn&#39;t working and I faced a bone-marrow
transplant luckily
I have a lot of siblings but one after
the other were tested and we&#39;re coming
up- doesn&#39;t match and it got down to my
older brother at this point I really
thought this was going to be the end for
me but I was wrong my brother was not
only a match he was in a hundred percent
match I got my life back I survived but
things were different I stopped seeing
barriers and I realized that if I can
take chemotherapy biopsies surgeries
there&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do
someone once told me you never know how
strong you are until being strong is all
you have a changed I got into school and
I resumed my life but I never forgot how
my community helped me and I never for a
second forgot the promise I made myself
the day Steve Jobs passed away they say
there&#39;s six degrees of separation
between any two people on the planet and
that&#39;s true and all that means is
between you and anyone else there are at
most six other people between you and
them a friend of a friend of a friend
the idea that we&#39;re all separated by six
people first comes from a short story
written in 1929 it was popularized by
the play six degrees of separation by
John Gorrie in the 90s and it was
actually proven by a Columbia University
professor in 2001 and to see how a
simple Facebook post can reach so many
people it was proven to me I bring this
up because during my time in college I
began to formulate an idea what if there
weren&#39;t six degrees of separation
between us what if there was zero and
what if we could digitize how my
community helped me I met Dominik Gregor
and my entrepreneurship class and we
began developing an application that
would be capable of doing just that we
asked ourselves what if people could
post a status not just to their friends
but to everyone within a ten-mile radius
what if we could change the way we meet
people by having our city right in our
pocket we are captivated by the
possibilities of such an app
and so we built it and we named it
Brighton you can think of bright as
community networking an open social
media not focused on just a friends list
but on your entire city we want to
eliminate segregation created by our
social circles and create truly
connected communities if I had had
bright when I was sick I wouldn&#39;t have
had to wait for friends of friends to
find out with one simple post everyone
within a 10-mile radius would have known
at once and I could have gotten the help
that I needed much faster my dream is
that this application will help others
in the way that I was helped by my
community I believe all of us have the
power to make a difference in the world
Steve Jobs once said the world was
created by people no smarter than you
you can change it and those people crazy
enough to believe they can change the
world are the ones that - personally I
don&#39;t think social media is good or evil
I think it&#39;s how we use it that matters
most I survived one of the worst things
that can happen to a person but I lived
because of people like I said cancer was
the best thing to ever happen to me
because it taught me that a life
connected to others is the happiest life
a person can live and in this age of
social media connecting with others is
the brightest thing a person can do so
get out there connect share and make a
difference thank you
you
