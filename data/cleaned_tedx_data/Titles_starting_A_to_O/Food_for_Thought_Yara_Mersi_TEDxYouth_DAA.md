and we were talking about how busy
people are and about creating include
people in fact my father wanted to have
a spaghetti on as a flip though because
he hates me all time rush or maybe it
would solve the kitchen mess and make my
mom in fact I might before every but
about Rob record a software engineer in
San Francisco who recently decided to
switch from food to blended shakes
maybe that means food service and yet
continuing all the nutrients you miss me
so it is possible well the next day I
found out that it&#39;s actually happening
scientists have been working on creating
easy simple
now imagine eating this a little rounded
tablet for breakfast lunch and dinner it
will provide you with all the parts
faxes protein you need for the entire
day it will help you maintain your
weight and stay healthy and that has all
the nutrients and minerals
you will need would you think well I
hope you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s crazy isn&#39;t
it
is this what our world our future food
systems our approach has come to this is
ridiculous
to me this kills a joyously there&#39;s a
great confusion with trying to be
healthy it&#39;s obsessive damaging yourself
because food is more than just nutrients
but a lot of us don&#39;t see it that way
especially because of the large amount
of Fanta
has been today there is the Paleo diet a
high protein diet went to the entire
Mediterranean side of the hcg that you
needed and so Adam lavender is also the
low-fat diet and so my heart would bite
97% factory Mayo will change anything
believing it was bad for humans
sugar-free severe for calorie and us
healthy but she was wrong we are over
confusing with topic we noticed because
the number of people on a diet is going
yeah obesity levels and public health
spending continue to rise alarming and
whose to really blame well but first and
foremost is the food industry portrayed
in the media then come celebrate
innocent and finally ourselves first the
food industry is the biggest one alcohol
the food industry thrive on confusion
and mostly misplaced to the media the
media reports on which diet is better
are constantly changing and these
contradicting reports can cause
confusion and leave people to yo-yo
dieting which is trying every fad diet
in order to find something that will
help them lose weight but then weakening
it by eating again and then used to and
then starting all over on top of that
food companies today are setting up
institutes such as coca-cola the
beverage Institute for Health and
Wellness that essentially tries to bring
these companies products as helpful and
in the case of soda no way front welcome
another perspective
in fact coca-cola funded scientists
whose just blame for obesity away from
bad diets saying it&#39;s only to do with
exercise or even the Gatorade Sports
Science Institute has papers explaining
why David is better than water for
exercise to make matters more confusing
these Institute&#39;s appoint health
professionals including doctors
cardiologists and dietitians
to tell the public about the products
benefits most time to denote public is
not
this is God objective health
professional choosing LeSabre in
addition it does not help when the media
tries to focus on celebrities their
looks and what they eat which is a
common issue with the coverage of Miley
Cyrus another popular celebrity that
endorses with gluten free diet - Cyrus
convulsively and free diet we gotta back
it up with any scientific information
only her apparent results this just
gives us a diet a bigger audience at her
trying to see how rich she looks or how
the figures of every look and they see
what they do to achieve that look and it
can lead them to following on her diet
and carrying bodies and even more
confusion and it&#39;s not only with Miley
Cyrus but Kim Kardashian endorses the
app inside Megan Fox a paleo diet and
even the famous Victoria Secret model
Miranda Kerr annoying the best day it&#39;s
many more do this second along with the
food industry the other journalism is
debated for causing his confusion on
food what&#39;s not a perfect idea and so
forth simply misguidance
the nature of journalism and the nature
of food don&#39;t make a good fit food is
old the real foods are the same ones
who&#39;ve been eating over many thousands
of years but yellow journalism which is
a type of journalism that presents
little or no legitimate well researched
news and instead uses I catchy headlines
and inaccurate information to sell more
newspapers and magazines and so they
need a new story every week and we do
know the possible methods real
combustibles but how are you going to
interest the editor in that story
therefore again the food industry I want
you to know what the blue areas and that
there is very excite
research so I had a super this dude&#39;s
both journalism which is the new story
every week and the food industry which
retired about 15,000 new products every
year and now what&#39;s eating this old
yellow journalism is negative
advertising you probably don&#39;t know what
it is but you have double sleeper
subjects with me is advertising are as
that looks like the content knee
replacement so indirectly which means
that it&#39;s the problem because now we
can&#39;t completely identify or avoid gun
as accomplished within the concept with
this spirit possibly being tempted to
learn surprising secrets of weight loss
or is the only through the hub we keep
healthy or prevent cancer further
fueling the confusion of misguidance for
example of this particle manages
mentioning the ultimate benefits of
cranberry juice and how it can help
community I was actually sponsored by
Ocean Spray the producers of cranberry
juice finally third complain is our
stops I believe we have forgotten hot to
be because we are so bombarded by mass
media night that were unfortunately
confused the celebrities with their diet
pills and local remedies further amplify
this madness we are also easily
influenced to the power of the word
natural which drives sales even though
we although it&#39;s meaningless we see this
from the makers of Caprice on Snapple
and 7up tried to stop on the word
natural on the product recently but
we&#39;re throwing the waffles and then
scramble to change cultivators it&#39;s just
one of those planes up makes people feel
better about the food ad but really
means
nothing at all why let&#39;s check out a few
of these frequently used food additives
that qualify as all-natural cysteine
found in human hair and duck feathers
using vacance secretion the female Lac
bug is the next vagina
Jochen abidos is the color food
beverages rep so the bottom line is that
the food industry because I want you
were I to know the more choose and what
we&#39;re really consuming because that can
hurt your business and it so it&#39;s back
to us we are so gullible and haven&#39;t
stuck to the basic lessons we knew
already such as cooking your own food
controlling our sugar intake we read a
magazine or watching Adam to be it
simply believed everything in sight we
have become so naive listen we believe
we just regurgitate it&#39;s not only the
media and the other journalism but also
ourselves so the food industry the gala
journalism and ourselves have
successfully we make our own dreams and
so now it may seem like we&#39;re played -
apparently Hooton is not feeling
austerities making this acidic cesspool
tea makes us live longer carbs are
necessary but not should be avoided
that&#39;s major spot hope you know all the
ways it&#39;s beautiful and then it&#39;s not
forget we must never gives you animal
products ever again because our tens of
times we own ancestors were nomads
really Apple products and never had
is this sounding a little familiar and
hopefully a very absurd where do we turn
to legitimate advice who can you trust
what can you do
we must end this confusion and
complication and bring back your dream
again I will never forget the aroma of
my mom&#39;s carrot cake filling the house
were entering with pushing victories
with the irresistible smell of the fresh
honey each back in Lebanon or the
delicious pinata and which we would all
gather and eat with my family whenever
we would visit Spain
the point is food it&#39;s more than just
your chance even when were alone
we share this food on social media and
so we&#39;re deliberately invited other
people to participate in our eating
experience and so the issue is that the
food industry and the yellow journalism
have influenced us destroying some of
those things I&#39;m pretty sure we were all
fun and healthy with no issues backing
abilities because even I got my thunder
Lebanon often these help me even if you
didn&#39;t know much about nutrition it&#39;s
because eating plants and animals rather
than eating mostly package so we made of
sunflower oil and a long list of
ingredients is a healthier diet not a
regimen that changes within the seasons
but a way of life we must end this
confusion and complication and bring
back your daily eating who said health
and happiness has to be mutually
exclusive and why should we observe
everything we hear from the media and
the food industry after all I believe
that our health is as simple or as
complicated as we making despite the
apparent confusion there are very clear
messages coming out and that is about
eating Whole Foods if we really want to
change our relationships with food I
need your help we need to give up on all
those quick fixes and pull the shades
and everything I said
for us without us panicked but in any
error and we&#39;ve got to go back to eat
real whether or not you choose to add a
meat or other animal products as long as
you have those for all four foundations
into it and finally with both to
remember that what works for you may not
work for someone else
nutrition is never a one-size-fits-all
science so therefore we should not
object our health of Trent and regard
food as more than the nutrients it
contains rather it is part of our social
connection our culture and a great
source of pleasure in life I leave it to
you
