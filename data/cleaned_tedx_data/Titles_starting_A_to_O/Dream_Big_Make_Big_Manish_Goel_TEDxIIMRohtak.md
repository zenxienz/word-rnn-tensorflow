to begin with I would say I&#39;m not a body
vation speaker
but I&#39;m a self-motivated man 24 into
seven 365 days and sometime 366 days
when it&#39;s only cause I make sure I don&#39;t
even spare that day that&#39;s been like
this forever
and you know actors I perceived to be
this melodramatic drama Kings drama
queens so muchi bowler Yankees are up

really have to go and look into the
references of other YouTube videos or
some other quotes inspirational quotes
from other autobiographies or anything
why you normally put is in the game or
are these in the gear put is Andy key
let&#39;s say to speaker there are openly
money manacles idea though might not be
myself I don&#39;t want to be managed coil
the actor again I want to be Manish coil
myself and what I bring to you today
this morning is Manish Goyal myself I&#39;m
going to tell you a story of a boy so
sometimes you get inspired by something
in life there&#39;s a trigger point in your
life right and I got inspired by this
boy and this boy is the boy who
motivates me 24 by 7 365 days as I said
the carny here 1975 26 August 1245 oz
midnight this cute little baby was born
12 pounds fare as as you can think I
mean every knows just wanted to bounce
at him they wanted to play with him be
with him parents were so happy that mas
fee was very happy you know of course he
was as good-looking as a Instagram
sensation right now mr. Taymor Ali Khan
- the color of his eyes of course but
exactly three days later 72 hours this
little baby was reduced to a skeleton
every bone of his body was visible the
doctors went to the parents and they
said I think you should go back without
him
because he is not going to survive more
than seven days when you know parents
are parents there&#39;s no boss
we got to give all what we have you give
what you have and let this baby give
whatever he has the process began
obviously medical was not that advanced
that time and the medication started
twenty-one injections a day in that
little baby&#39;s body my new twenty-one
injections and he was treated by the
direct sunlight the process went on the
parents went to the temples churches
everywhere it began and began it began
and one fine day one fine morning the
doctors came up to these parents and
they said guess what he has a life he
will survive and he will live like just
the way other kids do and will and that
force the lock stock and barrel movement
for those parents because give whatever
they had in them and they got back
whatever they wanted and that&#39;s what
locks rocket barrel is about basically
give yourself complete and when you give
yourself bleed you get what you back
what you want well the why moved on he
lived he survived of course yeah but he
was not that good-looking now but tiga I
mean that&#39;s fine he was an average
looking boy he got his life back but
there was a problem the problem was at
the age of nine he told his parents at
the age of nine that I want to become a
hero
he was very clear he did our inter
school competition he won a small little
prize and a trophy for it and he came
back to his mom he said ma the only
thing I believed I would have become as
an actor or hero you know for mother
you&#39;re the most good-looking son she
looked at him and he said of course you
will and he announced that to this
entire school and obviously he was made
fun of because of the way he looked he
was given few names
he was never called by his name he was
called by names like pygmy a negro an
orang utan and trust me he was
synonymous to all these because he
looked like that but he wanted to become
a hero and whenever he told them he
would be made fun of so he decided to
have a larger audience he started
participating in all the school
activities drama sports everywhere
obviously in the beginning he didn&#39;t
really win the medals but he kept
participating hit went going on and on
and on and finally a day came and he
started winning and winning became his
habit and he kept winning winning
winning winning he won that audience but
he didn&#39;t win that little group of his
that little group was a one who was his
best friends and they were the ones who
gave him these names that really really
hurt him and he went into depression he
was that was with anti-depression
tablets and that&#39;s when his mother told
him the story of the little boy who
survived little baby and that was him
and she said you&#39;re blessed with that
quality to find you gonna win that
audience come what may and he started on
and a day came and there were fable of
the same school and this boy won the
Sword of Honour the best student and
this principal comes up to me and says
ok let&#39;s say a few words come on
guru address he looked at a little
audience and he said please listen to us
he said even blacks BL e ck s can do it
and he broke down he beeped and guess
what happens that little audience then
group of his comes to him and he says
you know what we&#39;ve lost a lot of time
with you probably will not meet up so
let&#39;s celebrate let&#39;s be together and
let&#39;s just enjoy this night or do we
don&#39;t know when you see you and he
called his my knee said ma finally I
have won this group and I&#39;m with them
and that was his lock stock and barrel
moment because he gave whatever he had
and he caught back water
wanted that&#39;s what his locks talkin
batted right guys well moving on he
didn&#39;t stop there he wrote a book of his
dreams and he went to his spare and he
said you know these are my dreams and I
want to fulfill them and for that I need
to go to the city of my dreams they
looked at him and they said why not
go you will and he went on he had all
the luxuries in his life but he left it
all he went to his city of dreams he
struggled his way out he pushed the
envelope because he wanted to be a hero
I met the personality he had it was very
tough so he had all the rejections
because of the way he looked he was
actually told that there&#39;s no rule for
this particular race the black race why
a hero can never be a black guy sad but
that is what the fact was so he said I&#39;m
going to fight it out he started working
on himself he said I don&#39;t know how to
look fair he called up his mother and
she said based on use code they use
could you Picaro you will you will get
your persona back but keep fighting and
he went on and on and on and if I could
crash goes his journey he said ok
beggars are not to just let&#39;s begin and
he started off as a junior a crowd actor
he became a character actor then a
better character actor and one fine
morning he got a call from the major g&#39;s
channel telling him that you are going
to be the hero of a next big show and he
became the hero of the next big show on
one of the leading channels of india and
posted that show became such a huge a
that was that with every show he was a
hero and one day he became the national
hero on Indian television when this
journalist called him up and asked him
that dude today or the national hero
what is I mean there&#39;s something you
want to give a message out what caught
you here what&#39;s your journey like he
said you know what
I gave whatever I had and I kept giving
it every day of my life every time I
faced the rejection I kept giving it
kept giving
and finally it is reciprocated and that
was his lock stock and barrel woman
cries it clearly says that whenever you
give you a hundred person it has to come
back to you but if you give 99 it will
not come back to you so he was right at
the speaker that this peak but life is
full of surprises you see it&#39;s always
full of surprises he had much more to
achieve he could have easily said okay
fine I reached here big deal but no he
opened his book of dreams and he said
Wow
there&#39;s much more because every time he
checklist with one of his dream he wrote
two more and then suddenly his roller
coaster came crashing down to the ground
zero he was again left secluded isolated
fallen back but this time along with his
two kids and his wife he divided his
entire life and he said have always done
it so why not now he opened up his book
of dreams again he said there is so much
to achieve and I will he woke up the
next morning he looked out in the sky
and he said hey life you know what
I&#39;ll buy the ticket to the roller
coaster again so let&#39;s ride again
let&#39;s ride again and this morning every
morning I&#39;ve been telling myself
let&#39;s ride again because that little boy
who survived that boy who won the little
group that boy who became a hero and
that guy who clashed land is actually me
Manny squirrel
so last four years last four years the
all the only thing I mean hearing is a
no-no here some people say key art
monition time is over go back now and
every time they see that I said no dude
my time is just begun failure after
failure failure after failure after
establishing myself as one of the best
actor on Indian television I have given
100 auditions and fielded in last three
years but every time I failed I rose up
the next morning and I told myself it&#39;s
not about the failure of those 100
auditions it&#39;s about surviving that one
audition and while I&#39;m standing here I
have survived that one audition and I&#39;m
back I&#39;m actually back but you know what
my book of dreams is a book of dreams
there are too many dreams left so guys
every time he woke up in the morning
every time I wake up in the morning the
only two choices in life only two
choices please remember that please
listen to us carefully the only two
choices one is to give up and one is to
fight there&#39;s nothing in between because
the moon you go in between it&#39;s a tomb
so every morning I wake up and I tell
myself dude fight this morning I woke up
and I told myself
let&#39;s fight because this moment is my
lock stock and barrel movement where I
am giving whatever have envy to all you
guys for you to inspire and go out and
achieve whatever dreams you want to
because you go to be the same witness to
the day when I&#39;m going to be the man of
my dreams to this entire world and that
day will come and that moment that
moment will happen because I have
challenged none other than God guys I
have challenged none other than God
telling him that if you don&#39;t check list
all my dreams before you open your doors
to me
if I could take my life back from you
when I was a baby I would take it back
again come down and achieve all my
dreams and then be the man of my dreams
and that would be minor Gendry lock
stock and barrel moment for me so guys
take a book write your dreams and if
destiny doesn&#39;t support it fight it
fight it because destiny boughs down to
those people who fight whoever hunger
who believe in themselves standing right
here I can tell you that that I&#39;ve seen
that journey I am seeing it again I have
started from the scratch but it&#39;s okay

the top and sanneya I could tell you I
will so guys I came here with the
thought that I&#39;m going to hit a century
