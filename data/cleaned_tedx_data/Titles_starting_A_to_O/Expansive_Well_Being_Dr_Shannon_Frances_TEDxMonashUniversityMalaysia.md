I wanna ask you how do you feel how did
you feel when you woke up this morning
sad it was too early right I tired maybe
a little bit stressed out right now I
want to ask by show of hands let&#39;s see
how many people when you woke up this
morning you felt the best you ever had
it was like the best day of your life
show the hands Hey good on you the one
guy um for the rest of us you know maybe
there&#39;s some room for improvement if we
look at the statistics for Malaysia with
a group this size there&#39;s gonna be
several people here who are suffering
from at least mild depression there are
gonna be people here who have been
recently diagnosed with serious diseases
like diabetes or have the disease and
they don&#39;t know it yet
what about not so like more mundane
problems like relationship problems like
trouble at work what about that vague
dissatisfaction that prevents you from
enjoying the things that you have in
your life so think back to how you felt
the way this morning when you woke up
how many people would like to wake up
tomorrow morning feeling better who
wants to feel better see that&#39;s what I&#39;m
talking about the reason why I asked
about how you felt this morning is
because most people have kind of a
baseline feeling sort of a baseline
well-being right this can last for days
weeks sometimes even years now when you
think about it you kind of wake up in a
similar mood every morning maybe
something good happens and you get all
excited but then it wears off right you
go back to your baseline or something
really bad happens even serious tragedy
it takes a while but you get over it and
you come back to your baseline the good
news is this baseline can be changed we
can raise that baseline so that we can
all
feel a little bit healthier and a little
bit happier good news right
it&#39;s also extremely important news the
reason why it&#39;s important is because
when we feel good like when we feel
really good in our body we feel our best
we think more clearly right we learn
more quickly when we have to do
troubleshooting or problem-solving we
come up with more and more creative
solutions we are kinder and more
compassionate people
so feeling good you can think of it as
being an avenue to becoming the best
person you can be this is really
important right now
think about the crises and the troubles
the challenges that we&#39;re facing think
about the things that people talked in
that the previous TED talks are horrible
things are happening in the world
what about Peak Oil what about climate
change mass extinction global economy
now I don&#39;t know what the future is
gonna bring I can&#39;t I can&#39;t even guess
but I can tell you it is for sure gonna
be different than the way we live our
lives now and what we need right now is
as many clever clear headed clear
thinking people out there on the ground
coming up with solutions they need to
think about their problems they need to
change their mindset they need to
communicate those solutions to other
people and work with other people to
find a way of living that helps us in
the future so let&#39;s think about why
don&#39;t we feel better than we do why when
we have literally hundreds of thousands
of self-help books that give us
step-by-step instructions and how to be
happy and healthier why are we as
individuals not happier why when we&#39;ve
had amazing teachers who teach us how to
live a good life like the Prophet
Muhammad like Jesus like Buddha right
why would we have
documents of enormous wisdom like the
Torah and going back thousands of years
to evade us why as a population aren&#39;t
we doing better why I asked you why when
we already have so many TED talks
why don&#39;t we feel better I&#39;ll tell you
why I think we don&#39;t feel better it&#39;s
because it&#39;s hard at any time you want
to raise that baseline you want to move
away from something that&#39;s comfortable
or maybe just familiar it&#39;s really hard
it takes effort and you know we&#39;re like
a little bit kind of hazy easily
distracted hey it takes time and we&#39;re
impatient and the worst thing is we have
to do it ourselves it&#39;s our minds it&#39;s
our bodies we have to think for
ourselves and you guys are all pretty
clever ought to talk to a lot of really
clever people today but if you want to
take your thinking for yourself to the
next level it can be a little bit scary
so let me give you an example a friend
of mine she watched both of her parents
die long slow painful early deaths
largely due to the lifestyle choices
that they made she&#39;s scared she doesn&#39;t
want to go this way so she tries to take
care of her health but the problem is
she has a stressful job and she works
long hours and sometimes she&#39;s hungry
and so she goes to a vending machine and
she buys a handful of candy bars for
lunch now ironically she does work in
patient care eating a candy bar for
lunch she tries to be better she
struggles to eat more fruits and
vegetables because she knows it works it
makes her feel better when she does
right but you know it&#39;s inconvenient
here&#39;s her constipation and before you
know it she&#39;s hungry she&#39;s standing in
front of that vending machine with a
pocketful of
and to top it off she knows that every
time she buys packaged processed food
that contained palm oil she is in some
small way paying somebody burned down a
bit of the rainforest somewhere in the
world so it&#39;s hard
we all struggle maybe you have different
issues than she does but everybody
struggles it&#39;s difficult because on the
one hand it&#39;s very personal but it&#39;s so
global on one hand it&#39;s very simple but
it&#39;s also very complex right why can&#39;t
she just eat one apple per day right I
mean how hard is that one you know
organic apple per day you know one
organic apple from a sustainable farm
grown locally where they pay the Apple
pickers a decent wage but isn&#39;t too
expensive how hard is that when we face
these personal challenges we have to
have persistence diligence and courage
okay this is a party that&#39;s really
important to me persistence diligence
and courage now because I want you guys
to remember it I want you to say it with
me one time okay ready
persistence diligence and courage okay
maybe have all three right maybe you
have a little bit of courage and some
diligence right with you can take the
next step right maybe you can have one
more healthy meal per week or you can
start walking or if you already walk
maybe you can go a little bit further or
a little bit faster
what about get more sleep what about
spend less money so I want to give you a
few more examples these are people that
I actually know friends of mine once
upon a time there was a little boy and
he had to learn French and English in
his school these are not his native
languages
he wondered why he was working so hard
to learn these languages when the only
people that he knew that spoke these
languages were his teachers so rather
than waste his time
he got on his bike and he rode the
several kilometers to the local tourist
attraction where there were foreign
guests and he started to greet them in
their own languages and before you know
it they were talking with him in their
language they were asking him about his
history his culture and he could answer
and before long he was giving guide
tours he was making money because he
learned French and English alright so
what did he do with that money well a
lot of kids his age at this time we&#39;re
buying guns and selling drugs to get
rich quick so what did my friend do he
bought piglets little baby pigs and to
his village which was a poor rice
farming village they didn&#39;t even make
enough for themselves so they didn&#39;t
have money for things like electricity
vehicles and he gave these pigs to his
villagers his neighbors and he said if
you take care of these pigs and they
grow large enough that we can sell them
for slaughter you pay me the original
price of the pig and you can keep the
rest of the money this guy because he
had the courage to talk to people who
were different than him and a language
he wasn&#39;t sure of ensured his own
livelihood and the livelihood of his
village that&#39;s courage okay so let me
tell you a story about another guy with
a very different background this guy is
pretty well educated very very clever in
fact he got a job at the EU at a very
prestigious institution right you&#39;re all
thinking not bad for a Malaysian guy huh
hey the thing is he hated his job he
felt it was sucking the soul out of his
life so what did he do he bought stuff
you know stuff for the house toys you
just bought stuff and in fact he bought
so much stuff that he got into debt so
what did he need then he bought more
stuff and but though he I mean he was a
clever guy he is a clever guy so he
figured it out this can&#39;t keep going on
this way so what he did is he made a
budget and even though it was really
super hard he stayed on his budget and
he got out of debt so he could quit his
stupid job and now he has a new job and
it&#39;s much less stressful so now he has
the energy to follow his passions which
is great he likes to do electronics
and right now he&#39;s come he&#39;s currently
developing small sustainable solar water
powered systems to help urban gardeners
with say aquaponics right the thing is
because these are standalone and
affordable that means that somebody
could use this as a product somewhere in
the developing world where people don&#39;t
have electricity they could use it to
charge a handphone or maybe each other
so that OH
so that a child could study for an hour
extra in the evening so this guy took
care of himself so well because of his
persistence and sticking on a budget
he&#39;s actually in a position to help a
lot of other people too now two women
that I know they also had prestigious
jobs they were making a lot of money
they had the respect and admiration of
their families and they hated their jobs
they felt that their jobs were
meaningless and they wanted to do
something meaningful so they quit their
stupid jobs and they got a piece of land
and they started on Orkut now I asked
you who in their right mind starts an
organic farm in Malaysia first of all if
you grow palm oil you can make a whole
bunch of money a lot more than fruits
and vegetables and secondly it&#39;s a lot
of hard work it takes years to convert
so these women worked really really hard
and
after a few years they were selling
organic vegetables they are putting
healthy organic food on the plates of
Malaysian families and they are
single-handedly dealing with the issue
of food security in Malaysia these
people all have what I call expansive
well-being they take care of themselves
so well that they happen to do good in
the world they help the people around
them so that&#39;s why I encourage you to
think about the horrendous faith we have
horrendous challenges but we have
amazing resources right we have abundant
cheap oil now think of the
infrastructure that we can build now to
help us live well when the oil isn&#39;t
there we have telecommunications we can
meet like-minded people all over the
world make community and start changing
social institutions and behaviors so
that we can not only adjust to the
future but maybe even live better lives
we have access to millions and millions
of documents of information and
knowledge from thousands and thousands
of years why don&#39;t we use this why don&#39;t
we use these resources and maybe if we
work at it we can get a little bit of
improvement and if we keep working at it
maybe it can get a little bit easier in
some small way we can save the world
I mean it&#39;s outrageous isn&#39;t it if you
know what&#39;s going on in the world how
can anybody be talking about saving the
world but I admit it I want to save the
world if I could I would save the world
who else feels that way who wants to
save the world
who wants to say that I look at that you
guys are an amazing resource your
education your connections your ability
to communicate I&#39;ve heard so many
excellent ideas from the students where
the talks are brilliant but you guys are
a huge resource you know so I encourage
you please
take care of the world which is our home
take care of the people around you who
is our family I urge you to share the
good things that you are your talents
your passions your abundance but in
order to do these and as a prerequisite
I ask you please take care of yourselves
thank you
