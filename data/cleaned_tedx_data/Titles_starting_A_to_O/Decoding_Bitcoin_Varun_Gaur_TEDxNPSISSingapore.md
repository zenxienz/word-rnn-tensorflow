it begins as a show of hands how many of
you guys have heard the words Bitcoin or
blocking okay 90% of the audience of it
how many of you guys know what bitcoin
of the block it is okay that&#39;s about 10%
how many you guys currently own Bitcoin
yes that&#39;s very interesting so with
so when I was a young boy I was very
interested with the concept of money the
idea this is one thing that people that
poor people live for people wait for is
for people make their life and so lack
news
so one day I&#39;m playing we see already
that so I give my paypal email
Blaze&#39;s for anything on the phone that
was a kid
I think what do you he says Bitcoin I&#39;ll
keep it going through you Mike that&#39;s it
okay that is how the world with the most
beautiful technology to come about since
these in case you guys are wondering
[Music]

which means this happen diversity and
there could be unlimited lead generating
massive gold stored it to the papers
this is money now I&#39;ve heard people were
wearing my shirt should we use this as
the money eventually it became cell
phone finally the next
and in the plastic we now start using
credit cards and debit cards lastly were
on the verge of the biggest shift to
digital currency this is where Bitcoin
content so let me introduce you to
Bitcoin in 2009 publishes a white paper
under secure form completely
decentralized completely trust lists
each coin is mathematically scarce
bitcoin is the only scary car today
there is when you have cash inflation
but if you ask the venezuelan a
brazilian an Argentinian their money is
constantly explaining and losing
purchasing power
what about gold you say gold must be
scarce right there company 20 million
people developing ways to travel you can
turn other elements
the author of Bitcoin locked in at 21
million there can only ever be 21
million bitcoins ever created this into
the price called the deflationary curve
now what is so special about
decentralization why should I care to
understand how the blockchain works
so now I&#39;m going to explain how the
blockchain works in very simple terms
let&#39;s imagine a world where every is not
physical money is soaking so I buy
cookies in the canteen I go to the LPNs
say I&#39;m how many with you $1 and she
gives me for me it seems easy right but
where does the problem committee the
problem is known in computer science has
doubled spending spending money keeping
our power I can easily go to the RPM say
I&#39;m now giving you 1 million dollars
it would be great but in practical sense
so we need someone where does the
problem here the problem of
centralization the trust you invested at
one person means that this one tricks
has the power to edit the history of
money
this person can give himself believe the
daughter this person can take away
billions of dollars this person is gonna
rewrite the history of what if there was
not one Christian what if there were
10,000 people right and everything
what is it when I told the enemy I am
now giving you one dollar ten thousand
people look at this and they write it
down in your book and this is a
validated exception each other to make
sure that everything checks out so this
is why it can be used not only for money
it can be used for storing they cannot
be lost it can be used for small
contracts it can be used for fair
elections and there are there other to
talk about so now I&#39;m going to why
should you care of a point don&#39;t you
already
Thanks the thing is people and I simply
glorified Ledger&#39;s when you deposit
money with go back the other number into
your account this is not your onion it
belongs to the back this means in the
bathroom toilet whenever they like let&#39;s
say hypothetically I $100 to my cousin
in India so I&#39;m going to go to the back
someday
they say sorry we&#39;re closed
can you come back a different day so
office to light
sorry we&#39;re only open from nine to five
and you come back in a different time so

I go at 4:30 p.m. and your passport in
your ID token count so I got that part
so I&#39;m happy
and then they say wait you&#39;re 15 years
old you need your mom to be with you
so I call my mom with me and then they
say okay great
and I say our deposit $2,000 they say
sorry first week your limit is $500 so I
put it in
and now he needs to like a bank account
and it is blue too long-winded process
which takes an insane amount of time the
three of pregnant
with police but it&#39;s been two months
when you have so much trust and so much
power into one single entity they abuse
it the constrictions it with barrier
entry about you like a human the one for
another dog
whoever&#39;s at the top has all the power
bitcoin is a flat plane whether you are
the president of the USA or your
students make coin 3 see you at the
people you can build apps you can
transfer millions of dollars across the
country for five cents Bitcoin doesn&#39;t
care who you are what happens it point
in quite well with Bitcoin money from an
ATM without limits I can play with
selves on the subject exactly invest in
Facebook and Apple using Bitcoin without
any limits but no
bitcoin gives me financial freedom $100
I put in a couple of years ago doesn&#39;t
have enough of course that was no jaqen
probably about half the width which I
didn&#39;t if you use Bitcoin allows you
money in a way that you&#39;ve never seen
before
you actually get to control your 20 so
for anyone who is interested
I&#39;m gonna demonstrate the transaction
for you please come to me I&#39;ll be happy
to send you into this into a tree form
it goes now $20,000 so I thank you for
listening
