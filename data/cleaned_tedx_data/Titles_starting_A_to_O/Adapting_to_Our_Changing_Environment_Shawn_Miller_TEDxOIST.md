so I grew up as a dependent of an active
duty service member my family and I
traveled the world and we moved around
often and out all the places that I
lived okey now Japan was by far my
favorite it gave me this natural
comforting sense of home I knew one day
that I had to get back eventually in
1998 my journey brought me back here and
I&#39;ve been here ever since
okay now as a sub tropical paradise with
warm weather and beautiful beaches it
has some of the best scuba diving in the
world and the people are some of the
kindest people you ever meet it&#39;s also
rich in nature scenery as well and we
have a variety of endemic species that
are only found in the northern part of
Okinawa in the ya&#39;muru forest now in
2010 I got heavily involved in
documenting the animals of the riyuku
Islands primarily focusing on wildlife
conservation as well as the protection
of endangered species
June 10th 2010 a friend and I were
exploring central Okinawa we stumbled
upon a terrestrial hermit crab that was
adapting with her waist and when I saw
this I was absolutely amazed because
I&#39;ve never seen anything like this
before I had to take a second look it&#39;s
like something like we discovered a new
species or something absolutely amazing
and so of course I took multiple
photographs of it and on the drive home
all I could think about was this hermit
crab why was it adapting with our waste
and I wanted to learn as much as I
possibly could about this adaptive
behavior so as soon as I got home I got
on the computer I researched information
concerning this and I couldn&#39;t find
anything out there so I immediately made
contact with a popular publication
agency and I told the story of finding
this hermit crab adapting with our waste
now I think it would make a great topic
for your magazine and I provided the
images as well and kindly respectfully
the editor got back to me and stated
thank you but we do have the
makes a great topic but we do have our
stories already planned out for the year
but please post it on our online
photo-sharing site so sure enough I did
and I didn&#39;t get any feedback from it
and I slightly discouraged because I
knew in my mind that this would make a
powerful topic years went by without
seeing another hermit crab adapting with
our waste and it wasn&#39;t until 2014 when
I started focusing on photographing the
animals on her coastline specifically
during the night that I started finding
more of these hermit crabs adapting with
her waste so at that point I decided to
start my own project called crabs with
Beach trash homes and I was highly
motivated to document as many as I
possibly could and I even had friends
and family assisting with this as well
and with her help we were able to
document over 60 crabs that were found
naturally using our waste now this was a
great opportunity for me to focus on
improving my photography skills as well
as my lighting now I wanted to deliver
documentation photographs but I also
wanted to provide dramatic lighting as
well so all the images did not look the
same so I spent most of my time
photographing these hermit crabs with
high-powered flashlights as well as
flash on camera as well as flash off
camera with different diffusion
materials and different light angles I
spent most of my time photographing
these hermit crabs on beaches with
abundance of trash and it seemed like
the trash here of the beach the more
hermit crabs I seem to find most of
these items that were washed ashore were
single-use items or throwaway items
found lots of medicine prescriptions
styrofoam plastic twist top caps as well
as bottles plastic forks knives spoons
lighters flip-flops shotgun shells ropes
cigarette butts and more I also took a
scientific approach when photographing
these hermit crab
I photographed him for the meteor
neighbor&#39;s project which is dedicated to
connecting people worldwide with the
wildlife in their community and this
method really stood up stood out because
it focused on the beauty in the detail
of the hermit crab as well as what trash
it was using and it eliminated any
distracting elements in the background
but at first this project just didn&#39;t
get the recognition that I expected that
was is because I didn&#39;t have the
powerful content or was it because I
wasn&#39;t reaching the right people or the
right editors or was it because people
don&#39;t enjoy looking at images of trash
on their wall right because
realistically what people prefer to have
on their walls are images of beach
scenes seascapes sunrises and so at this
point I decided to change the
perspective of things and photograph
these hermit crabs in beautiful light
during sunset next to these scenes so
people would start looking at this issue
they would see it in a different light
now the hermit crabs are the caretakers
of the shoreline they mainly feed on
them the marine life that wash ashore as
well as they feed on fruit and help out
with seed dispersal and they even clean
up after our waste after beach barbecues
and parties when people throw the
leftovers on the ground that the
scavengers at the shoreline these hermit
crabs they prefer to have a solid shell
to protect their sensitive body they&#39;re
sensitive abdomen and they will even
adapt but the tree nut if nothing else
is available now some of the most
interesting man-made items that I have
found the hermit crabs adapting with
have been screws from light bulb ends
glass bottles measuring scoops and
laundry detergent caps so why do these
hermit crabs adapt with our waste in the
first place is there a limit
number of shells due to over collecting
on our shorelines that&#39;s definitely
possible but what we do know is these
crabs they grow they get bigger and they
have to currently they have to
constantly upgrade their current mobile
home they fight over this valuable real
estate eventually the strong will push
out the weak the weak will abandon the
shell and eventually it has to find
something to deal with to adapt with and
they don&#39;t prefer to have her waste to
adapt with our trash they&#39;re just
temporarily making do with what is
available at the time now no Kino hermit
crabs have few predators mainly other
hermit crabs ants birds and of course
humans their biggest threat habitat loss
and over collecting to the pet trade
every hermit crab that you see in the
pet shop was taken from the wild now at
first I was absolutely fascinated with
the crabs ability to adapt to a changing
environment that was drastically
affected by humans the more and more
that I photographed these crabs the more
concerned I was with the amount of waste
that was washing up on her beautiful
shorelines now we&#39;re all guilty up
looting our environment in some way or
form so how can we fix this problem what
can we do to make a difference first we
could start off by reducing single-use
items that we use and purchase on a
daily basis and make the switch to
reusable resources now the two items
that pose the biggest threat in our
community in our oceans are plastic bags
and twist stop caps from beverage
bottles we could easily switch to
reusable products on a daily basis we&#39;re
all capable of doing that next we need
to do a better job of preventing the
waste from getting in the ocean in the
first place by ensuring that we&#39;re
disposing of our trash as well as
recycling it better and last we need to
do a better job of collecting the waste
from the ocean as well as the shoreline
and how can all of us make a difference
in this by simply participating in a
beach cleanup this is extremely Bennett
official to the environment as well as
to the community we&#39;re all capable of
doing it all ages and we have the
ability to inspire others through social
media posts to do something great for
the environment because the more we
learn about nature the more we want to
protect it so why is it important to
remove this trash its plastic pollution
on our shorelines now now the longer it
stays on the shore it becomes weathered
it becomes brittle it breaks down into
smaller pieces that photo degrades then
it becomes much more difficult to clean
up to pick up as well as eventually it
washes back out to sea and starts
affecting the wildlife from the bottom
of the food chain and working its way
back up now the hermit crab is one of
the few animals that could successfully
adapt for their waste now we are
destroying our environment with these
single-use items at an unstoppable rate
we&#39;ve seen all the warning signs now
it&#39;s time to act all it takes is making
some small changes in our daily
activities that can make a difference in
our future thank you
