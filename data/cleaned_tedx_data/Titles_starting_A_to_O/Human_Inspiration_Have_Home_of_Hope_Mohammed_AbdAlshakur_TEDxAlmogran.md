well when the rain when the Sun does not
with the sky does not rain water when
the sky does not bring rain definitely
rains one
why just the sky rains warm in a state
of water
why the air is dry at the moment while
we hear this
we better hear another vegan six
when we look at ourselves at this
dynamic world the stuff I stand and
filter us yet the curve has thrown a
little hall gentle wind on a fluffy
water I want you to see your home deep
down the seat
technical the nicest my fellow tennis
speakers ladies and gentlemen this is
Misha for the motivational and
inspirational speaker I&#39;m coming through
from the capital city of Siddhartha
people come to us with an eyeless
cartoon and it is very good moment I
wanted to show you a story of a little
skinny geek who growing up between Fox
forces streets I promise
it is Tara listening and here is very
mixed rolls now hearing and listening to
the sounds of wax the sounds that I hope
at all
Sam&#39;s that does not bring home everybody
but bring fear a song that doesn&#39;t have
anything on that Sunday 20 2003 the sky
has given pawn and people with fragment
I remember that skinny kid Rumble is
head down the path is aching and the
mind start thinking why story&#39;s been
told to so many of us because someone
else go through tough times shopping
areas food and reasonably is the third
big job what I mean there are so many
times to surrender there are so many
times to give up on your things but also
there are some times to go on what I ask
you a question of what would happen if
they ask you not to be who you are what
will happen if they ask you not to be
the one you want to be the only one
thing come back again is surrender while
we surrender when we come to talk about
ourselves when we are around rumbling
our caves
looking at the ground our back is taking
and our hands we are back up we need to
go
our towels when you come to the
situation of self-identification you
feel your end you feel it was nothing
you can use this and nothingness but I
come to tell you not that is not exactly
what you you supposed to be that it&#39;s
another image is that negative image but
let&#39;s come in I cannot see I have had no
opportunity to be honest unlike my peers
the people in the stage but that&#39;s
written the future of mine I said no
that&#39;s not now the entire villages and
speed life turn into ashes but luckily a
horror family in the white night oh that
was the starting point of my new life in
Drabek City in 2005 the first time I
have seen Russia I&#39;ve seen that first
time to see people speak the same thing
in a different manner
I said no Ethan it&#39;s time to start a new
kind of person who will come down over
and talk to you in that
I have not heard of telling stories
because I&#39;m definitely sure your stories
are quite inspiring than mine but that
thing comes to me to tell Who am I and
what am I going to reach there is no I
you must and to wrong spoon to study
asserting that they don&#39;t really want
now being to do that in person history
faculty of engineering electricity was
not my own passion but a little Russian
in me tell that you gotta be a speaker I
was dreaming to be a speaker before I
speak everything I have read to figure
someone talk to the public everywhere I
have become a speaker in East Africa 40
40 countries and yet sending the message
around what I believe that we are all
passion to move on why we have stood the
notification because we believe that we
are not otherwise yes we are now let&#39;s
see another day
what will happen when you lose hot
you&#39;ve been a salad you remain someone
does not move that&#39;s not a girl
that&#39;s not do anything I was salad I
looked hot and I gave up myself but he&#39;s
time to think again in another way I
have been working on those closed doors
for so long that let me lose time age
Resources definitely money as well now
that was another time looking on those
very closed doors but let&#39;s see the
difference in somebody else ends with
the growth of happiness closes another
open but we keep looking at those closed
doors that we do not see the one who&#39;s
been open for us please ask yourself a
dance of which are open
other than those not closed doors
anybody who&#39;s been knocking on the
closed doors with the main knocking on
those doors with never open look at the
other doors open for you in a state of
looking on those closed doors you can&#39;t
be public speaker I have become
and that time moving from graphic to
capital city was very difficult because
my professor said we cannot change your
profession from engineering to bars and
I said okay as I come into the
university without an invitation I gotta
get out without invitations walls I&#39;ve
cut out lately mr. Cheney Street walking
on myself every day at night when I said
living in Cetina Street
don&#39;t find time I got her an apartment
there was a shelter the water shelter
under catalyst then given it to me by a
very fantastic gentleman said you can
live under this building which is
incomplete going to our market every day
on good from city I was pretending sport
man I&#39;m jogging every day
[Music]
then I have determined to write a book
that tell not my story
no the book doesn&#39;t have to tell my
story but the hope that human
inspiration has to tell a story of
people men who got an hour Mike to talk
with people like me who have no
opportunity on Facebook or Wesa people
who have never met people to talk to
them and tell them their story I wanna
tell their story in that human
inspiration and that book was written
through that time those times Bush and
Bush factor that time factor was the
delicious food to be I mean there&#39;s a
very big thing happening in my life but
that will not be different than the
other ones because you and I can make
everything because the somebody said one
man power can do nothing but we have a
whole power can do everything i captain
who can I walk Red Waste
friends the frailing who wakes you to be
successful to say congratulations but
they are a friend the friend movements
sxs to your hand my brother and my
friend
they are who is not here has given me an
opportunity to stay home in Allah said
if sister was mine
his mother was mine it is the place
where I can go to the kitchen I have
never missed my family it is not because
I am NOT emotional but because I got
someone who work and that the true tell
of Sudanese people and that&#39;s the true
tale of who we are
then I a new person on my staff by
bringing a chapter of my book and that
chapter Poland through the finish I want
to ask people watch Triple H anybody
knows what abilities don&#39;t tell me that
one was passing in the valley W even on
[Music]
it is the first chapter of the human
inspiration I started this chapter in
length top in la lluvia
because I was inspired by the confluence
office of denials in the cartoon
we call it movement and the same name
right now clock please
[Applause]
compromise God never given to any city
in the world from where does this
inspiration come it comes from rather
then I said let me see what is the
source of this confluence I&#39;ve traveled
to Ethiopia Lake Tana started writing
the chapter in the tour of next time
bring it back to the tomb then I travel
again to make a Victoria in Uganda
cut the other source of the view knife
because the white knights are coming
from do Canada and the one ha and the
goon are coming from Catalina bringing
only inspiration back to consume then
abstract these triple catch now I will
tell you what does it mean to forget
the Triple H is an acronym says have a
home home don&#39;t build a home o spoon or
brakes or mountains built a home home if
you have a home of hope you can leave if
I ask you to live in this house nobody
could leave this is the house that I
lived in my shield in assist industry
this was the house I was living there
but I have decided to build that home
bringing the truthful heads together
with the first sketch because half is
possessed anybody has something must be
proud of it let me start from the West
damn that lately I come from we have a
very fantastic prepare I hope you know
it it says if I have a little thing
better than somebody else who has a big
thing that&#39;s in half in our local
languages I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to go at
Kinnick Ines I hope you understand this
meaning it means that if I have a small
thing and I own it it&#39;s better than
someone else has a bigger thing and I
can own it I don&#39;t believe in and not
terrible just a voucher I can link it up
[Music]
no don&#39;t don&#39;t just do about that push
it
next edges this is happened at home do
we tell me what the home is black
because that Sunday with the skies rain
poured on us it was midnight midday but
it was midnight people have seen the
stars of the midday but that one one
time people so people have seen me you
understand right so now let&#39;s see the
other it is harmful but now this is the
house I live in but this whole hahahaha
hope is a theory I started to develop
from Uganda Jamaica Yukiya to Khartoum
one of the very inspirational things did
that because this is the true of
inspiration what inspiration there is
something called self-motivated Preston
and Dee Dee self-motivated person the
self-motivated person the person who
always believed to opinion and leave the
power they have and they go further so
what happened healthy after I have in
this then I started to look at my
positive sights the time I travel to
another country of Africa to Kenya I
borrow her name is up from America she
said to me do you know something called
NYC Africa News Commission tell I know
it&#39;s a representation of 55 countries
and then I know they are nominated to
present the country
you dance throughout the 55 African
countries and right now Commissioner for
peace and security for the entire there
is something important here I want to
invite you I want to invite you to be a
person of yourself to be optimistic yet
we have another proverb from them from
the East Sudan text about our visit
that&#39;s what somebody also talk about
tumble that this is the calm horse on
set and not shelling then managed to
film school property
that&#39;s exactly how it works
so he&#39;s been at the family idea rasa
which by the gospel Eva Braga do not
look at that way look at everything from
a different site in the light the last
one is when there was something called
international united nation used
campaign employment my home country was
missed but I plan to travel around the
continent to bring this to our country
our project will start in 2020 2030 and
we will create 40,000 jobs for students
use less give ourself hope Sudanese
