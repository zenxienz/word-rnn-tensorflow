good afternoon everyone
so I was asked to talk about the three
pillars of life and massage evoke and
enlighten
yes I a massage a future filled with all
comforts who wouldn&#39;t want that but all
said and done I am most happy when I&#39;m
surrounded by people who love and care
about me I&#39;m alive and happy to be here
today
I used the word alive because it reminds
me of the dreadful 26/11 attack I was
among the lucky ones to survive the
memory of that horrifying day is still a
fresh in my mind as though it only just
happened yesterday a group of terrorists
entered various locations in Mumbai
killed and destroyed more than 200
people the onslaught known to us is
26/11 the young men who ventured into
the hotel amongst other places with the
intention of gunning down the public
what did they demonstrate the wonderful
and brutal side of the human mind what
did they seek to spread fear through
terrorism I was one of the many to
experience the ordeal that lasted nearly
three days haven&#39;t been stuck for as I
was contemplating what lay ahead never
could I imagine that I would experience
a terror attack it was a typical hectic
day at the Taj November is peak season
time there were wedding receptions
banquets cocktail dinners and a lot of
events happening at the hotel suddenly
we sounded what sounded like fireworks
being wedding season time I assumed the
same suddenly we heard and we started
getting phone calls and text messages
intimating us that there was a gunman on
the loose so the only thing at that
point to do was to shut the doors and to
deny access to anybody who tried to
enter we pushed the hot food trolleys to
The Doors asked her guests to move away
from the doors and windows against the
walls and settle down on the floor at
one point of time people about sixty
five of us locked him emotions and
anxieties raging high no one knew what
was going on outside eventually the new
started pouring in and we were informed
that there wasn&#39;t one but four
terrorists in the hotel how do I relate
what happened that night - the theme of
today&#39;s talk what does it mean to me why
is it important what changes did I
experience during and after the event I
believe that when difficult times
prevail you either play the victim or
you get over it and do something about
it I wasn&#39;t brought up to play the
victim
if you have the ability to rise to the
occasion then you ought to you owe it to
yourself and to others around you I did
what was right for me and the other 65
in the room you also need to understand
that you here for a reason everything
happens for a reason you have something
very profound to accomplish if you
wouldn&#39;t if there is nothing that you
have to accomplish you wouldn&#39;t be here
don&#39;t ignore the clues no matter how
bizarre they may seem now this may sound
a bit conceited but under the
circumstances I felt I could handle the
situation better than anybody else that
day it called for someone to take
control over a situation which otherwise
could have god forbid ended badly I had
faith in myself because I was the only
one I could control if I could keep calm
I could do much more the decision to
stay put and not venture out looking for
a way to get out was entirely
intuitional I&#39;m generally a very
impulsive person but that was not the
right time to make a move or to show
heroics rather to wait for the right
time to make a move as one would expect
there were people who didn&#39;t agree staff
and guests both when you&#39;re in a room
full of CEOs of the largest and most
successful multinationals
people will ask you what you&#39;re up to
and they will expect a plan of action
well I didn&#39;t have a plan back then and
I don&#39;t even have a plan right now all I
knew was that we needed to keep
everybody safe and that under the
circumstances was achieved by bullying
some and by reassuring some on a lighter
note there was plenty of alcohol in the
room and we made sure that was well
circulated I was anxious not only for
myself but for the others who with me
but I did not want to allow myself to
believe that we wouldn&#39;t make it it
didn&#39;t make sense to think the worse of
course it&#39;s absolute louwman nature to
want to you know survive that&#39;s when the
brain starts ticking but if you allow
yourself to calm down and make sense of
the situation you can do much more I did
what I could to the best of my shaky
nerves at that point of time we kept in
touch with security through the night
you know to get quick updates on the
situation we even devise plans to
evacuate if we got a chance
but then that again was risky now

picture this it was around 3:00 a.m. and
the terrorists were gunning and
destroying everything inside they were
just burning everything inside the
chandeliers was shaking and dust falling
on our heads so nobody knew what was
going on outside but eventually the news
started pouring in again and the NSG
were now finally in the hotel around

3:00 a.m. and the operation to fight the
enemy had begun at daybreak the next day
we had a chance to make a move we broke
some windows we saw the fire brigade
outside we waved out to them and they
you know we were finally able to get our
guests to safety looking back I feel
these events portrayed a part of us the
third stuff that we did not know existed
till then the inherent force and
calmness that was exhibited in the face
of a potentially fatal situation the
decision to stay put while some wanted
to run out probably to their deaths and
condemning the rest by giving out their
locations was a logical one I think we
were successful in getting all our
guests
to safety from a very perilous situation
from this viewpoint the touch made a
mark the theme of today&#39;s event is in
visage evoke enlighten implying that
imagination can lead to enlightenment
these three words when put together
represent the journey of your life
imagination see sorry imagination sparks
inspiration as it did for me on that
fateful day it called for an inner
strength that I had never experienced
before coming to evoke the second pillar
of life I think it is very important for
a person to keep oneself constantly
motivated by evoking time and again the
memory of such an unforgettable incident
that almost became a milestone in one&#39;s
life I hope my experience can help you
cope with any situation with courage and
conviction it is through sharing that we
learn from each other
evoking must logically lead to
enlightenment the third pillar of life
enlightenment is the ability to perceive
the truth it is also the ability to
analyze a situation and tread cautiously
towards your action plan I would be
happy if my experience serves as an
instrument towards your enlightenment
nothing is impossible is the inside that
dawned on me that day in closing I would
like to read something I&#39;d like to share
something that I read online I don&#39;t
know the author but I found it quite
interesting an app for me it&#39;s titled
God assigning duties to each zodiac sign
to you Libra I give the mission of
service that humans will be mindful of
their duties to others that they may
learn cooperation as well as the ability
to reflect on the other side of their
actions I will put you everywhere there
is discord and for your efforts I will
give you the gift of love thank you very
much
[Applause]
you
