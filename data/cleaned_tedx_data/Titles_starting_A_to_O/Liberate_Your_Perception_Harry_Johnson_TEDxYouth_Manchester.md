hi everyone I&#39;ve got an idea that I feel
is worth sharing so I hope you can take
something from it him so over the summer
I felt a very profound sense of freedom
and for once I had no real idea on how I
was going to allocate my time and that
strains when you&#39;ve been in a very
systematic set surrounding for so long
like the workplace and education but I
met different people from different UK
backgrounds I conversed with different
Europeans and I genuinely saw life in a
different form I felt liberated from a
lot of the false perceptions that had
harbored about my life you know I think
as a people we do all these false
perceptions we have that tedious
tendency to define ourselves but
everything in front of our eyes and we
always neglect to have marelize behind
them we fail to recognize an infinite
potential that we all possess a
potential that is indiscriminate one
that is boundless present in all people
everywhere and this capacity this
potential
it&#39;s almost manifested in man to form
the world around us today you know to an
extent you woke up in Martin Luther
King&#39;s dream this morning and every time
you use your iPhone beyond the messages
you seen Steve Jobs innovation and his
greatness and that&#39;s incredible but our
system today it doesn&#39;t attempt to draw
out this greatness and people were
taught obedience trained to be practical
manufactured to function as a group and
follow and if you&#39;re anything like me
you&#39;ve felt this your whole life you
study maths but it never really gave you
an answer not one word in English that
was ever expressive and at the end of
all this your value to society was
examined by papers that were working
against you
in a world where everyone wants to
succeed but to me it just seems that any
little difference is wrong their
employees won&#39;t accept it because it&#39;s
just unacceptable that hairstyles
extreme and tattoos are disgusting but
what I came to realize is these ideals
that the employers hold only come from
the same institutions that surround us
today but you know capitalism it
installed you have ideals of material
success you on the best pay job for the
best clothes in the best car and all
this is intended to breed success but
this is a misconception it&#39;s Mis
we&#39;d and Lily Tomlin said that even if
you win the rat race he&#39;s still just a
rat best wrestler not those crews will
never be who you are but we always must
be the best-dressed because as people we
do have it within us to be selfish and
we know this because we see on TV people
pursue murder for profits we raise war
over their ownership of oil but this
selfish capacity its preyed upon
education puts us in competition whilst
we are forced to be greedy to meet the
needs of our surroundings but the irony
that I realize is none of this really
matters just imagine if we stopped
walking to society for me and we could
look within ourselves practically access
our infinite potential and act upon it
we could break the trends our output is
powerful I think we need to be giving
out the positivity that for our savino&#39;s
whilst not allowing the negativity that
Fester&#39;s in us all to be accessed and
exploited by the systems we are
inculcated to participate in today and
so my message redefine how you define
yourself your own potential and shine as
an individual seek self-worth beyond the
system because if you can change your
mind you may just change the world thank
you
you
