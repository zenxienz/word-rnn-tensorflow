I work in a company where our users and
customers are used to not being hurt
they&#39;re used to being looked at as
charity cases as someone who needs help
all the time one of the disastrous
things about finding yourself in a group
like this is that almost no one treats
you like a serious customer and you
might say that that&#39;s a good thing that
we shouldn&#39;t push the weakest among us
to buy things but parts of that attitude
has really deprived these groups of good
solutions and technology that could
really work for them so the reason I&#39;m
here today is my job two years ago I
co-founded a company called no isolation
and as our name quite clearly states we
try to help people out of loneliness and
social isolation and we&#39;re doing that by
building technology products solutions
for those who simply cannot use generic
tools to cover their needs because
loneliness is a huge and diverse problem
really a pandemic that doesn&#39;t
discriminate on age or gender or
nationality
we couldn&#39;t hope to fix all of these
different groups problems at once so we
started where we thought we could have
the biggest impact with the kids and
teenagers suffering from long-term
illness children that literally cannot
leave their bedroom or hospital bed for
months or even years at a time more than
half a million kids are in this group
every year in the EU and being severely
sick does a lot to you but it does not
alter your need for social connection
and friendships and the question that we
ask ourselves in the beginning and that
we get to oft now as why can&#39;t they just
use a tablet well there&#39;s a million
reasons why because having an iPad does
not just let you magically be present in
the classroom there
has to be a parent or a teacher that&#39;s
willing to put in a lot of efforts to
make it happen and that&#39;s just not good
enough so we wanted and needed to find a
simple way to take these kids out of
their bedrooms maybe virtually but still
into the real world
find a way to let them not only observe
their peers in social media really let
them be present when things actually
happen and I&#39;m going to show you a video
it&#39;s of our first product it&#39;s a
telepresence robot that lets children go
wherever they want to go despite of
their physical health and let them see
and even talk to you through the robot
their friends in real time and Eric in
the movie he&#39;s been using one of our
robots for over a year now

I both in science why
thank you building a product like this
the Mansa focused that the tech industry
today is not very good at demands that
you spend time with your users
now you test and test and test again to
understand their limitations and their
motivations and their needs and as
someone from the tech industry myself I
unfortunately have to say we when I talk
about the industry as a whole and I
would claim that we have failed Wells
generic consumer technology has gotten
better and better
making efficient people more effective
than ever
the group that drops out and falls
behind keeps growing so we could say
that previously we failed the kids with
long term illness but the biggest
wrongdoing has been done to the seniors
the ones that should be able to
contribute to society with their
experience and skills and I do not know
if you have heard of this but there&#39;s a
concept called leathery fingers it only
means that your fingertips are dry it&#39;s
very common amongst those over 80 and
dry fingertips would not have been a
problem at all
if it wasn&#39;t for a genius invention is
called touchscreens touchscreens do not
respond well to very dry fingertips and
if you&#39;ve ever sat next to a senior
trying to operate a touch surface you&#39;ve
probably noticed how most of them find
it hard you&#39;ve probably also rolled your
eyes a little and asked them to try
again but that simply mean because
touchscreens are not built for old hands
and to figure out things like this you
have to invest a lot in your users but
if we keep looking at the 92 year old as
a charity case we&#39;ll continue giving him
whatever we have left over from when we
made something for ourselves like the
tablet by not looking at the 92 year
olds as a potential core customer we&#39;re
not only ignoring a huge potential
market were robbing him of services and
choices
so two years ago no isolation started
working with the kids and you saw a bit
of the results in the video now I&#39;m
going to try to explain what happened
when we almost a year ago started
working with the oldest parts of the
population so we started in January by
recognizing that none of us are over 80
and even if we were we wouldn&#39;t
represent the entire group so we needed
input and we spent two months on only
reading up and interviewing seniors and
their caretakers and we tried really to
identify the isolating factors in their
lives we also tried to explore the
technology available to them and you
have no idea how disturbing pop-up
windows on computers are until you sat
next to an 87 year old who insists on
reading the content of every single one
and then there&#39;s a lot of pop-up windows
so one quarter of our senior population
goes days without opening their mouths
to talk and as much as a third of
everyone over 80 and EU it&#39;s a lot of
people tell us or says that they&#39;re
haunted by loneliness and technology is
doing next to nothing for them and we
are starting to figure out why no one
has really solved this before us because
it&#39;s hard and because everything that we
as engineers wanted to do ended up
slightly resembling magic like voice
control and eye tracking it was rejected
by our user group and touch screens was
useless for more than half of them but
the most daunting experience we had was
that the seniors had completely given up
on technology they had no confidence
that technology could even be something
for them but we are talking about the
people who were around when the
television was introduced the same
people who saw the washing machine come
to life and you actually watched as the
first man walked on the moon how can
they say that technology is not
something for
them or more precisely what did we do to
traumatize them my generation and the
one above me must have completely missed
the point technology is here to help and
assist us and certainly not here to make
people feel stupid or to make some of us
work faster but how could we as a small
start-up introduce valuable tech in a
completely non intrusive way well we
tried a lot of ideas but in May this
year we were closing in on this might be
a solution we were still still very
scared we might have missed but we
hacked together
homemade computers and we recruited five
families to do a serious test the
seniors all of them above 80 had very
varying handicaps like vision and
mobility and sight impairments and they
they only really had two things in
common the first one was that none of
them wanted to be a part of the test and
the second one was that their families
really did so the seniors betrayed by
their own got prototypes installed in
their homes and we tried to assure them
that they did not have to do anything
their families would take care of do all
the work but we were fighting against
the tide we&#39;re trying to force 80 and 90
year olds to test the latest tech and
the most tech averse guy in the group is
84 year old farmer he insisted that we
placed his device in the far corner of
his living room almost behind the
curtain because he did not want this but
only two days after we&#39;d been there and
installed and yet he had asked his
grandson to move this screen close to
his chair so that he could keep track of
the pictures that his family kept
sending him so he was using it and when
we tried ending the test two months
later
none of them wanted to give us our ugly
prototypes back
and today a little over four months
after we gave out some very much
homemade computers these five people
have received over 1500 pictures and
texts from their loved ones on top of
the video calls that goes through
automatically and in the next 30 seconds
I&#39;m gonna try to give you a glimpse of
what we&#39;re making we&#39;re relaunching it
and a month from now it&#39;s very exciting
and yeah let&#39;s see
[Music]
[Music]
we&#39;re calling it Kampf
I&#39;m really not here to promote us
honestly I&#39;m here to hopefully restore
some hope to tell you that the tech
industry is not only here to serve
themselves and to try to convince you
that technology is more than social
media to say that technology can in fact
enable those long and boring face to
face conversations where we get to know
each other and technology can be warm I
also here to say that I think you&#39;ve
been fooled because understanding
technology is really not a measurement
of intelligence if it was so then
plumbing and architecture should be - it
is without a question the tech industry
that needs to build solutions that
everyone can use so my hope is that you
leave here today knowing that is never
your tech skills that should be measured
there&#39;s always the design of the
products offered you and I think it&#39;s
really about time the tech industry
stepped up and started listening to its
users
