since the day I was born
I&#39;ve been going blind I&#39;m 1 in 4,000 and
the first woman in 3 generations of my
family to be born with a rare genetic
divides known as retinitis pigmentosa RP
for short
basically deteriorates the cells of the
retina and while it affects each person
differently most experience tunnel
vision night blindness and a complete
loss of sight these changes occur over
time and in my case I have 10% of my
vision remaining with distinct blind
spots and constant flashing lights you
know those little red lights that you
get sometimes when you shut your eyes
and you&#39;re you&#39;re about to fall asleep I
see those every minute of every day and
you probably can&#39;t tell because I&#39;ve
done everything in my power to make sure
that you don&#39;t know that I&#39;m legally
blind now you&#39;re wondering what 10
percent kind of feels like do me a favor
put your hands and little small circles
like that hold them up to your eyes kind
of like binoculars try to look around
it&#39;s kind of what it feels like and as a
bonus y&#39;all look pretty silly so when I
run into you later I won&#39;t be quite as
embarrassed so thank you for that now
this isn&#39;t a story about blindness and
it&#39;s not a story about overcoming a
disability this is my story the story
about how I deal with the reality of
going blind it&#39;s about my belief system
of accepting inevitable change preparing
for that change and coping with the fear
of change accept prepare cope
now I was diagnosed at 16 but if I&#39;m
honest I&#39;ve always known I grew up
watching the men of my family become
more and more reliant on the people
around them I watched my father have to
completely reinvent himself after he
lost his job about the same age I am now
and while it&#39;s really difficult to see
them struggle it&#39;s even more challenging
when you realize that their presence is
my future and as an independent woman a
mom a wife and a corporate event planner
that prospect is pretty terrifying
incredibly terrifying so except prepare
cope it isn&#39;t a life mantra it&#39;s more
like an ongoing daily activity that can
go from except a coat back to accept
without even a moment of preparation
some days all I do is cope but let me
first tackle acceptance loss of sight is
inevitable
I could slow the progression of the
disease down by taking high doses of
vitamin A but I&#39;ve made a conscious
choice to lose my eyesight rather than
my liver I kind of need the ladder to
survive and so in that Quay ssin
eyesight really just becomes a luxury RP
cannot be cured it can only be managed
now I see some sad faces no no sad this
is not sad because there are actually
some really positive things about going
blind too
right so for example I have great
memorization and listening skills my
trainer only makes me do one set of
stairs instead of two and I always have
a designated driver
there&#39;s also another dynamic here it&#39;s
it&#39;s being a woman being the only woman
in my family see I&#39;ve grown up watching
the men of my family become more and
more reliant on their wives and their
wives being more than happy to be relied
on in my case my husband tries so hard
to remember to take my hand if it&#39;s dark
to wait for me as I maneuver around a
new environment if somebody needs my
attention he makes sure they have my
attention and I love him so much for so
many reasons but one of them is because
he actually chose to marry me
knowing that this was going to be our
future but then sometimes he forgets and
I trip over a curb or I kick one of
those damn wet floor signs across a
restaurant or my face violently collides
with a light pole and I don&#39;t blame him
he knows that I want to do as much as
possible on my own but I can&#39;t help
getting a little bit of satisfaction
when I have to go to the hospital forget
another black eye and he has to answer
those are you abusing your wife
questions
because when you tell them that you ran
face-first into a parking meter somehow
that&#39;s just not credible so I learned to
accept more help from him and more help
from my friends I also had to learn how
to accept more help from my co-workers
which was without a doubt the hardest
ask I&#39;ve ever had to make
you see work is where you&#39;re supposed to
be the most independent and I take that
so seriously so seriously in fact that
most of my co-workers probably have no
idea until they see this about it at all
I learned how to delegate so that I
didn&#39;t end up in swarms of people or a
room under construction I learned to not
scream x-rated expletives when I ran
into a desk or a door or most memorably
an unmovable cement bench
no matter the bruises that I earned I
learned that the people I could rely on
who just take my hand and say now let&#39;s
go so that I could achieve more do more
and be more so except prepare cope
it&#39;s a little easier to wrap my head
around acceptance when I&#39;m focusing on
the preparation part of the equation so
most days I spend a lot of time
preparing in some way usually it&#39;s a
short-term prep such as figuring out the
layout of the building or trying to get
from point A to point B on city streets
I find that it makes me habitual lead
late sometimes I&#39;m just roaming around
the first floor trying to find the
stairs to a second floor meeting room
I&#39;ve also learned that I had to prepare
for the future
see I&#39;m not so naive to think that I can
be an event planner for forever as my
eyesight continues to deteriorate I know
that it will be time to move on so I
went back to school I got my MBA I got
my coaching certification also that I
had another opportunity at a second
career and and you know depending on
whatever that wanted to be I&#39;m starting
to learn Braille so that I can continue
to read I work on my husband about
living somewhere walkable he works on me
about getting a guide dog for him or me
I&#39;m not sure but all of those things
have helped me to prepare for the future
except prepare cope when you can&#39;t see
there are plenty of things to be afraid
of both big and small I am afraid to
walk it in large crowds because I am
slow I am trying not to trip over you
and I&#39;m trying not to trip over my feet
and fall on the floor most people
unfortunately don&#39;t have patience for
that and I have been called every name
in the book and I can tell you after
years of exhaustive research bitch is
definitely the most favorite it&#39;s okay
because I tell myself that I&#39;m a
trendsetter and I&#39;m just changing the
definition of that word
I&#39;m also afraid to do new things on my
own by myself this summer I had an
opportunity to work in New York a short
three blocks away from the 9/11 memorial
I hadn&#39;t been back since 2002 and I
desperately wanted to go it took me two
hours of internal debate checking with
the concierge checking GPS all to gain
the courage to walk out the front door
and what I want you to understand is I
had nothing to do with finding the
memorial even I can see that from three
blocks away it had to do with the fear
of physically injuring myself by not
being able to see around construction or
falling off a curb into traffic or worse
yet a bike messenger I&#39;m pretty sure
that they have a no mercy rule in the
end I believed I could do it I did it
and I loved every minute of that
experience anxiety would be everywhere
if I allowed it to be find myself in a
dark room I wasn&#39;t expecting terrifying
having my wedding ring fall off my
finger and not be able to find it silly
but terrifying having to have one of my
teenage driver daughters drive me
somewhere after dark not silly
terrifying for you and for me
and lastly coping with fear is me
standing on this stage telling the world
my biggest secret when all my life I&#39;ve
been told not to for the fear of losing
my job my insurance my choices and my
independence we all have something I&#39;m
certainly not special maybe yours is in
physical maybe it&#39;s emotional or
psychological maybe you&#39;re dealing with
moving to a new country or you&#39;re
dealing with the loss of a spouse or a
sick child I think that we can all fry
with just a little belief see I believe
that acceptance of my limitations is not
the same as resigning to them I believe
that preparation helps to eliminate
unnecessary risks and I believe that
coping with fear is more than just
recognizing the fear but continuing on
despite it I believe that I&#39;ve done what
I can to prepare for the future I
believe that I&#39;ve surrounded myself with
people who love me no matter what comes
next and I believe that I&#39;m up to any
challenge with a little accept prepare
and cope I refuse to just exist in life
I will continue to take the risk because
I know I believe that I can I will
experience everything that life has to
give me whether it takes me massive
amount of preparation or it takes me
hours to build the courage just to walk
out the door and I will experience it
not by how you see it but by how I see
it accept
prepare cope and believe
to more than just exist when everything
changes but do me a favor and watch out
for bike messengers thank you
