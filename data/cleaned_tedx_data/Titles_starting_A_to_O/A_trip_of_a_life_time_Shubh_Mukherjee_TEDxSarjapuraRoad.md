good afternoon guys so when I got to
know that I&#39;m supposed to be speaking
you had this amazingly overconfident
which kind of an introduction so most of
you who don&#39;t know me what if I told you
that I has something in common with
Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates
Michael Jackson such and then the Shah
Rukh Khan just name anyone mark bill
Cady anyone and I have something in
common with each one of them now
unfortunately it&#39;s not the money they
have but it&#39;s the fact that we&#39;ve all
been out on this trip which is one of
the most amazing trips that we&#39;ve ever
taken it&#39;s an incredible journey
although absolutely unique but it&#39;s a
journey which actually makes you feel
like you&#39;re on a trip of life that and
right now I&#39;m here to take you guys on a
trip of a lifetime so I&#39;ll be like your
tour guide travel operator kind of a
person and I will take you on a trip of
a lifetime so let us all assume that we
all have a journey right each one of you
are in some kind of a journey you are
going somewhere in life
or what the fact is that most of us are
going in a trip or in a direction which
has been imposed by a lot of external
factors so a lot of people tell us where
to go what to do what not to do this
Reyes looks fine I think you should go
there so a lot of factors actually
define where you&#39;re actually going so
our journey is not entirely defined by
us for instance if I have to say that
one of you had to go to Barcelona nine
and a half out of ten people would tell
you so you need to obviously fly down to
the el prat airport from any
International Airport in India obviously
you need to have a passport or visa and
they&#39;ll check your immigration nine and
a half out of ten people no one&#39;s going
to possibly tell you that you can also
drive one so the idea is while choosing
a destination we always have retraced a
journey and retrace the path which most
of us end up following
and we miss on the road which we would
have possibly taken if we did not have a
guideline if you did not have a
destination that we knew how to get
there and that is the road less traveled
and a road trip on that road is where
the most epic and legendary story the
world so let us all assume that we&#39;ve
come from somewhere right and we&#39;re
going to go back to the same place I
mean birth and death are natural facts I
have not really been there yet so I
don&#39;t really know what belongs there so
let us just talk about everything in
between
actually my mom is for the longest of
time telling me that I&#39;ve been picked up
from a park because they heard me crying
next to a swing until obviously I had
biology as a subject in my class and had
understood where I actually came from
but honestly between where we come and
very cool we have a four letter word
called life which is equal to a fool and
a word called trip
and which one of you out here wants to
go on a batch or looks over to a battery
with it&#39;s a business trip or a vacation
or a holiday or romantic trip any one of
you look forward to a battery or you
look for you don&#39;t look for it so none
of us look forward to a bad trip
so why not make life the best trip ever
why not make it the trip of a lifetime
and my convincing enough all right I&#39;m
just trying to be the TripAdvisor here
so let&#39;s just take this trigger for
lifetime
and I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about my
trip and mince you why we should do this
so my trip began in 1985 and one thing
that I know of trips is that it&#39;s about
constantly encountering changes you
would possibly experience change once in
a year or maybe you&#39;ll be surprised with
changes once in a month you&#39;ll probably
be shocked with changes once every are
and what you eventually need to do is be
prepared for change every more but can
you really prepare for change can&#39;t
really prepare for change so what you
need to do is accept this this
preparation is actually acceptance and
adapting to it
now I come from a family like most of
you and mine was a very cosmic one in
nature my father&#39;s from the IIT my
mother&#39;s been pursuing a PhD at the age
of 52 and she&#39;s been a teacher since
birth my birth and a brother who&#39;s a
financial analyst and a risk manager and
his special skills are to be managing
all the risks that I was going to be
I&#39;ll quickly show you what my family
kind of looks like when we go out on a
slight picnic kind of a game it looks
like this so there&#39;s a cliff and we&#39;ve
all gone out to see this view and this
perfect sunset and we have this one
person in every family who&#39;s staying
away from the edge of the cliff because
he does not want to take any risks which
is great which is absolutely fine
they&#39;re the new practical ones the most
sorted out ones and they know what they
want in life
which in my case was my father
then we have a lady standing a little
ahead of that you know these are the
ones who tend to get a little emotional
or carried away sometimes but they have
this immense capacity of bouncing back
to hard core practicality obviously
because they&#39;ve been living with the
person standing behind them for so many
years that in my case is my mother
the third one is not me he&#39;s a sibling
in my case is the one who&#39;s actually
experiencing a little transition between
the generation prior to him or and the
generation coming next so he has the
guts to stand on the edge like I am
standing on the edge of the circle right
now
I better be back
that&#39;s me jumping off the cliff
just like a monkey does right it just
jumped from one place to the other so
just like a monkey I have taken the leap
and I have jumped off but as it if I did
not do that if I did not take that leap
my life would possibly not look like
this
I will now be able to go to the
boundaries of Somalia to shoot the
terrorists killing somebody I will not
be able to learn how to drive
[Music]
and see the world from a bird&#39;s eye yes
I would not be able to do all this if I
did not jump off that day from that
cliff I did that because I wanted to go
to all extremes to cover stories and
that&#39;s exactly what I do for a life and
at least for now for a living and I look
quite happy doing that so now let me at
least be believing the fact that you
guys have been convinced of my travel
making or tripping skills I can at least
sell you a travel package by the end of
this conversation so let me just quickly
tell you the first point in your
checklist when you go or head out on any
trip the first point is go where you
want now most of us end up going where
we don&#39;t want to and that is quite
evident with all the facts and all the
studies that have been done over the
years what you need to do is really go
where you want to and not somewhere
you&#39;ve been told to go to now all of a
sudden if you pick up the phone and call
up a travel agent and say listen I want
to go to Calcutta and he says don&#39;t go
to calculus L go to Tamil Nadu
you obviously not believe in right
you&#39;ll obviously want to continue
planning your trip to Calcutta now the
thing with life is that we live in a
society full of standards expectations
systems formats rules guidelines
previous success stories so we tend to
believe that is absolutely the only way
to go about things
so we end up choosing parts of going in
only that direction
Society and all these systems
I like those bad travel agents who are
gonna put you into a bad trip not give
you all that they&#39;ve promised to give
you and eventually you realize that shit
I&#39;ve made a mistake I&#39;ve come all this
way just to realize what a mess I&#39;ve
made of myself now what is its ultimate
goal that we&#39;re all chasing we are
chasing the goal of being happy the fact
is the 99% actually 99.99% of the people
in this world want to be happy and
because of that goal that we have we set
subsequent goals so some set the fact
that listen I want to do very well in
life I want to have a great wife I want
to be marrying someone I want to be
falling in love I want to be doing
something I wanna have a great job I
want to be this I want to be that we all
said these subsequent goals based on the
fact that we want to be happy although
there are a zillion other ways of being
happy but unfortunately only when you&#39;re
between the ages 0 to 5 you possibly you
know pull someone&#39;s hair and be happy
you just go and sleep on the floor and
you&#39;ll be happy you will create Mama&#39;s
milk and you&#39;ll be happy
I knew Aikido issues fall down and stand
up and go her used to be happy but we do
it right we start growing up and we
start building this framework in between
us so the next time we fall when we have
grown up we are embarrassed we want to
run away we&#39;re even shy of our own
parents the same mother whose milk you
had when you were growing up and you
were one or less we have built an
expectation that has been built by
society for us so we end up taking a
route a path a journey which has
actually been inculcated or pulled or
structured for us and that is the first
mistake we make now for instance most of
the people obviously between the age of
17 to 50 most of them not all want to do
a job because they want to do something
good in life and they do it
and they end up in a job and they have
all the frameworks ready because someone
stole them you need a job you need a
good CV to get a good CV you need to
have the grades you have the good grades
you need to go to a good school or a
good school study hard so we tend to
believe that it&#39;s absolutely right and
we do that and then we realize that
almost 48 percent people are not happy
in their jobs a higher number believe
that they are in wrong jobs so it&#39;s kind
of the fact that they believe that
they&#39;ve probably taken the wrong route
or the wrong journey some of them end up
in depression some of them go to a
shrink and guess what the shrink says
I think you should do what you like I
think you should go you wanted so why
take this whole route of spending 15 20
25 years in some cases to figure this
out
so go where you want to go
the second most important thing is my
favorite enjoy the roadblocks when you
enjoy the roadblocks which in life means
failures you begin to adapt to change
now I love failures I&#39;ve seen them so
many times it almost felt like I&#39;m
having a relationship with failures we
see each other quite often you know we
meet each other we go out and coffee
dates and we come back I&#39;ve seen
failures so many times but that doesn&#39;t
stop anything
failures are just an under weak side of
success
I did not succeed
failure if you make it a good friend of
yours and you&#39;re loyal to feel and you
open up to failure failure possibly you
could tell you back we just scrape off
the knot and it will become I will
succeed or I did succeed I did not win
together failure in you can just drag
off the knot and say I did win
now with my real-life experience I had
so many failures that each and every
failure of my life potentially just
taught me where I&#39;m supposed to be and
where I&#39;m supposed to go when an alpha
doesn&#39;t look good on you you change it
that doesn&#39;t mean you take it off and
walk naked on the streets you don&#39;t do
that you change it wear something that
looks good on you wear something that
you&#39;re comfortable in
so failure is just a weak sign of
success it&#39;s like the road drop in this
ship no travel agent is going to tell
you so when you go there the hotel is
going to have the AC leaking in over on
you
so the second one in your checklist be
prepared for roadblocks and the third
and the last thing is if I would tell
you that you can earn out of your trips
you definitely can if Steve Jobs had to
make his CV unfortunately there will not
be too much in the educational section
because he dropped out but there would
be an immense amount of experience
section because he had a bunch of them
he travelled to India for a recreational
trip on LSD which he thought was very
important for him and nobody told him
that you can only be the founder of
Apple if you do these things so he
followed his road I followed his route
and he did what he wanted to do he he
exactly went on the direction where he
wanted to go
one fine day after doing all the films
around 65 around 11 country 65 cities
that travel all around the world
I was capturing so many things in
between I was documenting very
interesting weddings in a lot of
interesting stories and I had made up
decent amount of money but all the money
went over with the first three checks of
my new checkbook that I had got I had
paid up for new machines that made up
for the new software and had paid up for
a new team and I really wanted to buy a
drone for myself and I went back to my
studio and ironically the same very day
I had this hard drive lying on my desk
which said my bank
now not always will you end up making a
lot of money
but if you live a good life and you take
this trip of a lifetime in a direction
where you want to go facing all the
roadblocks taking up all the challenges
meeting them enjoying them learning from
them communicating with them opening up
to them you&#39;d be making a lot of
memories so the bank that I had at that
one in time was based out of over a
thousand stories of a thousand people
some of which are being aired in
multiple television and I know will be
ad for generations to come so the idea
is not just to make money or chase goals
or chase objectives but also to live an
amazing trip an amazing journey in an
amazing way collecting a lot of memories
because they are timeless
so what you need to do is constantly
adapt to change because the universe is
going to be changing every single moment
and when you let go of your inhibitions
and your fears and while the universe is
also constantly changing both of you
meet at an equilibrium you meet at an
equilibrium and that is where a good
story begins that is where the trip of a
lifetime begins the formula
my idea also tells you not just chase
destinations or spend all your life
chasing goals instead live the journey
every single day chasing happiness
chasing somewhere you really want to go
it&#39;s okay if you make a mistake you lose
a turn on this journey it&#39;s fine now the
thing with other trips that you take is
you can possibly have a bad trip and
make another trip just go online and
book another trip but with this trip you
can just take wrong turns but can&#39;t make
a wrong trip of a lifetime because it&#39;s
happening only once
so the idea is to keep carrying on in a
direction that you want to go face the
roadblocks face the failures adapt to
change
you can have an affair with failures
like I did
and eventually collect all your
experiences all the good things you&#39;ve
done
if you&#39;ve mentored somebody that needs
to be on your CV if you&#39;ve done
something good that needs to be on your
CV have another CV which if no one else
wants to read you can or your best
friend can or your family can or your
children can so my idea is that I don&#39;t
know where I&#39;m going but I&#39;m happy in
wherever I&#39;m going
I am facing failures and I&#39;m expecting
failures every single day and I&#39;m ok
with it and I&#39;ll be really happy if I
meet you where we are going where we
came from and sit over a cup of tea or
whatever they serve there and discuss
each other&#39;s trips our trips of our
lifetimes thank you
[Applause]
