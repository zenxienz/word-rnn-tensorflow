approximately 70 million children don&#39;t
have the opportunity to go to school
every day this is the same number as the
amount of people that live in Thailand
imagine an entire country missing out on
their education out of the 70 million
children that can&#39;t go to school every
day 25 million of them will never go to
school either because of money or there
isn&#39;t a school in the area most of the
kids that aren&#39;t able to go to school
are girls one of the worst places for
school is Africa because 33 million kids
can&#39;t go to school there and 18 million
of these are girls only two-thirds of
these kids will ever graduate high
school this is an amazing story about a
girl named Jacinta at the age of 13 she
lived in Tanzania a country in Africa
when her family could no longer afford
for her to go to school so she had to
drop out she then had to work as a
servant 18 hours a day and only made $13
a month then a cherry called Camfed
raised money free Ascenta and her family
so that she would not have to work
anymore and could go back to school
later she was sent home and had the
opportunity to start school once again
so she headed back to school after she
went to school she got a great job and
was able to send her brothers and
sisters to school but it&#39;s not just the
kids and families that don&#39;t have enough
money it&#39;s there&#39;s not enough teachers
for example in India they need about
350,000 more teachers and in West Africa
they needed about 380,000 more teachers
but for every K in the world to be
educated we would need approximately
five million more teachers when adults
don&#39;t get proper education
his kids it needs two bad things for
example if you aren&#39;t literate you can&#39;t
get a job and you can&#39;t get a job you
can&#39;t make any money
there&#39;s about seven hundred and ninety
eight million adults who still lacked
basic literacy skills and also if you
don&#39;t know what literacy means reading
or writing so ways that you can help is
by donating to a charity as an UNICEF or
campaign camp that is a charity that
helps girls in Africa go to school while
UNICEF is a charity that helps kids all
over the world but what would really
help is spread the word tell your
friends and families about these
charities and to donate the last thing
you can do is just be grateful for your
own education and take school seriously
but this can&#39;t just happen on its own we
need to do it
education is something that not
everybody has so you should value your
education because when we don&#39;t learn
the world never changes
