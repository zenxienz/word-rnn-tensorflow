so enhance Andersen&#39;s fairy tale The
Snow Queen the story starts with a
mirror that&#39;s magic and when you look
into it you can only see the ugly boring
and cruel things in the world it was
made by the evilest demon in the whole
of history and he thought it was
hilarious when you looked into it if you
had a little pimple on your chin
you&#39;d see reflected a horrible
disfiguring posture if you looked into
it at reflection of children playing
you&#39;d see only how cruel they were being
to each other
and the demon showed this mirror to
people but it wasn&#39;t enough for him he
decided to take it up to heaven to show
God and his angels and so he started to
fly upwards and as he did he noticed the
mirror began to tremble and then it
exploded into a hundred thousand tiny
pieces and this was the worst thing that
could have possibly happened because the
pieces rained down on the earth and
sometimes someone would get a piece of
that mirror in their eye and then they
could only see the ugly boring and cruel
things in the world and sometimes
someone would get a piece of that mirror
in their hearts and then their heart
would freeze into a block of ice so I
love that story it might be my favorite
because I feel that all of us have at
some time felt like we&#39;ve got a bit of
that horrible
mirror in our eye so I&#39;m a professional
storyteller and I draw my repertoire
from folktales myths and legends from
all around the world all different
cultures and traditions and I thought
when I was getting ready for this talk
if I looked at all the different stories
from all the different traditions for
popular ones the ones have been told and
retold and see what they have in common
I might find out something about what we
as human beings have in common and so
had a look and I found that from Jack
and the Beanstalk to the aboriginal
Dreamtime stories from the Greek gods to
Harry Potter stories that we tell and
love are underpinned with magic and so
this talk is about magic so I don&#39;t mean
I&#39;m going to show you how to make a love
potion or cut a woman in half or pick a
card that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about
I&#39;m talking about that indefinable
intangible sense of wonder and
expectation which makes you feel as if
you&#39;re living in an enchanted world I
think everybody has felt it at some time
or another in their lives but for a lot
of people it&#39;s something that&#39;s
associated with childhood but stories
aren&#39;t just for children and nor is
magic magic can be powerful and
transformative and it can build bridges
let me give you an example so back in
the 1990&#39;s
I used to share a flat in the West End
of London with a club promoter and at
night he was always out clubbing so
anyway it was August and it was really
hot and I was trying to sleep and he was
out I had all the windows open couldn&#39;t
sleep and I could hear someone outside
on the street shouting up to him because
our doorbell didn&#39;t work and she&#39;s
making a really loud noise and I
couldn&#39;t sleep
and I stuck my head out and I called
down he&#39;s gone out and she went oh thank
God thank God songs here please please
can I come up and just just wait for him
I won&#39;t be any trouble and I thought she
seems alright so you can just come up
and wait in his room he wouldn&#39;t mind I
know I know he wouldn&#39;t mind so um I
went down let her in she followed me up
the stairs but instead of going into his
room I&#39;m waiting for him to came into my
room and she threw herself down on my
bed and by the lights of our room I
could see that like a lot of his friends
she was quite glamorous to look dyed
hair false eyelashes heavy makeup and
she looked funny as well and kind of
strong she was wearing an Elvis Presley
1970s style jumpsuits with flares and
flames at the side and I said I liked
your jumpsuit and she said oh this yeah
it&#39;s a vintage and then she said thank
you so much for letting me come in and
wait I just needed to be with somebody
so bad I&#39;ve had the worst day of my life
and I don&#39;t even know why nothing&#39;s even
happened and I just liked her straight
away and I said oh well what was it she
said well normally she say
I&#39;m in a band but to make money I dance
in the nightclub so it&#39;s 12 hours a day
you know it&#39;s okay I don&#39;t mind it
normally but today she said it was so
hot in there I couldn&#39;t breathe and I
started to think and my mind started
going round and round and suddenly I
started to feel like I&#39;ve died and gone
to hell
and all the men were like demons and I
kept telling myself when I go out it
would be all right and I&#39;d feel better
but I&#39;m out and I don&#39;t feel any better
and I thought I felt sorry for her and I
so hot if I&#39;m so hot and uncomfortable
and I wanted to help her and then just
suddenly it&#39;s completely surreal public
as I&#39;ve sleep-deprived
this totally surreal idea came into my
head and I said do you like swimming
uh-huh
he said I said do you want to come
swimming with me right now
sure she said Oh
middle of the night we went down never
met her before got in my car and drove
to Hampstead Heath which is if you don&#39;t
know it amazingly a beautiful forest
with a lake and everything in the middle
of London
so anyway we got there pitch dark of
course forest no lights or anything and
we got out of car leaving her through
cobwebs breaking over our face sound of
the animals birds
she was giggling and then we came out to
this hillside and the sky was black and
the moon was white and the hill was
totally white with long dry August grass
it was like being in sight and negative
and we came to all the trees where this
this lake was and the lake had such
presence it was like a living thing
shiny and black and I said look it&#39;s
really cold I said and it can be deep so
but she had just pulled off her clothes
and dived in headfirst and then didn&#39;t
come up and I&#39;ll start to get really
worried before she suddenly stuck her
head up in the middle and she shook her
head and all the droplets fell off and
she looks like a mermaid and I got in
the pond as well way spinning around and
she was telling me about her childhood
in Canada riding horses bareback and
swimming in the rivers she was so
different and after that I was different
I didn&#39;t stay in touch with her I hear
she remembered it obviously I remembered
it telling you about it it was like
having a piece of that awful mirror
washed out of my eye and it changed the
way forever
that I relate to the city and I relate
to strangers and so I thought I&#39;d end
this little talk with some ideas about
how you can bring magic into your own
life if you feel inspired to so I do
storytelling events for adults and I was
trying making a magical and these are
things that work for me but you&#39;ll have
to find things that work for you really
the thing the first thing is place so
like a magical forest in the middle of
London&#39;s really good but anyway that&#39;s
beautiful and got lot of history and is
deserted so if there&#39;s snow whenever a
few came here really late at night
and then there&#39;s time of day so middle
of the night which we did with brilliant
or dawn when the day&#39;s just been born
even if it&#39;s gray or when the Sun has
gone down but the sky is still light
cinematographers call that Magic Hour
great time and then the other one is who
you&#39;re with
so don&#39;t want to be too prescriptive but
if there&#39;s a person who you know who
keeps following you around talking about
house prices and school places maybe not
bring them maybe go by yourself and see
who you believe meeting people is all
part of it so that&#39;s just some tips for
you anyway but you&#39;ll find your own way
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s only one thing that I
think is really important
please believe because it is real we do
live in an utterly boring and cruel
world but it&#39;s bursting with Wonder and
beauty and as roald dahl wrote those who
do not believe in magic will never find
it thank you very much
[Applause]
