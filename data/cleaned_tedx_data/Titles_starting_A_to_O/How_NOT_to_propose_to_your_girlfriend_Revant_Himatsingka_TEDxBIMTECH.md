so two years ago I did something really
crazy I spent six months studying day
and night for the I am entrance exams I
did pretty well and I somehow got into I
am Bangalore and then out of nowhere I
decided not to go why because I wanted
to write a self-help comedy book
inspired by AIB and tvf with hashtags
and memes in spite of having no writing
background so just imagine how
ridiculous my ideas seemed that I wanted
to quit my job in New York I wanted to
leave I am to write a book with having
no writing background and my friends and
family could never understand how anyone
could be smart enough to get into I am
Bangalore but stupid enough not to go
and I tried to convince them that you
know all the big successful people that
we heard of Mark Zuckerberg Steve Jobs
they all dropouts and I&#39;m going one step
further not even dropping out I&#39;m not
even going in the first place and my mom
was the only person who was supportive
in the entire journey and she told me
beta if you go too I am will become like
the other I am authors and we all know
the kind of books the other I am authors
right
so so don&#39;t go do I am and this made me
really think and really question did I
make the right decision by not going to
I am
and after some introspection and
research I realized I made the right
decision
I am the great of course but a large
part of the reason why we consider them
to be so prestigious is because of how
difficult it is to receive an admission
offer rather than the quality of
education they provide I don&#39;t remember
the last time I heard someone saying man
I really wanted to study at I am because
I will learn a lot it&#39;s always because
of either a job or because of the brand
associated with I am which is entirely
because of how difficult it is to
receive an admission offer and this sort
of mentality is prevalent amongst
Indians and V Indians we like to equate
hard with useful and the more difficult
something is the more people run behind
it and this is also why all our courses
in our schools I usually tend to be
difficult rather than useful in school I
extensively learned about integration
and differentiation it was like torture
for me but still I somehow survived and
I have had multiple job since college
but I&#39;m still waiting for the day when I
had to apply integration in real life
thousands of years of Indian history
have been reduced to memorizing facts
about three to four individuals like
Mahatma Gandhi Shah Jahan upper like
fifty percent of my history syllabus was
about the Mughal period I can probably
tell you the name of the nightclub Akbar
was partying at on his 21st birthday but
I have no clue about what happened in
the 1950s and 1960s if we can learn
about the Mughal period differentiation
integration in so much detail why can&#39;t
we learn more life relevant skills like
how to make a resume what is the science
behind happiness how to create a great
first impression what happened in India
and the first 10 years after
independence that would be very more
useful relevant and even easier and this
sort of mentality of valuing hard rather
than useful is prevalent according or in
all spheres of our lives and
not just education what would you do if
you want to ask the girl out for
marriage
you would probably go down on your knees
and you would tell the girl hey I love
you but I know my love is not enough so
I want to bribe you with a diamond ring
because diamonds are considered to be a
symbol of love and I will pause here for
a second what makes a diamond the symbol
of love diamonds are considered to be a
symbol of love only because of how
expensive diamonds are because they are
hard to obtain
there are solutely no use of a diamond
and we just value it because of how hard
it is to obtain it rather than how
useful it is but what if we do something
different just close your eyes for a
second and just try and visualize that
you&#39;re my girlfriend and I&#39;m trying to
ask you out for marriage so I go down on
my knees and first of all I&#39;m really
sorry I&#39;m making you visualize that
you&#39;re my girlfriend but this is the
closest I can get to having a girlfriend
so I go down on my knees and I give you
a box you get really excited and I tell
you hey I love you
but I know that you love the TV show
friends mode so here is a pendrive of
all 10 seasons of friends
and instead and of the money which I
spent on a diamond we&#39;ll go on a
one-year honeymoon like what would be a
reaction like most people at least in
today&#39;s time instant rejection why I
don&#39;t understand like what is so great
about a diamond ring I&#39;m still waiting
for the time when the honeymoon industry
becomes as big as the diamond industry
just imagine the amount of money all of
us could save if we started gifting our
girlfriends Upendra with to her favorite
TV show rather than diamonds like
sometimes the easier choice makes so
much more sense and this mentality of
valuing hard other than useful is
prevalent across all over the world but
in India we take it one step further
the Indians we love difficult things and
it is no coincidence that Indians are
obsessed with diamonds they obsess with
fasting for weeks just to prove a point
we obsess with certain colleges just
because of how difficult it is and the
media plays a big role behind this
because the media always glorifies
difficult things you climb Mount Everest
and you&#39;ll be a national hero and you&#39;ll
be on the newspaper on the front page of
the newspapers the next day but if you
help one child get educated for one year
no one will care
why because helping one child get
educated for one year is very easier and
way more boring than climbing Mount
Everest and right now the biggest trend
that I keep seeing on social media is
running marathons and I know a lot of
people whose lies the gasps dream is to
run a full marathon of 42 kilometers
even though it is scientifically
extremely unhealthy and unhealthy to do
so and it&#39;s really bad for your kidneys
running a 5k or a 10k or a half marathon
makes much more sense way healthier for
you but of course running a full
marathon or faldo kilometers will get
you more likes on Facebook and it&#39;s way
cooler but just try and imagine that
someone&#39;s biggest dream in life is
something which is harmful for them this
China Marine that&#39;s crazy and at the
same time I would
to acknowledge that one of the biggest
advantages of doing difficult things is
that it makes us more mentally tougher
and it makes us realize what we are
capable of and someone who climbs a
Mount Everest or runs a full marathon is
mentally tough enough to deal with other
complex life problems so I would assume
that someone who climbed Mount Everest
would never commit suicide because of
how many obstacles they&#39;ve already faced
previously in their journey but at the
same time as great it is as it is to
test our limits there is a line which we
frequently cross we&#39;ve become obsessed
with checking items off our bucket lists
by doing one hard thing after the other
without stopping to think is there any
benefit except an ego boost if all of us
chase exclusivity then we just become
unexcusable stupid and I want to ask you
today if I tell you hey your life is so
easy how would you react if I tell you
here your life is so easy how would you
react you would probably get annoyed or
defensive but why leading and happy and
easier life is better than leading a
harder life other things remaining the
same similarly if I ask you if I tell
you hey you have so much free time once
again instead of being happy you would
probably get annoyed or defensive
because we&#39;ve been made to believe that
being busy is synonymous with being
successful when actually being busy is
equal to just having poor time
management skills as you reflect on your
biggest life&#39;s goals I want to ask you
what makes you do what you want to do
are all your goals be re centric or I or
goals value centric and I want to end my
talk today with a quote from my book
self phenomics
don&#39;t just try to be excellent try to be
excellent in something which is useful
thank you
you
