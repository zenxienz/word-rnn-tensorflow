dan roshani high Ripa is a freezing
catch for that in English means starting
in a land far away and not too long ago
I learned about a 12 year old boy coming
in love with the foreign land
he worked shiny shoes and selling
newspapers in La Plaza de Armas which is
one of the most touristy streets in the
city of Cuzco and he walked considerable
distances in the course of a day shining
the shoes of many people in the city and
from the stories he got to here and
people who got to meet he was
particularly drawn to those coming from
the United States years later he just
finished school and time aligned just
right for a program called the Visa
Lottery which is a highly sought at u.s.
immigration visa to accept applications
from Peru because Peru was identified
among some of the countries with low
immigration rates to the United States
in the early 2000s and it is literally
by luck of the draw that you get chosen
and he form part of the like you feel
and you could just imagine he was
extremely excited as if he&#39;d actually
won the million dollar lottery and this
extremely excited young boy it was my
dad he embarked on this journey with the
rest of our family shortly after and
similar to him many people today leave
their home for a number of different
reasons
people leave their home as migrants has
internally displaced people who are
those fleeing their home within their
country&#39;s borders there are also people
who leave their home is asylum seekers
in his refugees where those forced to
flee due to persecution conflict and
natural disaster and I want to school
with many of these kids who loved their
home country along with their family for
a better future
but you see school was also where I
first encountered light-skinned American
kids from predominantly white
backgrounds who opened my eyes just a
little bit more to how I was perceived
in this culture I would often be
referenced as brown and I remember as a
kid learning English taking that quite
literally in fact I remember convincing
my mom to buy me a set of Crayola
crayons for a school experiment
and one by one I align my fist through
the brown pieces in the box
tire sleep and I mean tire sleep trying
to match my skin with the brown crayon
in hopes of finding relatable and
affirming ways to define who I was but
you see comments like these became less
and less than usual because really we&#39;re
all programmed to notice difference
I&#39;m not saying be cool about it but we
all notice skin color in fact our brain
is hardwired with an evolutionary legacy
to divide the world we live in into two
groups the us under them where we are
often kind tolerable understanding
empathetic to people we consider an
anger member and we&#39;re completely the
opposite to people we can set an
accurate remember which is for them or
the other and people coming from migrant
refugee asylum seeking backgrounds often
fall in one of these two groups
but you see this type of group
membership often favors in-group members
at the expense of out group members and
I thought this whole concept play out a
couple weeks ago when I visited a town
in Greece located in Keke&#39;s there was a
very apparent division the locals on one
side and a handful of nonprofit
organizations on this other side and
these were organizations specifically
serving refugee families coming in from
Turkey to Greece and there was a very
apparent divide a number of these
organizations considering Greece&#39;s
current tough economic crises as well as
the established tech community people in
that little town a lot of them but all
the locals perceived the new families
coming in as Vernis BC that changed when
these organizations decided that they
would rather invest in the town small
businesses to buy the furniture supplies
they needed rather than going like eeeh
and they did this intentionally because
in this process let they let the locals
know about who these refugee families
were the makeup of these new families a
little by little believe it or not a lot
of the locals found they had a lot of
things in common
and vice-versa and they were these new
families were soon described as assets
to their community rather than burdens
but more than that were described as
actual human beings and I would often
wonder what about if it were up to you
or me to build her own little town or
society from scratch where things could
be a little more fair and less divided
like in giggy&#39;s and one of my platonic
crushes of all times philosopher John
Rawls proposes the veil of ignorance as
the way of seeing things in a different
light
he says that behind this imaginary veil
we don&#39;t know anything about ourselves
we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know our age
nationality gender occupation the power
we hold in that new society behind this
veil he says that then we would strive
for a more fair and just equitable
Society and philosopher bets take this
even further and he says behind this
veil we are all potentially refugees
that refugees are ordinary people in
exceptional situations and the same
stands true for any other group
exemplifying human mobility today but
now imagine this that you don&#39;t know if
you&#39;re brown black or white you don&#39;t
know if you&#39;re rich or poor you don&#39;t
know if you&#39;re healthy or sick you don&#39;t
know if you&#39;re female male or identified
within the LGBTQ community you don&#39;t
even know if you&#39;re Muslim Catholic or
an atheist just to name a few of course
behind this veil in this new society how
what do you think of immigration policy
how would you feel about immigration
policy and this is where it gets a whole
lot more interesting for me because I
arbitrarily asked a hundred people what
they would do to be more kind to
tolerable and understanding to people
from refugee asylum seeking and refugee
backgrounds including migrants and 95%
of the immediate response I would get
consisted of a four letter word and it
was help not the type of help that you
would scream if your house is on fire or
if you got in a pool not at all the type
of help that would go along the lines of
responses like this well I would
volunteer I would be more generous with
my
I&#39;m I would be kinder to people and do a
community service project and you see
that&#39;s a great start but it&#39;s also
problematic one and here&#39;s why because
how P needs different things for many
different people and for some it&#39;s a
checkbox on a to do list
often driven by self-interest as he I&#39;m
guilty of this I formed part of that 95%
well and I also decided to go and help
specifically help rebuilt the community
center right in the plaza of the town
and kikis with a group of students we
rolled up our sleeves and began painting
the wall arranging the furniture and
decorating the room until one man from
Syria in the room came in and he said
stop he said I don&#39;t need you to paint
the wall arrange the furniture decorate
this room I can easily do that myself I
would love someone that I could have a
conversation with or join me for a
family lunch there was complete silence
in the room and to be completely honest
with you I was actually expecting a
thank you because of all the hard work
dedication time it&#39;s what I&#39;d put into
that project the Fitz man was right I
had lost complete focus on the point of
the project but more than that this man
in front of me also has dreams
aspirations desires and a family could
be me could be you could be my parents
could be a brother an uncle
and what about of their work you know if
it were you how would you feel about a
group of people coming in to help you
without being a hundred percent crystal
clear on what you need help with or if
you need help with at all and everything
I was taught in Western culture
backfired and I asked myself so is
helping alone is not the answer
to moving past this us and then
mentality then what is and I&#39;m trying to
wrap my head around this I&#39;d often
wonder well how did people in the past
managed to solve issues or division is
so prevalent like it is now and I think
we&#39;ve actually had the answer for a
pretty long time and it&#39;s really a
simple one but first I know I had to do
some soul-searching and that part of my
identity are my cultural roots and go to
my ancestors identity are three
cornerstones which they called the three
cornerstones of the Inca law and in
Quechua that goes like this
I&#39;m a sua I&#39;m a que ya am i you yeah
which translated to English means do not
steal do not lie and do not be lazy and
I&#39;m here to propose these three things
but with the twist number one do not
steal don&#39;t steal from others the
opportunity of getting to know you like
the 12 year old boy from Cusco talked to
others interact respect and socialise in
communities that are different than
yours where you can engage in reciprocal
learning because that is key and perhaps
one of the things you learn and this
might sound totally crazy is that a
refugee camp is not a zoo and that a
migrants experience goes beyond then
that documentary you watched on Netflix
the other day number two it&#39;s not lie
don&#39;t lie about what you don&#39;t know
anybody you&#39;ll ever meet like this man
from Syria knows something that you
don&#39;t and taking that from a humbling
starting point but rather than saying oh
I I know a whole lot because I&#39;ve taken
this very intensive class or I&#39;ve read
this really good book or even I&#39;m super
active on this particular issue on
Facebook this was a shocker oh I want a
broad no you come from a place of
learning where you are at the edge of
your seat not because you&#39;re winning an
argument but because your mind has
opened up to so much more and number
three don&#39;t be lazy don&#39;t be lazy with
your everyday language just being a
little more intentional about how you
first introduce someone with their full
name prefer gender pronoun story or
strength that you admire from that
person makes a huge difference
like the organizations in khakis dead
have you ever wondered why you often
hear refugee child refugee parent maybe
on the media from another person rather
than hearing child&#39;s with refugee status
or parent with refugee background
there&#39;s a big difference between the two
because the term refugee itself is not
someone&#39;s full identity it&#39;s an
experience in circumstance in the moment
like it is for many other identities and
I&#39;m a sua I&#39;m a gay yeah I&#39;m a you yeah
or three things you can easily easily
put into practice today and can go a
long way and they were three principles
that my dad as a boy called true - and
even though coming to the United States
was not all unicorns and rainbows I know
that some of his and my whole family&#39;s
most cherished memories in this country
has been when we felt included and part
of something bigger and even though this
will us-and-them
rhetoric and mentality might feel like
ripping off a band-aid because it is
painful it is complicated
we shouldn&#39;t get rid of it because it
would be nearly impossible to do no we
should move past it and cherish it
because there is no other we are all the
other I promise you unexpected
opportunities will present themselves in
your lives where you will be able to
steer away from stealing lying and
laziness in that process let those know
in your circles that we are in it
together that we are on the same side
the side of solidarity equity and
compassion for others a close mentor of
mine once said but the migrant crisis is
our generations civil rights movement
and so I say let&#39;s start focusing on
what unites us rather than on what is
dividing us thank you
[Applause]
