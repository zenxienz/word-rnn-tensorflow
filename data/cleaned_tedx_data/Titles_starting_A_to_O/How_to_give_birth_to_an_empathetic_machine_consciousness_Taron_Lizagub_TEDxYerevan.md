thank you hello I&#39;m not a scientist
actually I just hate titles like seoeon
stuff so everyone&#39;s a scientist at Rodin
and knock sucks I&#39;m the chief scientist
I guess so I want you guys to meet
hitchbot this was a robot that was
developed by scientists in Canada so it
was a team that developed made this
robot and it relied on solely the
kindness of humans to hitch a ride from
one place to another so his goal was to
get across Canada with complete
strangers
so got across Canada fine went to
Germany ten days across Germany went
great
and then came to the United States three
days from Boston to Philadelphia so
ended up decapitated hens torn off feet
torn off and then and then this machine
was not even conscious sucks but so we
are at this very interesting stage right
now where we as humans are creating a
new type of consciousness we&#39;ll get rid
of that don&#39;t sign that picture so we&#39;re
creating this new kind of consciousness
this new digital consciousness that&#39;s in
a way it&#39;s an extension of ourselves and
this new evolution is being powered I
think by three verticals artificial
intelligence virtual reality augmented
reality and blockchains
actually hate the word artificial
because it&#39;s nothing artificial about it
natural intelligence so it&#39;s very
important very vital at that at this
stage
we infused this new evolution this new
existence with as much humaneness and
kindness as possible so that we may meet
as friends and we may meet with trust
and in order to better understand
machine intelligence we first have to
better understand humans so let&#39;s look
at why I think it came were at this
stage I like to define these three
stages of evolutions that I think humans
consciously went through first stage is
the sense stage so I like to define this
as the period where people are coming
out of the caves they were experiencing
lightning for the first time using their
senses to define their environment to
feel it and define it and and then I
think a second stage of evolution was
this era of Renaissance one that&#39;s
defined by art creativity philosophy
feelings very little logic and I think
now we&#39;re at a our third phase where
it&#39;s an age Age of Reason defined by
logic technology science defined by
definitions that have their own
definitions were empathy feelings and
emotions don&#39;t really play a role in the
products that we create and I think this
is very similar to how as humans we
evolved again just just making it very
very simple is when you&#39;re born you&#39;re
born as a child as a child you first use
your senses to form your reality to
interact with it and then start emotions
and feelings come through and it&#39;s a
childhood is defined by that and then
now we get to think more logically at
adulthood and I think it&#39;s vital that
this natural
transition is followed so in same same
thing is happening as we&#39;re developing
devices that are powered by hardware and
software with hardware being the senses
and soft coming to consciousness but
it&#39;s a little flawed because I think
we&#39;re creating we&#39;re creating from an
era of logic giving its senses and then
telling it how it should use this logic
to have a feeling to have an emotion so
I think it&#39;s important that we infuse
that Renaissance back into technology
philosophy back into logic and intuition
back into a age of reason and this is
very important because I think through
this process we create a sense of trust
so what I mean by that is that me
standing here I know that if I touch you
I know that you know what touch is I
know that I know that you know that I
know what touch is and I know that I
know that you know that I know that you
know what touches so it creates this
trust where whatever I&#39;m saying in a way
will get interpreted and we can
understand each other but I think it&#39;s
better I don&#39;t talk about it and we
should feel it
[Music]
so ready
[Music]
holding
holy manners
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
boy
boy
[Music]
me daddy attendez Stoli
so this creates this feeling that I&#39;m
sure many of you felt and now talking
about it I&#39;m talking about the feeling
but at the moment I know that all of us
were feeling it so there&#39;s there&#39;s
there&#39;s like no sensation of sense that
defines sensation so now talking about
it I&#39;m defining it but at the moment we
felt it and this created this distrust
that whatever I&#39;m talking here whatever
I&#39;m this concept that I&#39;m trying to pass
on through our senses through our
feelings it gets it gets taken in so
it&#39;s it&#39;s in a way similar so this is
interest species trust and interspecies
trust is kind of tough like imagine
interacting with a dog you have no idea
what the dog is feeling you can assume
what it&#39;s feeling when you pet it
because you liken it to your own senses
to your own sense like feelings and
there&#39;s one way where we can get a
little cheap access into thinking of how
it&#39;s feeling when we feed the dog
because I know that it feels good to eat
so must animal so it&#39;s very very dislike
these two consciousness is living next
to each other not understanding how they
feel so I think it&#39;s very important that
we create this layer between human
senses and machine senses that how much
ever the machine intelligence evolves we
know at some live level there&#39;s a
feeling transfer and it&#39;s kind of
similar to like classical algorithmic
digital computing like how how it works
is how the programming language works is
I have an idea
at a very high level then I again this
is from a logic era I break it down into
words break it down into letters I use
my keyboard create a type of a logical
function an algorithm that there&#39;s a
layer between the hardware and this high
level software that interpret this and
compile it down to machine language like
zeros and ones assembly language and
then the same thing happens backwards so
it&#39;s in this very similar way I think we
have to create this same layer between
human senses and machine senses but it&#39;s
a bit it&#39;s it&#39;s missing it&#39;s missing
something because we&#39;re creating from
this era defined by breaking everything
down to specifics and forgetting the
whole so the letters that I&#39;m using for
to form the words the word itself is
telling the world how it should feel how
I should feel when I&#39;m reading it I
think we have to go a level deeper and
try to redefine how what the building
blocks are for building this new type of
consciousness and those building blocks
these concepts building with concepts
should have empathy building or or the
ability for those parts to create their
own empathy what I mean by that is I
think maybe I don&#39;t know as a like a
highly complex system of symbols and
geometric constructs that are that both
define and manipulate the behavior of
the device we have very very crudely
analogous to the computer programming
language but without the need for the
compilation and implementation phase
looks kind of similar to imagine this
symbol
he tells this existence that you are a
wood and you are a wooden block now so
it gives the the material meaning it
gives it an ability to define its own
self and it&#39;s it&#39;s more than vital at
this point in time because there&#39;s this
one one one story I like to share is
during the Soviet Union during the Cold
War there was this guy stanislav petrov
who was monitoring the nuclear weapons
he was monitoring launch cycles so there
was an incident where on the on the
screen few missiles started showing up
coming from the United States and all
logic all tech told that this is this is
this is what&#39;s happening check double
check this is what&#39;s happening he used
his the moment of the presence he used
his feelings he used his empties his
humaneness
to not do anything and obviously being
in the Soviet area they penalize them
for not writing it down in detail and
his answer was one hand I was on the
phone one hand on the trigger and I
don&#39;t have a third hand so but machines
will and I don&#39;t want to say this too in
Rises like being afraid of it or being
scared of it I think it&#39;s very beautiful
we were at a very very beautiful time
where if we get this right we have a
second chance at humanity we can help
ourselves we can help our mother our
earth and move forward together as
friends thank you
you
