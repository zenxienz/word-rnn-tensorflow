hello everyone my name is Andrew bottom
and I&#39;m an English teacher right being a
teacher I am the constant search of
effective tools of expanding my students
learning potential though I have never
taken any special courses and no special
training in drawing in spite of the fact
but they&#39;re not a nice at all
well I draw a wild dish in English I
draw for teach in English well I&#39;d
better put like this I teach my students
drawing for better learning English
right you see quite strange isn&#39;t it
English teacher teaches drawing well
logic isn&#39;t my strong point and it has
never been but first things first let me
show you something this is my visual
profile and I&#39;ve got a task for you
because I&#39;m a teacher I&#39;m clean on tusks
look at it in five seconds try to come
out with the ideas what every picture
stands for or in other words how every
picture is connected with the
personality of the speaker you know I&#39;m
not shy at all and not modest so 15&#39;s
PCPD what does it mean please come out
with ideas maybe okay what else
ESP right CPD best audience ever really
I&#39;m an English teacher and university
lecturer with more than 15 years of
professional experience right I&#39;m a PhD
holder which is my thesis I&#39;m very proud
of it I&#39;m associate professor of foreign
languages Department and taras
shevchenko Chernigov national teacher
training University my research
interests include teaching adults
English for specific purposes continuous
professional development that&#39;s why I&#39;m
here and I&#39;m especially keen on bringing
innovative teaching techniques into
language classroom now let&#39;s get down to
the second picture for someone it might
look like a seaweed or a jellyfish or a
monster with many many heads and many
many legs but for you what is that can
you say what idea comes to my mind when
you say it right perfect right so this
crowd is my students over the years I
have been working
in different private and state education
establishments teaching various English
language courses for people of all ages
and my students are difficult to count
and the number keeps growing every
academic year my former students who
work in different fields from politics
and medicine to agriculture and computer
science some of them have become my boos
and friends some of them are my
colleagues already these people are the
source of inspiration for me and the
subject of my pride I feel so happy when
the students of mine achieve much more
than I did write pitchy number three
that is the easiest one to explain what
is that Oh perhaps right good idea what
else okay good try anything else
actually actually this is my family
these two handsome men
I&#39;m a husband to my son they&#39;ve got
lettuce a on their stomachs Zambia
t-shirts right because their name start
with a Alex a is for my husband and our
Thomas for my son I drew Adam here cuz
you know their names who will be
mentioned further on in this story and
there is another reason they play a
significant role in my personal growth
and in my professional development and
under grateful to them and they are the
subject of my utter affection to tell
the truth right now let&#39;s get down to
pitch number four that is very close to
my talk today what&#39;s that right Joe and
that is my passion
and that is my hobby actually not draw
in itself cause I&#39;m not very good at it
scribing lately there&#39;s a great buzz
over internet which has to do with
graphics and design you might have have
come across such terms as visual
facilitating visual note-taking
sketchnoting doodling scribe in art
scribing they&#39;re all about capturing
spoken information with the help of
simple drawings well I&#39;ve been inspired
to start scribing by two great men the
first one is Graham Shaw he&#39;s British
business consultant and business trainer
his TED speaker as I am now I&#39;m proud of
it
and he is the author of the book
catonian for learning and the second
person is Agatha Bologna who created the
school of visual facilitating and art
scribing in Chernigov where I am from
and he gives very successful master
classes all away crane and even abroad
when I was participating at one of his
schools an idea came to my mind well if
I can scribe and there is fun I wanna
share this fun with my students okay
well this two great men managed to
persuade me that I can draw and now I&#39;m
sure that everybody can draw at least if
you can draw something like a line right
a squiggle or a do what you definitely
can draw right so we&#39;re all able to draw
something at least to communicate the
idea but then you might ask me how
drawing is connected with learning and
how can drawing expand our teachers
potential actually to a great extent and
then challenge race from my own
experience and now I got a question to
you have you ever had problems
remembrance things can you raise your
hands if you have any problems remember
things yeah I see that many people know
what I&#39;m talking about when I was a
school girl the way I used to learn
something was like this I had a text
which I had to learn the Technic page
right so I read it and then we read it I
even tried to rewrite it and co-op it it
for many times trying to remember it of
course reading and writing is a great
way to remember something well but when
I turned over the textbook page my mind
was blank and my expression was like
this well when I turned over the page of
the textbook when I close my eyes the
only thing I could remember was layout
of the textbook page I could really
recall the title of the text in the
upper case in the right upper corner I
could even clearly see the picture
illustrating the title in the left upper
corner and I could easily recall the
number of paragraphs below under the
title it was quite easy for me I was
able to describe in details the picture
illustrating the paragraph but the
contents of the text remained vague and
uncertain to me so at that time being a
kid I understood that my mind likes
pictures much more than the text but how
to learn verbal information how to learn
text well I got my personal solution and
biology lessons when my class started to
learn biology in the fifth or sixth
grade well we had a brilliant biology
teacher all students cheat and all
teachers know that sometimes students
cheat right our biology teacher was so
great that she allowed us to use our
cheat sheets at the tests unless they
contained any single word no words at
all on the scheme&#39;s
diagrams pictures simple drawings and
whatnot and biology was just a piece of
cake for me
and my classmates even today being woken
up at night I can draw the scheme of
photosynthesis or the scheme of water
circulation in nature that is quite easy
for me at that time I made my personal
discovery journey in text into simple
drawings makes information memorable at
least for me from that time on I
continued to use this simple trick every
time I needed to remember something at
school at University
getting ready for the tests or exams
even going shopping the first person I
entrusted my secret to was my son by the
way what&#39;s his name yeah that&#39;s right
there John
you know he&#39;s quite a cute guy he is
used to settle all his school matters by
himself but once he came up to me with a
great problem
so my son for the first time in his life
couldn&#39;t learn the poem why because the
poem was too big
it contains 40 lines in ten quote trains
and by the way it contains a lot of
repetitions and homogeneous parts well I
wasn&#39;t sure that my trick could work for
my son but nevertheless we worked for a
little while and we scribed every line
of this poem and he learned the poem in
no time
the next time well the next day when he
returned home from school right he wrote
an excellent mark and two new friends
the case was that he taught his new
classmates the same trick and they could
recall the poem in no time that was very
very easy right this was the first time
when my when I used simple drawings to
teach other people actually my son
taught me how to use simple drawings to
teach other people would you like to see
our sketch I&#39;m gonna show it to you okay
but again here is a task for you look at
the sketch and try to guess who is the
author and what is a poem okay what&#39;s
that
that&#39;s right that is Volodymyr Sosua
outstanding Ukrainian poet Levitch
Ukraina and I think that occasion is
marvelous for us for everybody to recite
this great poem at least to first
quatrains are you with me let&#39;s do it
all together in full voice Lube it
Ukraina Jackson&#39;s Ruby yeah Kavita
etravel rewarding danishes level ever
addressed him with Blue Beach Hotel ooh
me holding the beach Ukraina Vesnina vu
which names for you Ukraine Oh Christine
which Naja vu in Abu Ammar will ye so do
you know you deserve thank you ever so
much you&#39;re a great audience thank you
so much I hope you&#39;re having fun but you
know there is a serious science behind
all of this experts say that the most
powerful way to remember something is to
create a mental image and then to draw
it to draw it physically researchers at
University of Waterloo in Canada have
found the drawing simple pictures of
information which needs to be remembered
is the strong and reliable strategy to
enhance memory well they&#39;d be drawing
again some other encoding strategies and
drawing always came out on top on every
stage of the experiment participants
could recall twice as many words which
were drawn than those which were written
well this benefit was labeled drawing
effect Canadian researchers believed
that everybody could benefit from this
effect and this this effect arises from
the fact the drawing helps to create
more cohesive memory trace which better
integrate semantic motor and visual
information importantly everybody could
better benefit from this effect
regardless he&#39;s a her artistic talent
because the quality of the pictures
didn&#39;t seem to matter at all
to some extent this memory principle is
widely used in primary school we&#39;re
drawing is a huge part of the curriculum
but as students grow older the teachers
tend to abandon the idea of drawing and
sold the students but personally I&#39;m
sure that we should revisit the idea
that drawing has
huge educational impact at my English
lessons even at university I use a youth
visual facilitating and art scribing not
only for creating a successful language
learning environment but also for
stimulating my students creative
thinking imagination and memory and now
it&#39;s high time to check your memory here
is a task for you again you know I&#39;m the
teacher and they work in different tasks
do you remember my visual profile which
would which I started my talk remember
look at the scheme of my visual profile
and right now close your eyes and try to
reconstruct at least five facts about
the speaker today by fact what 15 years
of wood right number one very good cool
thank you
what else perfect the best audience ever
you see simple pictures can work
perfectly okay all teachers can use
similar profiles every time when we need
to start a new academic year when we
meet a new group such simple drawings
can help me as warm as they help me to
switch my students over into English
here to tune them into English after
other subjects chemistry or physics or
high mathematics what not they help me
as icebreakers they help me to stimulate
or encourage cooperation and interaction
today it helped me to melt the ice
between you and me such simple drawings
can be can serve as any pre activity
we&#39;re reading prewriting pre-listening
if I want to build a logical sequence
between the previous part of the lesson
and the next one I will show you
something more simple drawings can be
very helpful for learning phrasal verbs
or when we want to describe what is
happening in the story like this
statement figures I use very often
different emojis for a describing
psychological state of the person when
we learn feelings and emotions when we
talk about what about our feelings right
my students love speech bobs for
creating dialogues and for storytelling
if you can draw a little bit you can
create
soon you can draw somebody who is
looking happy
sorry yeah or somebody who is fed up or
maybe somebody who is puzzled a little
bit even learning grammar can be fun if
you can draw a little bit here is the
poster which we created with my students
summarizing the topic passive voice you
see everything we&#39;ve been talking about
this voice was simmer eyes with the help
of simple pour step we also created a
set of drills for practicing passive
voice if you look at this poster you
will see that there is no need to give
any instructions you just waste your
time if you given instructions students
on the look at the speech pattern and
they see the illustrations which they
have to describe and then they start
using this pitch pattern right now I
need your help
let&#39;s give it a try let&#39;s start with the
third picture and try to make a sentence
which describes it America very nice
right football was invented by the
English here and Hamlet right so you
recognize this outstanding man thank you
so much this is William Shakespeare my
students even dared to illustrate the
most sacred thing in the history of
English literature that is so nice of
Shakespeare and right now again a new
task for you look at the ascribing and
try to guess what is a sonnet and at
least two first lines I&#39;m sure you could
do that because everybody learned the
poems owner poems but sonnets of
Shakespeare at university over at high
school thank you so much my mistress
eyes are nothing like the Sun right and
now we have a great opportunity to
recite this poem all together I will
make the picture bigger and you will see
how it works
let&#39;s do it all together my mistress
eyes are nothing like the Sun coral is
far more red than her lips red if snow
be white why then her breasts are done
look here watch it
that is my favorite moment
yeah if hairs be wires black wires
growing her head I have seen roses
damask red and white but no such roses
see I in her cheeks and in some perfumes
is there more delight than in the breath
that from my mistress reeks I love to
hear her speak yet well I know that
music has the far more pleasing sound I
grant I never saw a goddess go my
mistress when she walks treads on the
ground and yet by heaven I think my love
as rare as any she belied with false
compare you see the last lines were
quite difficult to the straight is why
we wrote them
right as you see it is obvious that
picture is the easiest way to explain
the meaning of the word classrooms may
be fully equipped but they can&#39;t hold
everything and sometimes it&#39;s just a
market and the whiteboard write a piece
of chalk and the blackboard which can
save you you can draw something you can
build a mind map Ukraine can create a
cartoon visual facilitating in the
language classroom it helps you to grab
students attention
it helps you to encourage encourage
active participation and to boost
retention and besides teachers ability
to draw something on the sport to create
a miracle is highly appreciated by the
students of all ages right most of us
like drawing even if we know little
about it it all started with the caveman
and it still exists on the walls of
public places right in the toilets right
on the desks that&#39;s cool
right so you are very welcome to draw
for your students to draw with your
students just give it a try and change
the way you teach forever thank you
you
