what do you stand for what do you
believe in and what are the brands that
you love I&#39;m talking about perhaps the
football team that you&#39;ve followed since
childhood it might be the rock band that
you&#39;ve been a big fan of might even be
the pair of jeans that you always depend
on now
Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon said
that a brand is what they say about you
when you&#39;re not in the room so if you&#39;re
saying great things about those brands
the brands that you love chances are
that you believe in them that they have
integrity and so as we reflect on what&#39;s
happening in the world right now it&#39;s no
surprise that when the Edelman report
was published at the beginning of this
year it revealed that we have a crisis
of trust a trucker crisis of trust
amongst large organizations and
institutions now just look at the news
stories today as we look at all the
various news media from the worlds of
politics to big business it once trusted
institutions much love brands the retail
landscape has changed immeasurably since
2008 in the credit crunch even great
figures from the world of sport have
been taking shortcuts to victory and
behind it all is a crisis in trust and
we&#39;re losing that trust in brands it&#39;s
as if those individuals have lost sense
of purpose now I don&#39;t really understand
that every organization needs to make a
profit
of course it does but I believe that
purpose could be something much stronger
much higher a higher ideal if you like
essentially a value in fact some of the
greatest brands in the world are led by
purpose a strong sense of purpose in the
world of automobiles we have Volvo a
brand driven by an ideal of safety if
it&#39;s not just safety of the users of
those cars the drivers but it&#39;s also of
other Road
users cyclists with light reflective
paints that have been developed to
ensure their safety in the depths of a
winter we see the three points safety
harnesses in in Volvo cars that
technology freely given away so that
other automobile manufacturers can use
it
driven by an ideal of safety in the
world of retail we see the the giant of
the John Lewis Partnership founded over
a hundred years ago by John speed and
Lewis you know John&#39;s Ben Lewis had an
ideal for him it was the happiness
employees you know the partners in that
partnership you know they have a they
have a strap line it&#39;s a it&#39;s really a
mantra never knowingly undersold and
it&#39;s that knowledge that ensures that
the employees the partners in that
organization deliver some of the best
experiences in the retail world it
doesn&#39;t end there just look at the
brands like Apple according to
Interbrand the world&#39;s most valuable
brand and at the very top the chief
design officer sir Jonathan Ive a
British designer who&#39;s taken his career
from a young designer all the way
through that that giant of a brand to
the very top you know driven by an ideal
of creativity and it&#39;s his his work that
we see in everything from the iMac to
the iPhone today these are brands driven
by a keen sense of purpose above and
beyond just making a profit and those
purposes which you&#39;d like really a giant
value it can be ensured by a framework
of values and these values are really
really important to to help the
organization grow but they&#39;re only going
to work if they&#39;re led from the very top
the the author and consultant an Road
says that leaders drive values values
drive behaviors behaviors ultimately
drive the culture and it&#39;s the culture
that delivers performance so values need
to be led with conviction from the very
top of an organization and we can see
this with the British government laying
out British values British values are
democracy
rule-of-law individual liberty they are
mutual respect and tolerance of those of
different faiths and beliefs these
values that are essential for the
citizenship of the British in the United
Kingdom for British citizens are now
taught at school they&#39;re part of the
school curriculum so generation said
almost in what could be seen as a social
experiment are having these values woven
through their school curriculum so these
young people are now going out growing
up and eventually we&#39;re going into the
world of work expecting the
organization&#39;s that they work for the
end of those institutions to understand
values and to practice values so
therefore it makes sense that the large
organizations institutions employers
should understand the essential
importance of understanding their
purpose and driving it through a
framework of values you may feel that
you already have a values frame set but
are they fit for purpose Patrick
Lencioni the author of the book the
advantage describes four different
groups of values first group our core
values these are the values that you
have protect you would fight for did you
stand for they essentially really
determine the differentiator that set
you apart from everybody else not to be
confused with passion to play values for
permission to play values of the values
that really well if you&#39;re operating by
the rules of the country oh won&#39;t you be
trustworthy why shouldn&#39;t you have
integrity these are values that you earn
through practice but so often I see
businesses preaching that these are them
their main values but they don&#39;t really
fully differentiate you we have two
other groups of values that we can look
to accidental values accidental values
they&#39;re the ones that somebody who is a
stranger to your company will probably
see straight away I&#39;m talking about is
everybody in the company the alumni of
the same university is everybody part of
the same social group in fact are you
all part of the same demographic and so
necessary system but it could be
stifling it might be static and prevent
you to grow
and then the fourth group of values are
aspirational values now aspirational
values allow you to reach further to
achieve the vision that the brand has so
an exciting group of values these are
the values that can allow you to make
sure that you choose suppliers and
companies to work with that share the
same outlook as you that allow you to
stretch further and so with these four
different groups of values we suddenly
have a workable frame set in which we
can evaluate our values and provide a
wetter pattern of growth of these values
can then be used by HR communities to
recruit to evaluate the work that we do
to promote people I&#39;m assuming with the
brand of Apple how Jonathan Ive has made
his way to the very top as chief design
officer so he stands like a beacon you
know he&#39;s a really a great example of
what is expected of the employees at
Apple
so values can be really helpful in in
grow in developing and growing the brand
in fact they can make engagement you
know what is engagement well engagement
is when you love your job yeah and you
understand the part that you play in the
success of that organization the engage
for success movement describes for
drivers that are essential to to
engagement and it begins with a
strategic narrative now that strategic
narrative is the story of how you
started the business and where you&#39;re
going - is it inclusive is it exciting
is it uplifting is it driving is it
going to make you want to be a part of
that now the second driver is engaging
managers and that&#39;s the huge importance
of line managers not just the senior
management team but line managers who
can take the ideals and the ambitions of
the senior managers and put them into
practice they can they can watch their
colleagues and they can let them know
when a job has been particularly well
done they can Pat them on the back and
say I&#39;m really proud to be working with
you and that can be a huge lift for
everybody in an organization a few words
of encouragement often worth more than a
pay rise
and I mean that seriously and that they
they lift us we feel that we&#39;re a part
of something rule part of a team now the
next important driver of engagement is
employee voice miss Gibbs means today
each employee feels confident that they
can talk to somebody about their
engagement at work about how they feel
about the job that they&#39;ve got in fact
it can even give them the confidence and
the free will to be a whistleblower you
know often we need more people letting
us know when things are going wrong
clearly with some of the biggest
institutions some of the gross and
negligent behaviors that we have seen
the total abuse of power that has been
prevalent if only people had spoken out
earlier but yet it seems to work wait
until the very moment before these these
issues are identified so this is an
important part of engagement fight the
final driver engagement is integrity but
ultimately integrity comes through
bringing those values to life you know
walking the talk - bringing it bringing
those words absolutely to life in
practice yeah eight engagement provides
a confident workforce who understand the
idea of the brand and are able then to
innovate in the moments they can bring
the brand to life because your brand is
really three-dimensional it&#39;s ultimately
a time machine by which I mean that
lives the past the present in the future
now the past you know that&#39;s your your
reputation Benjamin Franklin&#39;s that it
takes many good deeds to build a good
reputation and only one bad one to lose
it and we&#39;ve seen multiple examples of
this in recent times again look at the
automotive industry the emissions
scandal
yeah and how that great intelligence
that wisdom and knowledge of the subject
that has been used to take shortcuts in
order to deliver a profit rather than
live up to the purpose a reputation is a
very hard thing to win back and then the
second dimension the present the here
and now you know to be relevant always
in everything that you do
driven by idea of purpose think of a
brand like Nintendo over a hundred years
old originally a playing card company
it&#39;s gone
through constant change it really
understands what it is the idea of play
we&#39;ve seen the way that goddess all
jumping up out of our sofas and running
around our front rooms engaged in a new
way of playing a console game and only
this year we&#39;ve seen the Nintendo switch
constantly changing disrupting the world
of play but staying true to its purpose
in the future tense the third dimension
we mustn&#39;t rest on our laurels we must
be true to who we are I&#39;m thinking of a
brand like Disney now I have two young
sons and my wife and I took our two boys
to Disneyland Paris now you may think
that we all understand what Disney is
about yeah we all know those characters
we&#39;re all familiar with them I&#39;m sure
many of us grew up with them they&#39;re
part of our own childhood memories
there&#39;s no different with my two sons so
there was a huge expectation of going to
Disneyland Paris but Disneyland Paris is
brought to life by the staff who work
there but fully engaged they&#39;re not just
called employees they called cast
members and that&#39;s because together
they&#39;re putting on a production yeah
they&#39;re making magical moments it&#39;s
magical moments that ultimately are the
real purpose of Disney you know
beginning with with Walt Disney himself
and those cast members often ask
themselves what would won&#39;t do and it
inspires them to bring magic to that
moment and for me real innovation can
happen through people interpreting a
situation and adding to it
so when I took my two boys to Main
Street at the end of a fun packed day
and we watched the parade of the main
characters make their way towards us my
wife and I noticed a couple with a
severely disabled son in a wheelchair
and we were yeah III saw them and I
reflected upon how much more of a
challenge it was for them to be there
today
I often grumble about how long it takes
to get my two sons out the front door
much harder for this couple but in a
blink of an eye some of those characters
from that Main Street parade field often
danced with them and to see their eyes
light up and their son looks so excited
then I really understood what a magical
moment was and the hailer of that spread
Bertha was something that I shared my
wife shared and I remember it vividly
today and this is what I mean by real
innovation dynamic in the innovation
driven grassroots by staff and employees
who feel liberated by a framework of
values they don&#39;t have to constantly ask
their line manager is it ok if I do this
they can automatically bring the brand
to life and so that the individual
ultimately can can innovate in the
moment creating new levels of touchpoint
we often talk about touch points with
touch points they&#39;re the menus shy of an
experience you may say ultimately we&#39;ve
got this purpose like a magical moment
but a magical moment which will be made
up of lots of individual details and we
need to be brave enough to break down
and deconstruct our brand experience and
then backed by the code of values ask
yourself is the brand fully coming to
life through this and does everybody in
the organization understand the role
that they play and that is determined in
bringing this brand to life now you know
if we look at engagement and ultimately
the touchpoint journey that begins with
an awareness and there are multiple
messages that may be shared in how we
broadcast ideas about our brands that
attract people and pull people in before
they engage in the present we have the
moment of commitment another raft of
touch points where we can ask is the
brand fully alive and so often the area
where we let the ball drop is in is in
commitment the third stage through
loyalty we would we&#39;re not looking after
our our clients and customers properly
if there&#39;s an issue or a problem or that
the the brand doesn&#39;t perform as well as
we expected where&#39;s the customer service
and that customer service again is an
opportunity to bring the brand to life
so touch points can be can be moments of
innovation where we pour more value into
the brand by understanding its code of
values of course the natural place for
innovation is through the creative
department
through the design team and this is
their role of course in order to add
significant value through through design
I&#39;ve mentioned sir Jonathan Ive but Sir
Jonathan Ive didn&#39;t get there on his own
you know all of us can draw inspiration
from that from other professional was
around us we don&#39;t even have to work
with the same companies as us so
Jonathan Ive drew inspiration from
dieter Rams dieter Rams is the German
industrial designer famous for his his
work with the with the consumer
electronics brand Braun
now dieter Rams developed a conscience
about the work that he was doing he was
concerned that ultimately he might be
adding to waste mountains of the world
by churning out more and more product so
boots himself 10 principles of good
design these principles essentially are
values and these values instructed him
in the work that he did and if it didn&#39;t
match up to those levels and it wasn&#39;t
going to be good enough and so Jonathan
Ive really chose a spiritual mentor that
could help him be to do the best
mentionable
and that&#39;s that&#39;s celebrated in in the
huge success of today it doesn&#39;t begin
and end there of course IBM perhaps for
more paintings than any other company
constantly innovating was driven by the
passion of one man Thomas Watson today
his name lives on in the stupid computer
Watson yo which is calculating the
imponderables the ultimate data science
machine but Watson had an idea and that
was simple it was think he asked all his
employees to think first and of course
we under we&#39;ve seen that through Apple
today it&#39;s been emulated in the notion
of think difference but Watson expected
nothing less of his employees and they
work with some of the most creative
teams of imaginable
Eero Saarinen the architects the design
team Charles and Ray Eames even their
corporate identity their ego is designed
by Paul Rand one of the greatest graphic
designers of all time it&#39;s unimaginable
that IBM would ever change their
corporate identity it&#39;s a beautiful
piece
design work I so they&#39;ve invested in
design consistently so we can see how
design can make a huge difference for
your brand&#39;s now ultimately it comes
down to culture I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard
the saying the culture eats strategy for
breakfast
so the best strategy for innovation has
got to be surely to get your culture
onside and that means everybody HR
internal comms marketing right across
the board every discipline working
together understanding the values
framework in order to create more
meaningful moments and greater levels of
engagement a better experience for all
and I&#39;ll leave you with the words of the
American poet and civil rights
campaigner Maya Angelou who said at the
end of the earth day they&#39;ll forget what
you said they&#39;ll forget what you did but
they&#39;ll never forget how you made them
feel
thank you very much
