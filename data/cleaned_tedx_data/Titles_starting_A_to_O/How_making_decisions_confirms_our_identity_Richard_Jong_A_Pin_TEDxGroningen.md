according to this year&#39;s Nobel Prize
winner in economics richard thaler the
world consists only of two types of
people humans and economists now before
I continue I would like to know whether
there are any economists in the room so
ok they are almost extinct so so well
I&#39;m an economist but sometimes I&#39;m human
too
like the other day I think it&#39;s what it
was a month ago that my daughter came to
me and told me that she wanted to sell
lottery tickets for a gymnastics club
maybe you are familiar with his lottery
and I replied the way daddies do I said
that&#39;s really a cool idea and without
further thinking I bought three tickets
and then she left the house and all of a
sudden the economists in me woke up and
the economists in me went online to look
up the prices and the arts of this
lottery and started to calculate the
expected return on investment well just
to show you what kind of gig I am here&#39;s
the proof and and you know what it&#39;s
really a bad investment
so the economists in me would never ever
buy such a ticket and the gambler in me
would not buy a ticket either because
any other lottery would be more
attractive to participate in and if I
would care about charity I everybody
would have been better off if I would
just have transferred my money
immediately to the gymnastics club so
there I was mister economist with my
three tickets and in the meanwhile my
daughter was selling these tickets out
on the street and I sort of felt sorry
for her so let me introduce you to my
daughter there she is
and let us just imagine that she would
ring your doorbell
would you buy a ticket if she would ask
you
I guess so right well it turned out that
within an hour she came home and she had
sold her entire booklet over 20 tickets
so I raised the question to myself why
on earth are we making decisions that do
not make sense from an economic point of
view are we stupid
well whereas the Economist in us makes
decisions based on costs and benefits
and by doing so optimizes what we call
his is instrumental utility the humans
the human makes decisions in a different
way a human does not only care about
instrumental utility but a human also
cares about his identity and he makes
choices to confirm his identity and this
gives him what we call expressive
utility now what do I mean I mean that
when we make our decisions we want to
tell other people but especially
ourselves who we are what we believe and
what we value and every time we do so
like for example being nice and
charitable to the little girl we feel
good about ourselves
now this feeling this is the expressive
utility I&#39;m talking about now you and I
we literally make thousands of decisions
per day we make decisions about what we
buy what we say what we do how we behave
etc etc and with many of these decisions
instrumental utility and expressive
utility are not in conflict so for
example when you buy your clothes or
when you buy a car in those situations
if you would like to confirm your
identity you have to put your money
where your mouth is and because of that
the expressive part and the instrumental
are perfectly in line but we are also
making decisions that have low cost and
low benefit and are completely
inconsequential to our lives in those
decisions we don&#39;t have to put our money
where our mouth is but still we open up
our mouth now does that mean that if we
are behaving like this
we are irrational are we stupid then
well in order to answer that let me show
you an equation because we economists we
love equations and so this is the
decision-making process of a human now
if we buy a lottery ticket
from a little girl we may obtain
negative instrumental utility but as
long as the positive expressive utility
of being nice and charitable is larger
than the loss due to D and Samantha
utility our total utility is positive
and hence we are not irrational we are
not stupid
now of course I&#39;m the first one to agree
that this example is completely harmless
so you may wonder why I&#39;m telling you
this now the reason that I&#39;m telling you
this is that the reason that I&#39;m telling
you this is that there are other
situations where our decisions are less
harmless and potentially really harmful
On June 23 2016 the British electorate
decided to leave the European Union in a
referendum that is better known as
brexit in the aftermath of this
referendum different polls and studies
have reported that over a million Li
voters by now regret the vote this is
about 6% of all casted votes and what
these people have voted remain then the
outcome would have been remained now
these so-called regret voters have been
portrayed by the media as being
amazingly stupid don&#39;t you agree but
what if I would come along and tell you
that these people
whereas stupid or as rational as you and
me when we buy a lottery tickets from a
little girl let me just do a comparison
between the two like buying a lottery
ticket voting has a small cost of course
you do not have to buy your ballot to
vote but you have to inform yourself
about the relevant issue and you have to
travel to the polling station and this
together takes time and you know what
they say time is money now what about
the expected benefit here it is also
like a lottery because the expected
benefit of an election also consists of
a price and a probability the prize here
is the policy outcome that you prefer
and the probability is the probability
that your vote is going to make the
difference between leaf and romaine now
a lis voter who wanted to remain but
voted leaf he&#39;s never going to win the
price so it&#39;s like a lottery it&#39;s a bad
investment but the value of this bad
investment has to be discounted by the
fact that his individual vote will be
decisive now in the British case which
with over 30 million voters it means
that the value it means that the
probability that he will be decisive
it&#39;s basically zero so the expected
benefit of his bad investment is also
practically zero now what about the
expressive utility here if you vote leaf
you may well be able to confirm your
identity of being dissatisfied with the
government or just your national pride
now if I would do the math here then
given the fact that the instrumental
part in the case of brexit has a value
of zero it is very likely that the
expressive part is going to determine
decision the I&#39;m sorry the decision so
voting leaf whilst you are in phase
of romaine is not stupid in fact
elections are just lottery tickets and
cute little girls in disguise now the
last couple of years my colleagues and
me have studied expressive voting
behavior in the research lab and if one
thing stands out then it is the fact
that people vote differently in small
groups when it&#39;s very likely that the
vote is going to matter compared to the
same situation in large groups where it
is unlikely that their vote is going to
matter now this is due to expressive
behavior and the consequence of it is
that what is optimal for an individual
can be suboptimal or even harmful for
the entire population now I hope you
realize that expressive decisions are
all over the place just try to imagine
how many of your decisions have low
costs and low benefit in fact in 10
seconds from now my talk is over and you
right afterwards have to make your very
next decision well I leave it up to you
where a debt decision is going to be
instrumental or expressive thank you
you
