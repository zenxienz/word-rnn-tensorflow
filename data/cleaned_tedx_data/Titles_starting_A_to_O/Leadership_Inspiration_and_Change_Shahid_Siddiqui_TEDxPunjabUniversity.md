the topic I chose for today&#39;s talk is
leadership inspiration and change and I
would like to that the very outset I
would like to unpack this term of change
change I see as a holistic phenomenon
which works at three different levels
first the belief level action level and
attitude level but the problem we see in
different organizations is that the
whole focus goes to action level and the
change at belief level an attitude level
is not tapped and the ultimate outcome
is that their change is not sustainable
I think we need to know something more
about this phenomenon called change
change is developmental which simply
means that if you have learned something
new and if you remain with that thing
for the rest of your life this is not
developmental change developmental
change always makes an angle that if you
have gone from status quo line up that
angle must be there throughout your life
change is painful because the practices
the ideas which are with you for such a
long time it is very difficult to part
with those ideas so change is always
very painful change is incremental you
should expect that the everything is
going to change overnight
it&#39;s very slow process and change is not
straightforward it&#39;s kind of zigzag
process you start with some idea you
think that this is going to happen
in its way there are certain constraints
and certain obstacles it&#39;s always the
exact process change in whites
resistance now what I&#39;m sharing with you
is based on my readings my observations
and my actual practice as a leader
whenever you want to bring some change
there is always some resistance from
some quarters so be ready for that
change needs are rational
why should I change so there needs to be
a purpose a cause a reason now I come to
my actual topic of leadership but that
background is very important because we
the ultimate aim is change some leaders
are one layer managers they focus on
just one layer of change that is actions
and they may comprise do things remember
that in the previous slide we mentioned
that changed needs are rational but here
these managers ignore that golden rule
they make employees do things they use
Authority in fear if you don&#39;t do this
this will happen to you
the whole emphasis is on what do this do
this do this
the other two very important WH
questions how and why they are totally
missing in this kind of management there
is partial
there&#39;s partial emphasis on how that is
why in this kind of paradigm there is
less emphasis on professional
development because these managers think
that professional development is not
very important thing so I call them one
layered managers the employees do not
know the why our rationale then this is
very important the relationship between
employees and manager is a master/slave
relationship the employees are always at
the receiving end they are there to
receive the instructions orders
everything is fixed there are structures
so there is no room for creativity and
you can imagine that if there is no room
for creativity what kind of place that
would be the workplace appears as a dull
and boring place so this is one scenario
where of one layered manager is leading
some organisation then we come to two
layered management where one layer of
action is there and the lead are the
managers who are leading the
organization do have knowledge about
that organization as well in the first
case the managers don&#39;t know anything
about that organization well in this
case the manager knows about that
organization for instance if it&#39;s a
university the manager knows about the
educational dynamics if it&#39;s a law
college the marriage knows about the
dynamics of law in this case the manager
possesses knowledge relevant to the
organization how part is improved
because that person knows about the
nature of that organization
the relationship remains master/slave
relationship and things remain fixed
workplace is very dull and boring but on
the other hand things are moving
organization are working right now here
I&#39;ll stop here and I&#39;ll share with you a
very interesting experience of reading a
book on portrait and the writer in that
book gives three laws that how a piece
of craft can be turned into a piece of
art law number one it&#39;s called law of
head that the Potter in his or her head
thinks about the shape of a part he or
she is going to make the second law is
law of hand in poetry the movement of
hand is very important because a little
twist if you have seen this process of
making parts you&#39;ll see that the wheel
is moving with a very fast pace and a
little twist of hand changes the shape
of the pot so the second law is law of
hand and the righteous says in that book
that after applying these two laws law
of head and law of hand
a perfect dead skeleton is ready let me
repeat after applying these two laws law
of head and law of hand a perfect dead
skeleton is ready and the title of this
book was the theme of this book was how
to convert a piece of craft into a piece
of art
then he says there is a third law and
thought that law is the law of love when
you apply this law you know the whole
thing becomes a life you infuse life
into that part now it is a piece of art
see law of head law of hand after
applying two laws a perfect dead
skeleton is ready so the part is there
you can use it but it&#39;s not a piece of
art it becomes piece of art when you
apply law of love right similarly after
applying these first two laws some
managers think that that is it
organization is running but something is
missing and that something is that life
and for that you have to apply the law
of love so far we talked about two kinds
of managers first manager was didn&#39;t
know anything about the organization and
focused on actions only he would make
his or her employees work do things by
using Authority are using fear in the
second case the manager knew something
about the organization this means
improvement in how but still why part
was missing now we go to the third
scenario here is the third layer this is
a three layered leader can
you spot what was missing in the
previous and what is present here the
attitude the passion the affection the
warmth the enthusiasm the inspiration
and here is a leader who is not driving
his or her employees through fear or
authority he&#39;s inspiring them
he&#39;s igniting enthusiasm but before he
ignites enthusiasm he himself
Archy him herself has to be excited
about things only then you can you know
communicate this enthusiasm or convey
this enthusiasm first of all this leader
is excited about what he or she is doing
that is prerequisite now immediately the
relationship shifts from me in you to we
it&#39;s not a master-slave relationship
here the leader himself is excited about
the vision and this is something which
was missing in the previous two
paradigms the leader inspires employees
through his or her vision gives purpose
cause meaning and why of actions so
this is the most important line that the
leader shows the dream to his or her
employees he gives he or she gives
purpose in meaning if you are doing this
why should you do this see the
difference in the old paradigm and this
paradigm that in the previous two
paradigms the manager had the ability to
make employees do things that&#39;s it but
in this case the leader is doing
something more in this case the leader
himself herself is excited about things
and he or she has the ability to make
others think the way he is thinking the
leader has the ability to make others
feel the way he&#39;s feeling or the way he
wants them to feel the leader has the
ability to make other see things the Hey
the way he would like them to see the
leader has the ability to make them
dream the way he would like to dream and
here the driving force of action is not
fear or authority but a purpose a dream
a cause a meaning and why now
no I&#39;m adding another very interesting
component to leadership and to me
this is perhaps the most important
component and this is the fourth layer
first layer was at
knowledge attitude this is fourth layer
this is creativity a leader is always
very creative innovative and for that he
reflects he or she reflects deep
thinking if you want to know you know
the details of this read Steve Jobs
autobiography starting with Mac
computers iPod iPad and then many joined
films you know constantly thinking
remember that initially I shared with
you that change is developmental always
making an angle the moment you stopped
this means that you have touched status
coline so for that it&#39;s very important
that leader is a thinking leader who
reflects what next what next you know
the beauty of dreams is that when one
dream is realized the boundary of
another dream starts when you achieve
that dream another dream starts and that
is kind of lifelong process that never
ends the leader has a car
to rock the boat to think out of the box
and when you think out of the box there
needs a lot of courage because working
in box is so safe that is your comfort
zone but you when you do something
different there is always some
opposition here let me share with you
some initiatives very briefly from the
University where I am coming from that
in that university we have started free
education for jail inmates and I
personally visited Central Jail quota
Central Jail karachi court Lakhpat jail
ideology met with the prisoners
motivated them and in this semester we
are having with us more than 1,000
prisoners who are getting education at
different levels at different levels
free of cost we provide them books
inside the jail we conduct do Turing
inside the jail
the assessment is done inside the jail
and they are engaged in a very positive
activity similarly in our university
special children any category of
disability get full fee waiver we have
another project which is free education
for drop of girls those girls in remote
areas who could not go to school for any
reason we provide them free education at
pre-literacy grade 5 and grade 8 level
similarly we started in accessibility
centre
for visually impaired children we have
got software that turns text into speech
so without any other help they wear
headphones they click any book or
research paper and that book starts
talking to them and after doing this in
our you know headquarter of Islamabad we
have 44 regional offices we have
established these accessibility Center
in 44 regional offices which are open to
non AR your students as well similarly
in the last semester we thought about a
very marginalized stigmatized segment of
society transgenders so allah my parafin
university is the first University who
announced free education for
transgenders and we are getting response
similarly as there are marginalised
segments of society there are some much
nice areas in Pakistan so from next
semester we are offering free metric
program to the students of bata and
Balochistan so the purpose is that you
know one way of doing is that you should
continue with whatever is there but as a
leader you should be thinking
out-of-the-box things that how we can
bring a change at individual level of
student and at societal level I think
what a leader needs to give to his or
her employees is trust
respect
and space to work and then the magic
happens if the leader is forced the
employees and you know encourages gives
them credit they you know gives you back
a very simple maximum for a leader is
give them the best and take best out of
them give them the enabling environment
and you&#39;ll see that how productivity is
enhance the leader like manager is not
just concerned about organization the
leader is concerned about organizational
development as well as individual
development because for a leader it&#39;s
very important that the employees
welfare how they&#39;re feeling is are they
comfortable how about their professional
development because as you say this is
human centric leadership this slide you
have seen as first light this was my
first slide so I&#39;m bringing it back
again
we started with slide saying that a real
change a sustainable change is that
change where which is holistic in nature
which is brought about at three levels
at belief level at action level and at
attitude level because if it&#39;s a action
level only it won&#39;t sustain there is
need that there is a change at belief
level as well
then had to do only then you know that
change is sustainable and this is my
last slide and I&#39;m summing it up after
showing you that holistic view of change
let&#39;s compare these two major paradigms
in leadership this is coercion versus
inspiration some managers they would
like to get things done by using
authority by instilling fear this is
coercive paradigm of management use of
fear and force to get things done and in
this case they touch just one layer of
change actions the other two layers
belief and attitudes are not touched on
the other hand inspirational paradigm of
leadership that uses inspiration
enthusiasm as a driving force that
enthusiasm emanates from a dream from a
meaning of life from a purpose from a
cause that is given by the leader and
then this kind of leadership touches
three levels of change the belief level
change the action level change and the
attitude level change and in the
you know short time I just I could share
with you that my own personal experience
is that use of force is not the way to
lead in organization it is incomplete
and misleading management style on the
other hand this inspiration this
participatory approach and this
enthusiasm that is the way and my
personal experience is that because I am
coming from a background I was just a
teacher a writer and this was totally a
different thing for me but my personal
experiences that I found this paradigm
more effective and more useful thanks
very much
you
