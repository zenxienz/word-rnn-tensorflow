just close her eyes please my name is
kun from Patil Berg I&#39;m a belgium
optometrist it&#39;s strange with your eyes
closed now you can open them welcome in
the world of seeing strange no seeing
nothing and seeing everything I hope
that that can bring you in my world but
my life changes after a car accident the
change total my personality also I was
one month in coma six months in clinic
and two years of rehabilitation start to
walk again store to use my hands again
I&#39;m blind on my left eye but I&#39;m here
still standing yeah still standing but
why I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not a saint
sometimes I feel me like a saint but I&#39;m
not a saint but every day I look to the
Stars I open my eyes and say to my God
thank you it&#39;s another day I have to do
something with that why I&#39;m here
I don&#39;t know there&#39;s no answer to that
but I wanted to do something with that
and that wasn&#39;t very important and
sometimes as an optometrist I was born
in a family of optometrist we are I
think we 12
my father is brother&#39;s children the
grandchildren yes in our genes I think
and we know I&#39;ve learned that a lot of
people have problems I problems how many
people here wear contact lenses glasses
Oh big business big business
so when you don&#39;t know which study you
have to do become enough temporaries
like me it&#39;s big business
yeah and you know worldwide 1 billion
people has no access we have access we
can choose
glasses lenses in operation but more
than 1 billion people worldwide have no
access but then I met this guy you know
him
professor Joshua silver it was an
inventor and I was watching through
television and his name is Professor
silver my friends call me sometimes
silver man I don&#39;t know why so he was
there on television as oh man oh man
real professor silver and he start
talking talking talking said oh he&#39;s
talking about classes so I met him and
you see maybe because of my accident you
don&#39;t meet people by accident I thought
I could fly with my car but and I met
him and it changes also my life because
when I put those glasses I turn on the
wheel said oh wow I can see ok left I&#39;m
blind
oh my right eye I have minus 3 it&#39;s
average but without I don&#39;t see nothing
maybe it&#39;s better to see nothing but I
was happy that I met him because it was
a new world I talked to Professor cotton
here in Antwerp she&#39;s one of the famous
professors for cornea problems I said to
her I met someone he has an adjustable
clasp with flute with liquid said I
don&#39;t know I was happy she didn&#39;t know I
met him and together we changed the look
a little bit ok I said to Joshua I don&#39;t
want to wear that so he appreciate me
and we change the look and I had the
ability to
Herbie the the social partner of our Red
Devils during the World Cup
and I met a beautiful woman mm-hmm
here she is do you know her no and she
said to me cool these are the glasses
for the future Coon did the Queen vendor
to comes
I said yeah majesty
I called her Majesty it gives people
children a future I love that statement
of her because it opened doors for me
and like best said I love the smiles on
people&#39;s face I love it
they give me positive vibes better than
fit amines vitamins in the pharmacy cost
a lot of money
a smile cost nothing zero but it gives
me positive energy and so nice I&#39;m not
the comic guy sometimes but putting
simple glasses on so on face and you get
a smile why are you so quiet it&#39;s by
working with Joshua silver one professor
of the state&#39;s contacted me he said kun
I heard about you during the World Cup I
want to meet you I said man I was six
weeks six weeks in in Brazil I don&#39;t
want to fly to to the States no no he
said I live in Brussels okay not so far
so I took my car and we met each other
and John Friedman it&#39;s professor and
anthropologist who works in the
university at the track and he met some
Dutch guys who are working with the
Alvarez principle it&#39;s another principle
it&#39;s not a fluid principle it&#39;s a
principle with two convex compact convex
concave lenses who slide to each other
simple like that I&#39;m gonna show you now
it&#39;s coming here come on
wow wow wow these are the glasses and
with a simple slide here to the wheel I
can see I have a minus 3 it&#39;s like a
binocular okay it&#39;s perfect
simple like that so with this I know we
are not going to win the first price of
the best design I know I know
but it&#39;s very easy all of you can be an
optometrist you don&#39;t need me and it&#39;s
important because there are not a lot of
optima trysts worldwide that&#39;s a problem
but everybody can help me
even my daughter of 14 can help you can
no explain you have to do like that zoom
zoom zoom zoom when you see stop easy I
like the simplicity my bro my
partner-in-crime John Friedman as an
anthropology anthropology he always make
from something simple something complex
for me I tried to find to do some simple
I&#39;m a simple guy so keep it simple it&#39;s
much easier believe me so and what we
want to do is giving everyone the right
to see it&#39;s very important you know all
of those who wear glasses when you don&#39;t
have him you don&#39;t see me maybe it&#39;s
better but it changed your life
so we give chances to people worldwide
and what I saw because I always work
together with eye doctors because these
are my partners in crime because this is
not commercial you know but doctors they
think different and you have the
knowledge so what I was in Brazil and in
South Africa I saw so much young people
your age every change and you have a
whole Patrick Patrick normally you think
it&#39;s my grandfather or my grandmother or
me but 18 to 20 years and the problem
was that the UV cost that&#39;s those
cataract
and when I flow back from Rio to
Brussels I said we have to do something
about that that&#39;s a better look no it&#39;s
like a little bit rock and roll but it
is personally are you lonesome tonight
right I can&#39;t sing
sorry so we created these pair of
glasses to help people young people for
protecting their eyes for UV and I think
the most beautiful part our factories in
Holland we work the assembling line we
work with disabled people and that makes
a difference because they are so happy
that they can make that because you know
we are helping people worldwide and we
love that by doing that and you know
with our lenses or glasses I can help
85% of all the people not 100% as an
optometrist I want to help 100% so what
was the problem and I&#39;m not going to be
the technical guy is asking that ISM
some of you have that problem yeah
there&#39;s more complex we have a half a
minus three so I am myopia however my
eye is it&#39;s like a football I like to
play soccer but those guys are resting
what is Rigby ball it&#39;s more complex
it&#39;s more complex so we try to find the
solution and we found the solution with
the I snap it&#39;s around simple round
glass and we can adjust the axis because
you have three parameters we are quite
difficult but by working with around
pair of glasses we pre-cut the lenses
that we can turn and snap them in and
with that idea we start wow what can we
do with that idea 2015 I had a project
here in Antwerp with the account that
closed on Antwerpen homeless people in
Antwerp I saw 600 people 155 we hope
with our focus back there
happy 60% of the people I saw were
Yeltsin and Peterson belgium&#39;s I could
believe I thought man that&#39;s not
possible I did a study and a lot of
people have financial problems in our
country and he can&#39;t afford a simple
pair of glasses so we created a new kind
of technology and created this pair of
glasses it&#39;s my daughter
made with love hmm yeah
she wears it it costs 10 to 20 euro
which glasses
not without loss with lenses not without
lenses you know 10 to 20 euro so we work
together with your same ways we try to
help people will try to doctors of the
world who don&#39;t have papers and we
really love it because looking good it&#39;s
confidence women always say yeah I look
to issues no no no no no no no first to
the face always and then the ice and
then okay the shoes but we always look
to the face and I want I don&#39;t want to
that people are Steve&#39;s eyes with our
focus specs I know these are the first
solution in the pyramid of seeing first
solution it&#39;s that it&#39;s nothing this
give already a good solution but that I
think it&#39;s better no not convinced huh
okay
by doing that I was with my part of in
crime from Accra to Kigali set jump we
can do something business with that
because you need money for helping
people you always need money I hate
money but you need money so we try to
think it a little bit of commercial and
we started a new brand face
in glasses I life I love this statement
is a statement of John my partner make
our vision your vision and your vision
their vision so what we do we are
selling glasses here in Antwerp
with our new brand with a buy one give
one so you buy one and you give one it&#39;s
always nice to help the people worldwide
I&#39;m a dreamer I think 90% of you are
also dreams it&#39;s important everything
starts with a dream believe in your
dream believing it bleeding is not
enough you have to do it do something
with your dreams it&#39;s so important to
dream maybe a little bit fantasy okay
but a dream believe in your dream and do
it and when you fail you fail whatever
you can&#39;t fail but you did it this is a
quote of Nelson Mandela a winner is a
dreamer who never gives up so never give
up your dreams because you can change
someone&#39;s life thank you all this is it
[Music]
you
