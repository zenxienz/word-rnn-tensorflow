hi I&#39;m a student I&#39;m sorry if I struggle
to communicate dictators who have sealed
my fate forced me only to dissect and
disintegrate until only the bones and
broken skin of what once was poetry is
left in my wake my lungs infused with
ink and my veins riddled with graphite
the entirety of my life decided before
I&#39;ve even been allowed to try hi I&#39;m a
student depression and anxiety root
themselves into my mind like a cancer
forcing me to believe that suicide is
the only answer encompassing my brain
like barbed wire are not designed to
keep the world out but designs keep me
in deemed a burden by those who wish for
me to be artificially intelligent hi I&#39;m
a student encased in a narrow-minded
dome set a light and left to burn as
they hope I&#39;ll be reborn into something
more pure living like the uphills and
mountains of the down hills of trenches
my brain treated like a toy battered and
bruised puppet masters who know exactly
which threads to pull make me dance for
the sole purpose of moving as my
individuality is erased
much like the mistakes which I&#39;m told I
constantly make my mind meant to be a
bottomless abyss in which the system can
continue to shovel it&#39;s never-ending
supply of bullshit in stuck living in a
world that&#39;s terrified of the word
different I wait to join the slowly
flowing ocean of mindless Wanderers
desperate to fall off the edge of the
earth who gravitate away from concepts
like love and happiness believing that
they show no worthiness instead seeing
everything as an invitation for their
condemnation I sit waiting for their
verification those who can find me
behind metal bars made of criteria who
tell me the mass and signs simply aren&#39;t
my areas I try to go off myself into a
place where society will never hear me
because it&#39;s far simpler for the world
to ignore problem than it cannot see as
they vomit their apathy onto me and my
life I attempt to mop it up with empty
promises and endless sacrifice exchange
they&#39;re cruel criticism for a chance at
redemption hi I&#39;m a student and no that
does not mean that I am plasticine which
you can mold into whoever society needs
me to be
you cannot pollute my mind the same way
you polluted my earth hi I&#39;m a student
but also a human not an ATM machine
I refuse to attempt to live off the
debris which you leave from me you
cannot expect me to stay silent and make
way for your animosity hi I&#39;m a student
not simply another senseless consumer so
political power brokers screw your raise
of 7.5% and keep your hands off of my
future
[Applause]
