so last week I went to my best friend&#39;s
birthday party in some ways were
complete opposites she&#39;s a wild cat from
the University of Arizona I&#39;m a Sun
Devil at Arizona State yeah yeah out
there Forks up she&#39;s a dog person and I
love cats and her major is electrical
engineering and I study political
science so at this party we were doing
your typical introductions what&#39;s your
name where are you from what are you
studying and I soon found out that every
one of her friends was an engineer as
well every flavor that you can imagine
biomedical engineering Chemical
Engineering Electrical Engineering
computer science so I dreaded the
inevitable question as we made our way
around the circle what are you studying
now when I typically introduce myself to
people as a political science major I
tend to get one of two reactions
the first is wow that&#39;s got to be
interesting at a time like this and the
second is good luck finding a job so I
was asked point-blank by a near perfect
stranger are you smart that&#39;s a little
more blunt than what I&#39;m used to but the
sentiment itself is common enough the
implication is that anybody with even a
small degree of intelligence would
pursue a degree in engineering in
medicine in the sciences because stem or
science technology engineering and math
is the backbone of our society today on
the flip side of that implication is the
insinuation that studying the humanities
or the social sciences is outdated less
important inferior or even a waste of
our time we tap stem as the crowning
achievement of our schools and in the
process we sometimes overlook the
classes that can be just as important
like English literature philosophy art
history and drama now it was my best
friend&#39;s birthday party after all and I
didn&#39;t want to make a scene so I just
smiled and nodded along but I&#39;ll tell
you what I wish I had said in the honors
program at my university there&#39;s a
required two semester sequence called
the human event under its official
description this course studies
landmarks in the social
intellectual development of the human
race from the seminal works of Western
antiquity like Plato&#39;s Republic and the
Iliad two philosophical texts by Marx
and Confucius we see some of the
greatest thinkers we&#39;ve ever recognized
struggle to put into words what it means
to be human
Karl Marx for example theorized that
capitalism led to the alienation of man
from man and from the species being or
what we might today call our humanity
now whether you agree with his economic
theories and their implications or not
when we read Marx&#39;s works we enter into
a dialogue with Marx and into a
connection with ourselves what makes me
human is it my ability to think or to
create isn&#39;t my ability to connect with
other individuals and if I didn&#39;t have
those things would I lose my humanity
now there clearly aren&#39;t universal
answers to those questions there are no
data to collect and no experiments that
we could reliably run but that doesn&#39;t
mean that our gut reactions are somehow
insignificant are meaningless and it
also doesn&#39;t mean that one discipline
alone can provide all the answers for
example some of the greatest minds in
science and mathematics have taken a
stab at this question in trying to
better understand our humanity Alan
Turing turned to an unlikely source the
computer according to the Turing test if
a computer can fool a human evaluator
into judging 30 percent of the time that
it is a human then it has successfully
passed the imitation game and can be
considered a machine that can think in
2014 a computer software program called
eugene goostman successfully passed the
Turing test at a rate of 33% but in the
last three years I don&#39;t think that our
society&#39;s collective definition of human
has broadened to the point where we now
include specific AI programs so
essentially we&#39;re back at the drawing
board wondering yet again what makes a
human a human and I don&#39;t have the
answer to that question but it&#39;s a good
illustration of how stem fields and the
liberal arts cannot be more important
than the other but instead must truly go
hand in hand
philosophical questions for example can
serve as a framework for technological
advancement for example when we think of
the murky ethical questions surrounding
cloning or artificial intelligence our
mind races with the many possibilities
presented to us in science fiction films
and literature but we tend to forget
that just twenty years ago we cloned
Dolly the sheep recently the news that
Facebook had shut down an AI program
that had developed its own language
captured the attention of media and just
a few months months ago we experienced a
breakthrough with a gene editing
technology CRISPR that now allows us to
repair dangerous and disease-causing
mutations prompting researching cries of
designer babies and also reminders of
the responsibilities that we have with
this newfound ability to alter the
course of evolution as Steve Jobs once
said it&#39;s an apples DNA that technology
alone is not enough it is technology
married with the liberal arts married
with the humanities that yields the
result that makes our hearts to sing and
I think his words will ring true to most
of us have any of you ever shed a tear
or two watching a movie reading a book
or listening to music I know I have in
my first experience with musical theater
watching The Phantom of the Opera and
not because I have any kind of personal
experience being tutored by a disfigured
musical genius living in underground
labyrinths but because I also understand
how it feels to be obsessed over an
impossible ideal the bhagavad-gita
originally an oral composition documents
Arjuna in his hesitation to fight and go
to war with his family I&#39;ve never met a
cousin on the battlefield with a sword
and you probably haven&#39;t either but
maybe you have experienced a moment of
religious or spiritual doubt and
Shakespeare&#39;s Macbeth is the epitome of
ambition and maybe you&#39;ve also
considered a less than ethical approach
to reaching your dreams whether you took
it or not although these characters
circumstances vary wildly from our own
their struggles reflect and amplify our
own experiences allowing us to watch
ourselves through the lens of an
a 19th century French writer standing in
front of this work of art once told us
that he felt the celestial sensations
encountering the impassioned sentiments
that experience is now known as the
Stendhal syndrome the fact that we even
have a name
for this collection of crazy symptoms
which can range from lightheadedness to
heart palpitations is proof enough of
the universal nature of these
experiences it&#39;s our moment to reach
across eras among belief systems and
throughout world&#39;s to eventually connect
us to our own humanity thank you
