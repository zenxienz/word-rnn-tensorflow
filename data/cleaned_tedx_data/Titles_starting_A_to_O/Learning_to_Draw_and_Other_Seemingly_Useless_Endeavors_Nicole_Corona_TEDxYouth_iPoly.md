good evening everyone I&#39;d like to pose a
question how many of you tell yourselves
or tell others that something is
impossible getting a child to clean up
the room impossible
becoming a doctor lawyer president
impossible spending the summer in Boston
when you have never really been outside
of your city impossible these are the
things we tell ourselves but are they
really impossible I say they&#39;re scary
and inconceivable but I say they are
possible I suggest that for many of the
things we tell ourselves that are
impossible it is not that we cannot
attain them but rather we lack
self-confidence first and foremost we
cannot equate self-confidence with
self-esteem there are two entirely
different things
that provide two entirely different
outcomes for an example let&#39;s take self
away from confidence and esteem if we
were to look up steam in the dictionary
which apparently I have it means
admiration its self esteem is South bed
myrrh Asian what exactly would I be a
miring about myself well honestly it&#39;d
be the reason why I&#39;m here today as one
looks of confidence you see that it
speaks more closely to assurances based
on one&#39;s ability
let&#39;s take Steve Jobs for an example
Steve Jobs today is known for his
technology of the iPhone but what are
his insurances and it&#39;s basically his
confidence without his confidence he
would have never become the person that
we remember of him without confidence
Apple would have never made would have
never been possible without confidence
where would he have started his path I
suggest that for many of the things I
suggest up for many of things we tell
ourselves in order to conquer the
impossible we must first build upon
self-confidence to achieve the smallest
goals and get their lives Daley&#39;s duties
and responsibilities we must have a
certain type of confidence well how do
we get confidence first let&#39;s stop for a
moment and ask ourselves that question
and then let&#39;s rephrase our word into
how do we lose our confidence now we
start to get flashed back a lot of
memory starts to come in a short brief
answers most most of us in our lives
that has have had a moment of
insecurities right now how many of you
have been insecure in your life when was
the last time you were insecure or let&#39;s
take today as the event how many of you
were running a bit late to the event
trying to find parking because you were
just focused on getting here on time
those are insecurities we really don&#39;t
think about the importance of obtaining
confidence is mainly to push and pull
through the different voices and
opinions that tell us yes No
may we do this and do that relying on
those negative comments and especially
on the people tend to take our
individuality away from us especially
making us feel unsure about ourselves
society today is driven by other
standpoints we all have common labels
where we team tend to engage our entire
behavior especially our own lives we&#39;re
all we all know some of these particular
labels however not all of them next
slide looks like some of these level
labels can be positive such as being the
teacher&#39;s pet next slide or being the a
student and some others can be negative
next slide go go okay one of them can be
people thinking oh I&#39;m too ugly oh I&#39;m
too fat not good enough not attractive
my acne girls who have long hair and
she&#39;s that are straight wanting curly
hair vice versa next slide and most
importantly our personality so how do I
get how do I get rid of these
insecurities and become more self
dependent upon myself well the only
strength we have in ourselves in the
defense against the world is our cm
enough we don&#39;t need any of the
things to become confident of ourselves
especially all those negative comments
that come to us none of these things
matter it doesn&#39;t matter what our
physical appearance is it doesn&#39;t matter
what others tell us who we should become
what really matters as a we become the
person we believe we are most secure
about without those little imperfections
of insecurities we wouldn&#39;t define the
person that we stand to be here today
most importantly the insecurity is
define the stamina that we have within
us in school I might look like a perfect
girl with her perfect life that gets
things done easily honestly I have my
own insecurities too and personally I
know confidence is hard to come by two
years ago I used to be the shy nervous
girl who couldn&#39;t take a risk because
she was too focused on what the outcome
would be but now I&#39;m not that girl
anymore I actually had this summer had
the experience to go and take on upon an
internship at best of Boston at Babson
College and for those who don&#39;t know
buss Babson College it&#39;s one of the
world&#39;s or nation&#39;s number what top
school for business most focused on
entrepreneurship skills as life has
passed by I have started to peel off
that turtle that little turtle shell up
on my back with it I would have never
become the person I stand to be to here
today nor would I be talking today but
along the way I have had my family
school faculty and best friend who have
perpetually stood by my side telling me
Nicole you can do anything in life as
long as you live to your fullest give it
the best you can and never give up
easily next slide next slide next slide
we should rely upon people that make us
happy not that don&#39;t care about us not
that leave us hanging on the side and
especially don&#39;t ask us to change any
aspect of our lives just to please them
our deepest fear is not that we are
inadequate of ourselves our deepest fear
is that we are powerful beyond our reach
it is our light not our
darkness that frightens us the most as
the saying goes in order to gain
confidence
one must fake it fake it till you make
it or what&#39;s the reason for the
possibility in the impossible thank you
[Applause]
