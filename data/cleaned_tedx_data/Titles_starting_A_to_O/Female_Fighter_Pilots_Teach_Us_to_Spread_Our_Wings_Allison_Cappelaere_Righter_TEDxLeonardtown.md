do you know you have wings we all do and
there&#39;s a great quote that says until
you learn to spread your wings you&#39;ll
have no idea how far you can fly now I
was never a big fan of metaphors until
this one of wings and flying really
stuck with me and it started on March 11
2013
when I lost my big sister this is her
pictured here Navy lieutenant Valerii
capillary Delaney vowel is most called
her made the ultimate sacrifice at the
age of 26 years old when the Navy
fighter jet she was piloting crashed
during a low-level flight mission in
eastern Washington State now I am NOT a
pilot and I&#39;m not in the military but I
looked up to my big sister my whole life
we were two years apart that was the
typical rebellious middle child of three
girls and we were really close now don&#39;t
be too fooled by that pretty face here
because let me tell you val was tough I
watched from ground level of course
Val&#39;s journey towards the sky as she
achieved her dream of becoming a Navy
fighter pilot something that still not
many women do as her younger sister I
looked up to her and I admired her for
so many things but three things
specifically stand out to me how she
fearlessly reached forward for role
models and mentors how she selflessly
reached behind to support and encourage
others and how she relentlessly
persevered through adversity using her
favorite motto adapt and overcome
no hear more about those later but the
true testament of Val&#39;s lasting legacy
became evident by a collection of wings
from female aviators around the world
I&#39;m going to share with you the story of
these wings and I want for us
imagine what they represent individually
and collectively and metaphorically
using examples from Val&#39;s life and from
within the female aviation community my
hope is that we can all learn to spread
our own wings and to let our dreams take
flight
every pilot remembers the day they earn
their coveted aviator wings these small
uniform tokens represent the enormous
effort and sacrifice necessary to
complete the rigorous training required
to become a military aviator Val earned
her wings of gold in February of 2012
and then she traded them in for her
angel&#39;s wings just a year later right
before her funeral a few of her friends
came together with this idea to give
their aviator pins as a symbol of their
presence what started as a simple
Facebook message transformed overnight
into a message thread of several hundred
female aviators around the world who
started sending in their wings from all
ranks and branches within the military
from complete strangers these wings just
started flying in each neatly wrapped
and with personal notes and well may it
may theoretically be easy for these
women to replace their uniform pins it&#39;s
impossible for us to replace the meaning
behind these small tokens which we could
physically see in some of the wings that
were clearly well worn some were made of
14-karat gold and some had engravings on
the back at her funeral our family was
presented with two long jump straps full
of nearly 200 sets of wings in a letter
her friends who had coordinated this
explained how as a minority and as the
youngest generation of junior officers
they understand that their success
depends on the
support they give each other they know
that they have to reach forward for role
models and mentors and also reach back
to support and encourage others coming
behind them and they felt like Val
embodied that more than anyone and they
explained how individually these wings
represent amazing personal
accomplishment and together they
celebrate the strength of all female
aviators this completely blew us away
even the women who started this were
just as shocked as we were with how
organically this all evolved to me it
was just so overwhelming to see how one
death sparked one idea of one selfless
action that was then replicated and
magnified within an entire community to
produce such a powerful and symbolic
result these wings are on display at the
women&#39;s memorial Arlington National
Cemetery as part of a wings for Val
exhibit and more wings get out of each
year it&#39;s absolutely incredible if you
ever get the chance to check it out in
experiencing this whole phenomenon it
really motivated my family and me to
create the wings for Val foundation so
that we could honor my sister&#39;s legacy
by continuing this cycle of support for
women in aviation
so far we&#39;ve given out four scholarships
to help offset the financial burden of
private flight training for promising
young women earning their pilots wings
and it&#39;s been amazing but beyond just
supporting women in aviation I want to
be able to use my sister&#39;s story to
support and inspire and empower future
generations of female leaders in any
field in the same way that I&#39;ve been
inspired in my own field of public
health and nutrition which has nothing
to do with aviation so I want to go back
and I want to revisit those three
characteristics that Val embodied and
that are exemplified within the female
aviation community that I believe can
apply to all of us as we dare to soar to
great heights so the first is to reach
forward and using that flank flight
lingo fly high on the wings of your
heroes fowl dreamed big throughout her
childhood and she always took the most
challenging route ultimately deciding in
high school shortly after 9/11 to follow
in the footsteps of our grandfather and
great-uncle who served in the military
and his pilot&#39;s at each juncture within
the Naval Academy and at flight school
Bell never hesitated to reach out to
women ahead of her for support and
guidance as she navigated difficult
decisions and the unique day-to-day
challenges of being one of very few
females in military aviation Val risked
it all for the opportunity to fly and to
serve our country and she always
acknowledged the women ahead of her who
first made it possible for her to be
able to do so and it&#39;s interesting that
for women in American military aviation
this dates back really as far back as
well one but especially immoral - with
the women Air Force Service Pilots the
wasp who first blazed the trail but also
fought for decades to get the
appropriate recognition and benefits as
veterans it really wasn&#39;t until the
1970s that the military officially
opened flight training for women but
their flying was limited to non-combat
missions and that didn&#39;t change until
1993 so it really hasn&#39;t been that long
and still to this day the Navy reports
that less than 9% of all aviators are
women so I think what we can learn here
from from Val and from these female
aviator
is that takes a lot of courage to set a
lofty goal to stretch outside of our
comfort zone
to ask for help but also be fearless in
blazing our own trail because at the end
of the day no one&#39;s going to do the work
for you so I want you to think about how
you can fly forward on the wings of your
heroes how can you reach ahead to find
inspiration and role models and mentors
to help you achieve your big goals so as
your your you&#39;re learning to spread your
wings and your soaring along your own
unique flight path there will be
opportunities to use your wings and so
the second key point here is to reach
behind and use your wings to help others
Val had the opportunity to deliver a
sermon to a church she belonged to in
Texas in 2010 and she told the
congregation we&#39;ve all been given
special gifts that are meant to be
shared I try to remind myself often that
it&#39;s not about me and when I do feel my
life becoming larger that the
possibilities are endless
val chose a life of service to our
country but she also served her friends
and family on a daily basis especially
through her phone calls and handwritten
letters and care packages when she
played Division one La Crosse at the
Naval Academy I can tell you she was
nowhere near the best player on that
team but she enthusiastically supported
her teammates and served as the heart of
her team even from the bench in the same
way that the female aviators ahead of
Val had reached back to support and
encourage her throughout her flight
training process Val always looked for
opportunities to take her classmates and
teammates under her wings to support and
encourage them and I think this is
really the kind of support system that
these female aviators rely on to survive
and to succeed within their challenging
field so how are you currently using
your wings to help others and what more
can you do to reach behind to help
support and inspire someone else coming
behind you you know this is definitely
an ongoing process with this underlying
tension I think between being fearless
in pursuit of your own wings while at
the same time also being selfless in
helping someone else find their wings
and we need to be able to do both
finally we have to be prepared to face
adversity in our lives and so the motto
I want you to remember here is adapt and
overcome
Val picked up this motto during a summer
training program with the Marines in
2009 and I was the first in our family
to experience Val&#39;s obsession with her
newly-found motto when we took a sister
spring break trip together down to the
Grand Canyon at the start of our trek
all the way down to the bottom and back
up the next day that val had planned I
started fumbling with my Camelback water
backpack and I couldn&#39;t get the
mouthpiece to work and I&#39;m like fretting
that I&#39;m not gonna be able to have water
during her whole trip down there and Val
was getting so impatient and just barked
at me
le adapt and overcome let&#39;s go and then
she continued to say this phrase
me probably 17 more times over the next
24 hours any time I would complain or
something would go wrong I wanted to
push her off the side of the canyon at
times but we made it through and her
motto definitely stuck so much so that
in a book put together at my Bridal
luncheon filled with thoughtful marriage
advice what do you think pal wrote Aly
adapt and overcome
love Val talk about good marriage advice
so I think that this motto and this
mentality really allowed vow to
persevere through some really
challenging obstacles in pursuit of her
dream to fly as a kid she was teased for
being overweight and wearing glasses she
didn&#39;t actually get into the Naval
Academy the first year she applied and
had to attend of your prep school and
once she was in flight school she
actually had to get corrective eye
surgery before she qualified for flight
training and then even once she became a
pilot she battled to prove herself every
day based on merit and not on gender she
could have given up at any point but
instead she persisted and grew stronger
in the face of these setbacks ultimately
becoming the rock within our family as
our mom suffered through a breast cancer
diagnosis and her older sister lost her
first baby to genetic disease at eight
months old Val sometimes made it look
easy but her journey was anything but
and I&#39;m realizing it&#39;s the same for all
these women aviators who demonstrate how
resiliency is critical to success and
then I&#39;m also up here saying you don&#39;t
have to be a fighter pilot to face and
overcome adversity in your life so think
about the hardships that you&#39;re facing
and how might you be able to apply this
adapt and overcome mentality to rise
above the challenges that life&#39;s going
to put in your path and keep moving
forward towards achieving your dreams
and and finding your purpose when the
female aviators presented their wings to
our family they closed their
letter by saying we leave our wings with
Val and we carry her with us in the sky
I know that my sister&#39;s spirit continues
to soar high within the aviation
community and in the lives of all those
her story has touched through the wings
for Val Foundation - my family seeing
big bees in the sky made by airplane
contrails or migrating birds is our
visible reminder that val is always with
us guiding and inspiring our lives in
our work it&#39;s all started to click for
me recently that it&#39;s no coincidence
that birds fly in a V formation when
they migrate scientists have shown that
being connected in this pattern helps
give the birds the extra lift and energy
needed to make it to their destination
they have to synchronize the timing to
get this whole phenomenon right and they
even take turns of who&#39;s the lead bird
in that formation could our collection
of the 200 wings for Val be an example
of how the female aviation community was
working in a v-formation to bring extra
lift and energy to each of its
individual members I gave you instances
of how my sister reached forward reached
behind and adapted and overcame but each
one of those sets of wings represents
another woman with her own unique story
for how she&#39;s also reached forward
reached behind and adapted and overcame
when brought together in formation the
collective strength and impact of that
community is far greater than the sum of
those individual women and their stories
how could we come together with others
to produce the same result in our own
communities our homes our workplaces
told you at the beginning house never
really big fan of metaphors but can you
now
see why I just couldn&#39;t let this one go
I I live it and I breathe it every day
and I hope that you&#39;re able to find some
special meaning in it for your life as
well building off of that quote I
mentioned at the at the start I am now
convinced that when we have the courage
to spread our wings and to use them to
help others just like those birds and
the female pilots we can fly further
together than we ever could on our own
thank you
