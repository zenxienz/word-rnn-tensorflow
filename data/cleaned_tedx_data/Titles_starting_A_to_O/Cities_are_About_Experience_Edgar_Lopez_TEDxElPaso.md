hi everybody I&#39;m editor Lopez through a
lifetime of experience and observations
I realize that cities are all of our
experience many times having asked why
do you become an architect and the most
easy and obvious answer is because I
love design and I love designing so many
aspects in so many fields having
exploring landscaping and tears or then
pottery surely graphic design but
highways come back to architectural
design and why is that because I believe
architectural design can change sleepy
people&#39;s lives it can change people&#39;s
perspective where they live and not only
the people who are using the building
but the people who experience the
building and as passerby they are so
it&#39;s so cool to be an architect because
you walk into your city and you see a
building and you know that you are part
of the reason why that building is there
designs can change lives
I remember back growing up in Paris in
walking into this little pink building
the main post office welcomed with my
mom and in being many mesmerized by the
architecture by the noise of that
building inside by the proportion by the
style by the people walking in
exceptional impact on me but later on I
realized that it was not the building
who made that in Peckham it was coming a
few blocks from the bus stop and
experience the city and experience that
energy that the city give you the street
vendors are people walking the cars the
air the wind the Sun everything in
conjunction is such a big energy that&#39;s
why I was mesmerized by this building
now growing a little bit older and being
more responsible page
ten living in Los Krypton quarries I was
escaping my house and taking the bus to
go and BC the buildings that I love just
like what is racetrack mid-century
modern beautiful building beautiful
people it was just to see that building
and the energy was inside it was inside
it was keeping me be coming back but
also that movie theatres in downtown
like the Cena Plaza beautiful
architecture inspiring lobbies with
murals and sculptures and lighting but I
realized that&#39;s not what I like it what
I like it is to walk into my city and
experience it and live and leave it and
I said to myself you know one day you&#39;re
gonna be an architect and the only thing
that you have to be successful
it&#39;s do a good design but no it&#39;s not
enough because design is not visual it&#39;s
more than that it&#39;s an experience and
probably my designs won&#39;t change the
world but then the government makes it
look much better looking and to
understand all this idea that I&#39;m trying
to express is the way that we experience
other cities around the world is
different the world of the way you
experience our city because most of the
time we drive in other cities whisperin
said walking or mass transit and nothing
we realize how amazing is this city some
cities they are great by itself some
cities are in being reinventing
themselves and there are so many ways to
do that let&#39;s talk about Bilbao be well
just with a simple signature piece of
architecture reinvent yourself
there truism industrial and now it&#39;s a
global city but was not the first ones
to do that remember Sydney Sydney was
leading the way with that piece of
architecture that is the opera singing
opera house who doesn&#39;t recognize that
who knew about Kuala Lumpur KL was
nobody until they had the Petronas and I
was a well recognized City but he&#39;s not
only that is the way you live on that
City the pedestrian level the quality of
life other ways to reinvent ourselves is
rebranding rebranding creating logos and
campaigns to the city or to thus to this
or to the region or to the country and
one of the backs is an example is I Love
New York who doesn&#39;t remember who
doesn&#39;t recognize his logo but New Yor
launched this campaign after the 80s
when they were fighting the crime on the
city and he&#39;s been so successful and
it&#39;s still relevant I answer them
is the one most recent campaigns for a
city that has been copying copies so
many times a matter of fact Claude is
just across the border had this campaign
and it&#39;s been so successful in popular
that a vehicle by everybody go and take
selfies there even stores selling
memorabilia but a campaign to work has
to be in conjunction between the public
and the private sector they cannot do
about their self or we cannot do it by
ourselves we have to be a campaign the
last many years in order to be a
successful
other cities they&#39;re been reinventing
the way they grow just like New York it
was the creator of the ordinance
zoning ordinance that&#39;s why the shape of
those old high-rises that have a step
shape but those zonings they&#39;ve been
evolving yeah like the city because the
city is a living entity they&#39;ve been
changing the zoning adapting to the
times to the times just like Portland
for 20 right there codes to become a
greener City now Porton attracts so much
attention so much talent especially from
the younger generations but there is
also bad series series a big bet
everything to vehicle series that we
have here in our back yard just like
Houston or Dallas that is still doing
great efforts to make it better to make
a more livable and walkable
other cities like Dubai an amazing city
global city with outstanding
architecture but when you go there there
is something missing is missing the soul
of the city it&#39;s hard to walk it&#39;s hard
to travel if it&#39;s nothing in a bus on a
metro or in a taxi there is no public
spaces where you can meet probably the
only public spaces you see are the malls
and that&#39;s not right
another example in just one country we
have two great samples Apollo and
Brasilia Sapolu overpopulated with
traffic problems communication problems
this city is easy to travel from one
place to another on helicopter now
Brasilia on the other hand created from
scratch an ideal ship an ideal city from
the Corbusier ideas but is missing the
point because the Brazilian is such a
vibrant culture that is kind of sterile
for them remember design is an
opportunity for impact
probably the Corbusier and many others
like Costa means the point here but I
have a solution for them I know a great
urban planner coming back to our region
our amazing region we need to capture
that new generation generation the
Millennials Millennials are gonna move
to a city if they have a better quality
of life if they can work live and play
close by where they don&#39;t have to own a
car we don&#39;t have to own a house we have
the best region
I remember this phrase from Maria fell
is this Mexican actress who say once
lava yessuh a la clase and Piazza de las
planta de tus PS es como de paris como
Caminos stuarti truth the beauty in the
class start with the footer where the
sole of your feet is the way you spend
the way you walk the way you carry
yourself is a matter of attitude and we
have all that is on our foundation it&#39;s
an hour
people in our class in our values we
have all we are a region who&#39;s been
living in harmony for so many years we
have history we have the best climate
the best sunsets the best food let&#39;s not
talk about the amazing catalog of
buildings that we have in downtown
probably the best thing that ever
happened to a plateau there in doorman
for a few years and now we have this
opportunity and responsibility to do
something with them but let&#39;s not forget
those buildings that were not there
before there were smaller smaller
buildings probably they&#39;re gonna be a
bigger buildings on top of them let&#39;s
not be afraid of our future and we
invent the market internals burritos
what else oh we want what happened to us
on the 17th we have this great idea
entries this gradation between two
cities basically was communication and
communication between two cities two
countries two cultures they have this
monorail in between because I believe
communication is everything we need to
build more bridges no walls can we
retake this idea back I don&#39;t know is
possible after 9/11 but communication is
everything let&#39;s communicate our city
better why do we have el paso metro this
will be great it doesn&#39;t have to be a
subway it can be a light rail a mass
transit a Rapid Transit System
you name it once we start waters will
follow
remember when El Paso sneezes or is
catch a cold
so everything affect each other I&#39;m
always been mesmerizing else learning
what was hill Camino reality beyond
event row is this amazing role created
by Don Juan de Onate
from Mexico City to Santa Fe that&#39;s why
you Mexico his name&#39;s New Mexico he was
this crossroads opening routes for
people and goods from one point to
another can we and in between creating
this amazing series Chihuahua and
torre√≥n
and Zacatecas in Quetta in Albuquerque
and then we&#39;re in the middle of them
we&#39;re on the crossroads where El Paso
del Norte El Paso the Paso for the
world&#39;s will speak Spanish okay we&#39;re in
stake that and do a Hyperloop or a speed
train like many other countries has and
then recreate our our region it can be
also fantastic to have that energy
economic energy but this come back to
our city a few series that have the
opportunity to have them in the middle
of the heart a piece of land and it
means
underutilize can we create a millennial
Park a Central Park can we revalued
vitalize the city with this piece of
land it&#39;s just a matter of money and put
the train underneath it&#39;s an eyesore
which other city has some mountain on
the middle there is a staying natural
National Park Hong Kong on the Victoria
Peak he has this Observatory and is one
of the most visited spots for tourists
and where you can see the city and the
city is amazing probably is half of the
size of ours but they don&#39;t have what we
have we don&#39;t have those huge sunsets
the Mason City that we had a feeling
that you cannot define where is where El
Paso ends and what is when with what is
a start there are opportunities we
architects sometimes we feel like we&#39;re
being dictated how to design because
there are so many rules and northern
insisting and acts and some of those are
obsolete and we don&#39;t know why it&#39;s
still there but if we as a city as a
community we can take just a few of
those and tailor them to make our new
neighbors more dense and the streets
narrower just with those two element of
the land of our city is being occupied
by those two that&#39;s why we love these
old neighborhoods that we have because
they are livable
they are lockable and they are mix and
this is my base advice less copy and
less copy not only other cities in your
life copy your heroes the people that
you trust but not copying them legally
copy the idea behind that copy many of
them you cannot become original they
said you copy one is plagiarism but you
copy many his research coming back to a
first feeling that I was sucking this
problem this little building inspired me
to be what I am to be an architect to
create because I prefer to be a creator
that are consumer I have the opportunity
to live and work on many cities in both
countries and also travel around the
world and now we said whatever I learn
whatever experience come back to your
hometown and make a difference because
even is that different is this big it&#39;s
gonna be a different for somebody that&#39;s
why your posture is so good
but you know what el chico it can be
better
[Applause]
