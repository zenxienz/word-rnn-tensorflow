I&#39;m here tonight to talk to you about
one of my life&#39;s great loves it&#39;s a love
that has
stetic informed my creative output and
my entire identity it began before I can
even remember I wasn&#39;t even three years
old yet in 1977 and with my dad Robert
and he like most dads in America that
year took the family to see the hottest
box-office ticket at the movies Star
Wars and one of the film&#39;s heroes
reminded me so much of my father and
still does good looking well-traveled
intelligent person okati protocol
obsessed gay perfectionist c-3po so my
love of robots began not just because I
found them fascinating but because they
were family and they were everywhere
when I was a kid
TWiki on Buck Rogers was voiced by Mel
Blanc the same man who gave me my
favorite cartoon characters Daffy Duck
and Bugs Bunny and the disco
stormtroopers the Cylons gave me my
favorite colors chrome and LED red and
made the sound of the vocoder music to
my ears
and then the best of all the robot human
hybrids the cyborgs whether they were
villains like Darth Vader or heroes like
the Six Million Dollar Man and the
Bionic Woman taught me that with
technology we could be delivered from
death but that doesn&#39;t deliver us from
evil that is in the choice of the user
is our newfound power used for harm or
for help does it
enhance our humanity or diminish it the
lessons of the sci-fi seventies segue
into the poppin and lock-in 80s where we
all started doing the robot and bringing
home our first computers or video game
consoles it was the era where women&#39;s
fashion found endless inspiration in the
repla femme fatales Rachel and Priss of
Blade Runner and where James Cameron
gave audiences their most enduring
technological nightmare in the
of the Terminator we learned new words
and new art forms that decade modem
anime and other words took on new
meaning networking cellular escape in
the 90s the word cyber entered our
consciousness the internet entered our
spaces and with advancements in
prosthetics with implants allowing deaf
children to hear the notion of Bionic
people didn&#39;t really seem that
far-fetched and that&#39;s where we find at
Clark Community College in Washington
State just across the bridge from
Portland Oregon
young on a Lynch study of popular
culture in knee deep in 70s nostalgia
with reruns of the Bionic Woman on a
constant loop and having just studied
Joseph Campbell&#39;s examination of the
hero&#39;s journey
I took his criteria and applied it to my
childhood heroine Jaime Sommers for my
first ever robotic writing project OSI
Magazine the Bible of Bionic love and
this was in the explosion of the zine
phenomenon if you&#39;re not familiar with
this uniquely 90s occurrence it&#39;s a zine
as a small self-published magazine and
it&#39;s usually some sort of something
about popular culture or some obscure
obsession of the author my zine painted
the caring and compassionate miss
Sommers as the union of opposing forces
of science and nature the literal
embodiment of the future and a herald
for the coming technological age not
just a television show no the Bionic
Woman is an Oracle teaching us that
technology is not something to be feared
but that&#39;s something if harnessed with
the best intentions can take humanity to
the next level of existence physically
mentally spiritually and it&#39;s around the
same time that mutual loves of mine love
of theater music and dress-up all
converged when I was asked to emcee and
perform in a twice weekly drag and
burlesque show in Portland Oregon at the
place called the Paris theater
and for our Halloween show I decided I
was going to be a robot yeah big stretch
I know and as I was describing my
movements and my look to my friend
Michael the word animatronic escaped my
lips and as soon as it did and both
froze and looked at each other I said oh
my god
animatronic and in that moment on a
Lynch was reborn a better stronger
faster 21st century cyborg super Queen
animatronic and where do cyborgs super
Queens go Silicon Valley and that&#39;s
where in the pansexual San Francisco
cyberpunk late-1990s
I found a home and a calling amongst an
incredible group of artists and
performers who would converge every
Tuesday at an alternative drag Club
called tranny Shack and that was where I
learned how dress up glamour drag is not
just a fun way to comment on gender in
society but it can be used as a real
powerful tool for personal
transformation and self-realization the
drag Club is for many transgender people
the first public step in embodying their
true selves and tea shock provided for
me a safe space to explore my own
sexuality and gender expression and I
found that by taking an aspect of my
personality and blowing it up into
separate persona to inhabit an avatar
IRL drag helped express the multitudes
within me and by living a life of my own
creation even for a night even for five
minutes on stage I was able to create my
true self and it was in this hotbed of
inspiration that I was introduced to the
work of another science writer who
influenced me very much but not a writer
of fiction a writer who confirmed my
Bionic love and transformed it into
something so much more Donna Haraway
who is a professor and a writer of
several groundbreaking treatises on
human machine relay
told me I didn&#39;t have to wait to become
a cyborg I already am one fittingly in
the year 1984 Harraway wrote a cyborg
manifesto and in it she makes this
statement by the late 20th century our
time a mythic time we are all chimeras
theorized and fabricated hybrids of
machine and organism in short we are
cyborgs the cyborg is our ontology it
gives us our politics the cyborg is a
condensed image of both imagination and
material reality the two joined centers
structuring any possibility of
historical transformation in the
traditions of Western science and
politics the relation between organism
and machine has been a border war the
stakes in this border war have been the
territories of production reproduction
and imagination a cyborg manifesto is an
argument for the pleasure in confusion
of boundaries and for responsibility in
their creation and she goes on to write
that her manifesto is written in the
utopian tradition of imagining a world
without gender which is perhaps a world
without Genesis but maybe also a world
without end and right there in academia
that at the end at the dawn of the 21st
century I found in theory ideas that
felt like the science fiction I grew up
reading I got confirmation in the idea
that with technology we can push back
against the rigid boundaries imposed
upon us that we can take an active part
in our own evolution and augment our the
evolution of our bodies of our minds and
take humanity to the next level of
existence Donna Haraway blew open a door
to a path that led me to the
most exciting word I know transhuman and
transhumanism is where all my paths
intersect where my love of robots and
cyborgs drag queens and and Regine&#39;s
tekken sci-fi fantasy and reality come
together in one massive boundary
shattering field of study it&#39;s where
bionic people become real and is the one
word that best sums up both my faith in
the future and my belief in human
potential
it&#39;s where the science fiction of
William Gibson becomes realized in the
work of Martine Rothblatt and Randall
Cooney who may be the people who allow
us to upload our minds onto digital
brain emulation software and have our
consciousness live on long after our
physical bodies give out okay this isn&#39;t
an episode of black mirror it&#39;s real I
mean it is also an episode of black
mirror but it&#39;s also real and that&#39;s
what separates robots and artificial
intelligence apart from all other
aspects of science fiction storytelling
robots are here artificial intelligence
is on this planet and it we are
interacting with it on a daily basis and
that is only going to continue to grow a
robot was just made a citizen in Saudi
Arabia it was a gimmick but it&#39;s really
happening
robots confuse the boundaries between
life and death
male and female master and servant
thinking and perceiving male and female
ability and disability I take pleasure
in the confusion of all of these
boundaries and as an artist I have a
unique platform to study and share these
stories and as a transhumanist I take
responsibility in their examination and
the formation of new boundaries
boundaries that expand and challenge the
very definition of personhood now
Martine Rothblatt who is working on this
brain emulation software says that if
you believe in transgender rights it&#39;s
really not that far leap to become a
transhumanist at all in one of her
groundbreaking treatises
she writes that freedom of gender is a
gateway to a freedom of form and to an
explosion of human potential if you can
accept that a person without a penis can
peaceably live life as they please
including is a man then you should be
able to accept that a person without
physical form can peaceably live life as
they please
including as a human can you accept that
someone is not automatically passive or
evil or done simply because they have a
vagina instead of a penis then you
should be able to accept that a person
without physical form or a person is not
automatically passive or evil or dumb
simply because they have a
software-based mind instead of a flesh
based one mind is the substance of
humanity mind is deeper than matter she
goes on to write that human identity is
limitless and variety and detachable
from reproduction personhood is about
equity not equipment and these are the
ideas that we&#39;re throwing around state
this is the world we live in and it&#39;s
only going to continue and when we are
confronted with artificial intelligence
that thinks we need to know where we
stand we have accept we need to examine
the spaces that robots occupy in our
storytelling before they start occupying
spaces in our society we are on the
verge of creating a new kind of
intellectual equity a new kind of person
and we have an opportunity and an
imperative I believe in this moment to
be prepared because once robot rights do
become a rallying cry and they are no
longer storylines from the matrix or
Futurama we will be forced to look
around and examine just how well we&#39;ve
done with the rights of our fellow
humans have we been using our time or
technology our talents to build bridges
or walls the coming AI revolution
provides an imperative for us to address
the inequalities that exist on this
planet and to allow us as we become more
Bionic to actually become more human
