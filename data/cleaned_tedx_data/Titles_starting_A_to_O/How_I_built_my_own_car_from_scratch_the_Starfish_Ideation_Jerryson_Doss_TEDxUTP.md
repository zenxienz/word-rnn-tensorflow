my name is Jerry Santos and you know I
am called a social entrepreneur an
entrepreneur a CEO a philanthropist and
I&#39;m termed as being successful but the
truth is it is so different from what I
have gone through and I would like to
share what launched me forward because
currently we educate underprivileged
children I have an orphanage I have a
shelter for abandoned youths a shelter
for mothers who are single we take them
off the streets and we educate the
children and provide them jobs and the
people that work in my factory are
ex-addicts graduates from rehab center
the homeless and a lot more I&#39;m also
involved in providing livelihood to the
refugee community as part of the
initiative as well as I have a day job
which I have a company in oil and gas
but let me share with you I actually
come from a fishing village called
chucai c&#39;mon now the direct translation
for the word
choukai I&#39;m sure you know in the local
dialect is Texas right now if you think
that is because it&#39;s a free port and you
don&#39;t have to pay taxes well it&#39;s not
true because what really happened and
how it got his name and I&#39;m not lying to
you
someone falls in the river at the
beginning of every year and gets eaten
up by this beast it&#39;s a crocodile but I
call it the Beast rucksack saw and human
became text to the crocodile that
eventually led towards the name Texas
choukai now what was also different
about the town that I prop is there was
a different type of beasts and this
beasts gobbled up dreams the Society was
such that they believe that when you
grow up and if you have all these ideas
of success and trying to achieve big
things something is not right you&#39;re
gonna get really disappointed don&#39;t
dream too big I can still remember the
first time and I was told to write an
essay of my dream house
this is back in 1983 and I indicated
that my dream house the whole entire
house will have air conditioning and a
swimming pool that si was flung to my
face and he said don&#39;t build castles in
the air and it was just a society that
whenever you tell that you know I want
to do great things no great things are
for people in Kuala Lumpur the city we
are just village people we&#39;re gonna live
here we&#39;re gonna grow up here and you&#39;re
gonna come back here right so don&#39;t
dream too big you&#39;ll be disappointed and
I kept on believing because one of the
biggest person that was closest to my
heart was my mom but she was always
afraid that I would be disappointed when
I don&#39;t achieve my dreams she was always
very protective so it changed and you&#39;d
be surprised one day I went to this
night market and there was this toy
store and this is 1983 fishing village I
saw this car toy it was a sports car it
was red in color and his doors went up
now I have not seen that ever a car red
sports car those went up and I told my
dad you&#39;ve got to get this toy sports
car you got to get it and it was this
toy sports car and I took it to school
and I showed all my friends check out
this kind of course to them it was quite
foreign because no one has seen it and
we only had like two channels back then
so and no magazines to know what a
Lamborghini Countach or even this toy
was and everyone was so drawn that I
decided you know what we&#39;re gonna build
a sports car so I&#39;m at ten years old
telling everyone we&#39;re gonna build a
sports car so how you know for children
how to build a sports car get some you
know firecrackers and moon rockets strap
it onto a car and probably a lift up and
we needed funding so everyone started
giving their pocket loans to this little
Club of mine to build a sports car in
fact I almost detach my dad&#39;s Mazda 3 to
tree thinking that you know we just put
a hinge so that the doors would go up so
that was my journey to becoming an
entrepreneur because I was able to
influence them to believe in my dream to
build a sports car
and it&#39;s supposed to fly right so how do
we make it fly but you know in this
society the beasts always reveal itself
because then we realize that children
are not having their breakfast in school
and the parents came to know that
jerison was exporting I need to call it
funding but he call it extortion
so my little Club was shut down the
principal came to know about it and my
parents were called to the school
because I was extorting everyone for
their pocket money so one of the things
my mom asked why did you do that is
because I wanted a build a sports car
this toy sports car I just have all
these dreams of being great one day and
I&#39;m driving in this kind it&#39;s gonna fly
and this was her exact words for me
because in the indian community there&#39;s
only four jobs that are important you
know it&#39;s called the ideal job which is
doctor I can see you&#39;re laughing from
the Indians second is engineering and
geniune third is accountancy and if you
can talk a lot l lawyer okay so if you
become a doctor it&#39;s funny that in
choukai command displays all the Indian
doctors drove a Volvo all the male
doctors drove a BMW and all the Chinese
doctors they drove a Mercedes so if you
study hard and become a doctor you will
drive a Volvo but I didn&#39;t want to drive
a Volvo I wanted to make my own sports
car and this is when the beasts really
hit me hard the one that destroyed my
dreams awesome in my school they were
bullies now I was not a victim of bully
because I&#39;ve always fought back and
going low trouble but one day there was
this one particular bully nudged me and
from my bag the toy car fell out and
this is the toy carrot all my friends
were working hard to build one day and I
thought he was going to take it but what
he did was he stomped on it and it
crushed and for the first time in life I
was froze I was so shocked that I
couldn&#39;t pick myself because it felt at
that moment that everything that
everyone was saying about
not meant for big things this is a dream
you&#39;re not going to be able to achieve
this just came flooding true and I was
crushed and from that time onwards I
believed that I am going to grow up in
this village now fast forward about
twenty-one somehow another we ended up
coming to kuala lumpur for me to finish
my tertiary education now imagine this i
am becoming an accountant because out of
the three top three I&#39;m at a third level
accountancy and I was doing something
and I&#39;ve got no acting against any
accountants here but I just didn&#39;t enjoy
doing it I was just running the red race
I had a you know go I go to college I
just felt it what am i doing I&#39;m not
even enjoying what I&#39;m doing and I
decided to just follow and because I was
respectful to my mom wanted me to be an
accountant I was just doing it but I
felt my life hitting a dead end and
there was no purpose and one day when I
was walking to the college and I
realized there was something in a
display in a toy shop that was calling
me to come and look over and as I was
crossing the street I saw something red
and when I came to it it was the very
same toy car that I lost when I was a
child and I wanted to build but you see
at that moment you know I&#39;m a grown
adult so yeah I know it&#39;s just one of
those toys I&#39;ll just buy it anyway but
when I held on to that toy and I went
into the bus all those fantasies all
those you know excitement enthusiasm
when I was a child trying to inspire all
my friends I felt it was coming back and
you know what then once upon time I
wanted to build this and everyone shut
it down I I don&#39;t know why until to the
point that I missed my bus stop the bus
had to take a huge round and I had to be
in it and come back but I told myself I
need to build this because I want that
excitement back in my life to believe
that I will do great things so I told my
friends who&#39;s doing accountancy and he
said the Beast revealed itself what do
you know about making a sports car
hitting accountancy probably my know how
to calculate
how much is gonna cause I said no I have
to build it and they&#39;re beasts kept on
saying you can&#39;t so I needed to confront
one last thing so I decided to go to my
mom I said mom I&#39;m gonna build a red
sports car those are going to go up and
it&#39;s gonna fly
and my mom&#39;s exact words were don&#39;t talk
nonsense if your relations come to know
about this they will think that
something is wrong with you what can you
just study accountancy and gonna buy
whatever car you want but this time I
was different I have changed because it
was what I needed to hear to go in this
journey of making a sports car I had to
make a sports car and I went to my
friends I said no I&#39;m gonna make the
sports car so who&#39;s in so not many
people believed in my vision back then
because I&#39;ve lost a skill of influencing
others but I had enough to buy four
wheels so I put four wheels there I took
a chair and I put it right in the middle
and I stepped on it and I started
imagining this beautiful sports car that
was growing around me not like that
because times have changed but I just
saw a beautiful sports car going now
after one year it was a disaster
it didn&#39;t even look like a sports car it
looked like a junk and you know what I
lost my money I&#39;ve lost I spent so much
on it and I was spending my time in this
garage trying to build a sports car that
didn&#39;t even look anything close to a car
and everyone was telling Jenny have you
lost your mind
you&#39;re in this garage you got no social
life and now you&#39;re stuck trying to
achieve something that you&#39;re not good
at and what&#39;s what&#39;s going on
and in that depths of depression in that
you know moment of being so upset I had
this hallucination I actually saw my
youngest self on the side and I took
that tire and I slammed it onto the
bonnet because I was so angry and I
looked at a child it was my youngest
disappointed with me because I&#39;m giving
up on his dream he imagined me growing
to be great to be building a sports car
read those goes up fantastic but now
look at me I&#39;m just doing something that
I didn&#39;t enjoy I am stuck and on that
night I decided to make a commitment
that I&#39;m not gonna do this to myself
but I just don&#39;t want to disappoint my
younger self now I was angry because why
did you have to dream something so big
that is so hard to make but I decided
I&#39;m gonna make it and I went to the
toughest time for the next three years
trying to build a sports car and ladies
and gentlemen I would like to introduce
you to the Beast that I slayed if you
notice it&#39;s red in color it&#39;s a sports
car and it&#39;s dose goes up it didn&#39;t fly
but it&#39;s flew down the highway and
probably if you flap it hard enough it
could take off but you see the D when I
built this sports car I was a different
person because can you imagine that
everyone said it can&#39;t be done from
childhood and just been engrained in my
head that I am NOT meant for great
things but wait a minute I build a
sports car you told me I couldn&#39;t do it
now I can and when the day I drove my
sports car it was not about showing off
and driving and you know being glamorous
but I felt the journey that I took to
build something there was impossible and
I sleep that Beeson me the one that told
me I couldn&#39;t do so today I want to
shout out to anyone here because there
is something that is preventing you from
achieving your dreams now it is
disguised as a loved one its disguised
as your spouse as your partner as your
friend as a family member also as
rational
thinking that it makes no sense for you
to achieve it because there are so many
other priorities in life that you need
to do and need to achieve and you cannot
be selfish to achieve that but trust me
on this then you have to go and pursue
it it could be that trip to Paris it
could be that cause that no one wants
you to do meal nursing and everyone said
no you&#39;re not meant for this taboo
someone had told you when you were a
child that you&#39;re not supposed to go
down that direction trust me you cannot
disappoint that inner self that wise in
you that that is the thing that is gonna
launch you forward I didn&#39;t stop there
because once you have sleep the beasts
nothing will stop you to achieve what
you want and everything that I did in my
life thereafter in the business in
building cars in building bikes things
that I didn&#39;t know how to do I applied
the very same principle that is you told
me I can&#39;t do it
I built a sports car and it moves so I
applied that principle and went on to
build on few cars now to add icing onto
the cake
there was one particular in I love cars
so there was a car sure that I needed to
go to see all the Ferraris and standard
specs your Lamborghinis Maseratis
because I like cars and when I was about
to enter the showroom there&#39;s one of the
officials who said oh this car has to go
inside the show I said it&#39;s not
registered for him but you know what
it&#39;s free parking so why not right so I
Drive my car into this car show and I
park my car but no one knew what God was
it was this car what car was it so
everyone started touching it and they
were taking photographs and all and the
Porsche showroom guy had to keep on
polishing it so finally there was two
cars in that entire showroom that had a
barrier paper rounded one was mine and
the other one was a Bugatti Veyron which
is worked for million US dollars and I
you know who the owner is now I am not
exaggerating but this is how he
approached me and said how come you are
taking part in this show I mean you&#39;re
not fitting the criteria I said I don&#39;t
know it was free parking and it told me
to pack it in so now why not so he said
that how much to make all of this about
fifteen thousand US dollars
oh that&#39;s all wait a minute fifteen
thousand US dollars four million u.s.
dollars same attention you see
did it win the first place no was it
sold for fourteen million dollars no did
appear in any magazines no did it appear
in a fast and furious show not yet but
you know what
I felt fourteen million dollars that day
and you can say whatever you want but I
felt fourteen million dollars and it
goes to slay the Beast we remember what
my friends were saying what makes your
sports car greater than the Ferraris and
Lamborghinis out there well I built a
car that made me feel fourteen millenia
readmission so today I want to urge you
go and achieve your dreams
but there&#39;s something holding you back
examine it look for it and find that
inner child&#39;s voice that always wanted
you to do it because today I&#39;m
considered to be successful I really
don&#39;t know the definition of being
successful but I stick on to one way to
measure it you see success is not about
being better aspiring to be better than
someone else it&#39;s about being better
than your former self as long as you can
do one thing better than you did
yesterday you are moving forward and
when you move forward after you look
back you will see what a great
achievement is been so I have slipped my
biz it&#39;s time you slay yours my name is
Jerry Santos
