this is the famous that has sang his
work he&#39;s known to capture the best
moments of the wild life he even does
portraits candids and landscapes to each
photograph is different from the other
yet they all have something in common
something that can only be seen through
the eyes of a fellow photographer what
is common among all these photographs as
the photographer and the fact that he
created these photos but is not in any
of them see as a photographer you can
never capture yourself perfectly in that
perfect moment
unless you count nowadays selfies not a
big fan though as photographers we look
at the world differently we see the
world through our lens we set up
specific settings just like a camera
when we want subject to capture we go
through frame light symmetry contrast
and every other detail no matter how
minute it might be we set our focus on
specific things and blur out the
surroundings and this particular
behavior is sometimes transferred into
our personal lives because we&#39;re so used
to focusing on subjects and blurring the
neighboring we become super aware of
details
they&#39;re usually overlooked by others a
polite or a diplomatic way of saying
that we sometimes become obsessed with
details like that one time I went to the
hospital to check on my grandfather
everyone was so worried including me but
what nobody noticed and kept bothering
me was that the bed had a frame above it
and it wasn&#39;t correctly placed it was
just a little bit to the right the right
inclination kept distracting me the
whole visit towards the end of it I got
up and decided to fix it I approached my
grandfather&#39;s bed and leaned over it
everyone including my grandfather
thought that I&#39;d intend for a hug
so I ended up in the awkward position
where I&#39;m leaning over my unwell
grandfather just to fix the frame call
it obsession call it super aware all our
really matters are
details other situations where I become
critical is when one of my friends takes
a picture of a really nice viewer is
seen but messes up something that could
have made it phenomenal again no one
really notices the mess but those who
have the eye for details sometimes being
too aware hazard consequences since what
you see cannot be unseen and trust me
there are some fine details that I wish
I had never noticed but it does come
with loads of benefits our best
advantage is knowing where our goal lies
and focusing on it just like capturing a
photograph we set up everything we need
to reach the perfect result and no
picture is perfect from the first try we
take many shots and keep repeating until
we reach the result we want and are
satisfied with looking at these
photographs you think it only took one
click to get a photo like this these
perfectly captured moments are the
result of many and multiple tries and
that&#39;s how we work in life now let&#39;s
take a look at these pictures when you
see these pictures the first thing you
notice is their happiness radiating out
of the people in them their friendship
and how they&#39;re enjoying the moment I
bet if someone was asked to caption this
they&#39;d probably see something about best
friends friendship or even squad goals
for myself however when I look at these
pictures the first thing I see or the
first thing that comes to my mind really
is who&#39;s the other friend who&#39;s that one
friend who gave up being in the picture
just so they can capture it I know the
feeling because I&#39;ve been there many
many times there is always that one
friend in the gathering who sacrifices
the joy of being inside the frame just
for the sake of others I remember
standing behind my lens trying to fit
everyone in the frame and capturing that
moment if you take a look at this photo
that I took recently it was just one of
those regular days my friends were
hanging out and I thought it was worth
capturing I like this photo its
spontaneously symmetrical suddenly I
asked myself how would it feel like to
be
usually inside the frame how would it
look like I imagined the scenario and
here&#39;s the result of such imagination if
you haven&#39;t noticed I intentionally
inserted myself in three different
possible scenarios which granted me a
visa to enter the frame I wondered what
if I was chatting with Nana Nina and
Adam about their dorm experience I
wondered what if I was sitting next to
Ziad as he introduced me to his latest
friend I wondered what if I was standing
next to Ali and Yara and contributed to
their debate about gender equality
versus equity but please disregard my
imagination forget about my inside the
frame fantasy as it does not really
matter because I will not notice myself
and neither will most of you I&#39;m part of
the blurry surroundings and was never
the subject of focus I&#39;m never in the
photos I&#39;m always behind the scenes but
I would appreciate it if the public
would save even a very little bit of
their appreciation to great photos to
attribute this to the behind-the-scenes
artist who captured such photographs
being a photographer a lot of my
memories come from behind my lens where
my friends are captured smiling and
laughing some even complaining that they
didn&#39;t get the perfect angle when I
myself I&#39;m not included at all looking
back at those memories you&#39;d remember
all the fun you had and those who are
surrounding you
I remember that one time and my sister&#39;s
wedding when I first got the experience
not being behind my lens true once I was
at the receiving end of it I was doing
laughing and posing instead of
calculating frames and symmetry
I enjoyed this feeling bringing the
photography if I may say not simply the
photographer however looking back at
those photos later I was not pleased
about the details that should not have
been included about the light the
symmetry the angle the whole list even
when I want to be inside the frame I
can&#39;t help but be thinking what is
happening outside of it and that&#39;s okay
it&#39;s okay if a few details are not to my
liking as long as I got to be captured
enjoy
some happy moments with those dear to me
it&#39;s also okay if I didn&#39;t get to be
part of a really nice group photo after
all my style my perception of the small
little thing the angle and light I try
to capture are already a reflection of
myself I&#39;m already in the photo even if
not everyone can see it
once again those who have the eye for
details and are familiar with my lens
will know who pressed the button and
froze a moment in time thank you
