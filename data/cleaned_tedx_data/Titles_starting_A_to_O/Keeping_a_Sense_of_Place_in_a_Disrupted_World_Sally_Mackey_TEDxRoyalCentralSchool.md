so how is your place the chair you&#39;re
sitting in is your place albeit
temporarily you inhabit it you&#39;ve
performed it you&#39;ve come into the
theatre you&#39;ve selected the seat you&#39;ve
perhaps put a bag or papers down in a
certain position you can shuffle in it
whenever you want to it&#39;s temporarily
yours you&#39;re comfortable and the actions
you undertake and have making it yours
three weeks ago I was up at the
Edinburgh Festival sitting in the
pleasant courtyard having drinks with
friends very comfortable
it was very familiar one of my places
that same weekend was the start of the
UK football season and hundreds of
thousands of fans returned to their
stadium their place probably more their
place if their team won obviously also
that weekend a friend of mine went to
her allotment she took her two young
daughters
it&#39;s the place of history and
contentment for her it&#39;s her place but
for everybody who is comfortable in
their place there is someone whose place
is disrupted maybe even torn apart this
photo is a replaced project in Oldham
near Manchester in the UK most of the
people in the photo are migrants Oldham
was once the largest mill town in the
world it had a long history of welcoming
migrants this is another place project
in London with adults who are in care
24/7 supported living relatively new to
the location
I&#39;ll return to these later concepts of
place and belonging are difficult for
the people in these projects feeling a
sense of place feeling a sense of
belonging doesn&#39;t happen as easily for
them
it does for most of us I suspect and
because of major changes globally there
are going to be less people who feel
comfort in place but we can do something
about that
we can help people feel comfortable in
place and that&#39;s what this talk is about
what is place how can we build place
such an attachment and how can
performing places help us make place
when I&#39;m talking about place I&#39;m talking
about a physical place somewhere that&#39;s
inhabited
I mean residence location dwelling we&#39;re
connected to place its knowledge we know
it it&#39;s familiar we feel it mostly when
we talk about place it&#39;s positive not
always but usually we have the impulse
to speak with warmth or with a slight
smile about place and terms such as
place attachment and place making
proliferate UK local authorities are
bedding place into new local strategies
and they&#39;re calling on creative
activities to help place belonging it&#39;s
become important but there are problems
with place as well it&#39;s not always so
positive when we become embedded we can
be territorial excluding defensive and
then we delimit our horizons literally
and any stillness that we once sought in
place seeking that stability and
solidity that so many of us have yearned
for that stillness can turn to a sealed
inertia and then we protect sometimes
fiercely so in defending our place we
exclude others or even displace others
and we know from recent events about
such
faith in localism and protectionism
nationalist populist rhetoric that
enforces borders and erect walls as we
know so let me talk a little bit further
about what&#39;s happening now and how place
could be affected in the future
we are moving more we&#39;re moving around
the globe there&#39;s more people moving and
that&#39;s increasing there are we are told
1 million people in the air at any one
time always 1 million new Silk Roads are
being built from Shanghai to London and
Lisbon whether we are moving around the
world out of choice because we have the
wealth the power the status or whether
it&#39;s we&#39;ve been forced out of our homes
and our nation&#39;s we are moving more
we&#39;re increasing rail and road networks
and we&#39;re expanding airports since 1960
there has been a 200% increase in
migration to such an extent apparently
that if we put all migrants together in
one country not that we do that it would
be the fifth largest country in the
world some of those migrants or refugees
well actually over 20 million globally
are refugees even from the most recent
crisis Uganda is hosting a million
Syrian refugees which is more than the
whole of Europe put together and Jordan
1.2 million and it&#39;s not just political
refugees who will be on the move it&#39;s
climate refugees which potentially
climate refugees the countries in the
planetary south are struggling with the
climate injustice from the planet Earth
from the countries in the planetary
north the excess of energy use from the
north is damaging countries in the South
land
our diminishing places are disappearing
and whilst the annual growth rate of
renewables that&#39;s renewable energy
sources is increasing thank goodness
fossil fuels still it&#39;s still 80 percent
power is power 86 percent power is
powered by fossil fuels and that&#39;s
worrying so lands will diminish places
will disappear populations will move
let&#39;s take another interpretation of
movement of course we have increased
digital connectivity most of us here
could probably contact some on the other
side of the world instantly now through
cyberspace and cyberspace offers
alternative places in the ether it&#39;s not
something that I dump it&#39;s something
that some of you may have done which is
to take on an imagined avatar and to
inhabit an alternative place a fictional
place a cyber place cyber place will
certainly impact upon the way that we
think about physical places but we don&#39;t
actually know what will happen with
physical places hmm so I&#39;m going to move
off global projections and I&#39;m going to
move to the to the individual and the
personal those that would feel the lack
of place most many of us don&#39;t want to
jog through places with only fleeting
connections some do and that&#39;s fine
that&#39;s great but many of us don&#39;t want
that we want the qualities of long-term
place the ease and the belonging even if
we&#39;re only there for a short period of
time so what can be what can be done how
can we make permanent impermanent
temporary places satisfying and quickly
belonging needs to be speeded up
particularly for those who had risk or
ill --&#39;tis who need belonging more well
it&#39;s possible we can do that we can
fracture place we can accelerate place
attachment by using performance
practices we can speed up location
dwelling residents placemaking i&#39;ve been
undertaking some practical research with
colleagues and with some highly
experienced facilitators using
performance practices in community
contact contexts to do just that what we
have found is if we work with groups
subverting subverting places through
performance their feelings and response
to that place can change through
subversions or if you like performing
the unexpected they feel place more they
feel at home and attached more quickly
because they&#39;ve made or they&#39;ve joined
in making changes to those places
they&#39;ve inputted they&#39;ve shifted generic
sites into meaningful places they
performed the place they see the place
through new eyes let me give you some
examples let me talk through some
examples and show you them in a northern
town new and existing residents who are
there are tensions between cultural
groups they&#39;re prompted to review their
local streets foreign beings have landed
of course they have they&#39;ve landed and
they&#39;re there for a week and those
beings are there to have a good look
round but also they&#39;re seeking positive
energy from that area from the people
from the walls from the balloons from
the cracks in the pavement and that fuel
that positive energy which I&#39;m sure you
will recognize is going to fuel their
spacecraft which will then take them
back to their planet so residents
look at their place differently they&#39;re
looking at it through the eyes of new
strangers London youth lose their fear
of threatening places or simply review
dull everyday places differently by
playing out an art room or changing a
playground with a personal ribbon
responses to site change we have as I
said earlier we have been working with
adults in care to change to improve
their response to their localities so
they&#39;ve sprinkled sprinkles on their way
to sprinkles ice cream parlor so that
local roots feel as though they belong a
triangle of pavement is turned into an
hour-long party site for themselves and
for passers-by I can&#39;t pass that
triangle anymore without remembering
that transformation residents in a Welsh
town regret a loss of community they
identify an old close down greatly
missed a lead Oh an open-air swimming
pool as a symbol as an icon of that lost
communality so I persuade some
performers to Don some swimming costumes
that they might otherwise not have
donned and we reaper form that old site
new memories are created are added to
that community layering of place
refugees and asylum seekers as I said
earlier up in Oldham create a different
response to thoroughfares that they know
such that they can smile at those three
ways they won&#39;t forget a curious
subverted Tea Party
they make small models in the nearby
beauty spot that they&#39;ve not been to and
then they leave something of themselves
in that place so what I&#39;m saying is that
we can accelerate place attachment
through such a detailed and creative
approaches to local places with the
people who dwell there places are going
to be disrupted we know that we know
that will move or other people will move
in or it will structurally change but we
can enhance attachment by undertaking
slightly alternative bit off the wall
marginally radical participatory
performance practices performing place
increases place attachment place
attachment increases well being we can
indeed keep a sense of place in a
disrupted world thank you
