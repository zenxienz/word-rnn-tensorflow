that afternoon I&#39;m on my BMX bike I&#39;m
heading to my Wiggly Boy Scout meeting
I&#39;m riding the same route as always
through that small suburban village
where I grew up
I&#39;m 8 years at the time there was an old
mill in our village and I passed that
every week not an old one but one of
those kind of maybe 50 years old double
stored industrial Mills yellow painted
all boarded up with the windows the mill
had been abandoned for about 10 years I
was never told that the mill was a no-go
territory ah but I was always curious
about that place and one night that&#39;s
specific afternoon I roamed round back
and I realized that somebody had smashed
a window on the back so I parked my bike
I got up on the crossbar and I looked in
it was pitch dog inside I climbed
further really careful of not damaging
myself or in my Boy Scout uniform on the
scattered glass that lay around and then
I got inside the only thing illuminating
the room was the light coming from my
back I was mesmerised everything was
still there an office there was a table
chairs was a punch clock I had no idea
what that was at the point at that time
some old sacks I looked around and I
opened the door and I saw a factory line
and I looked back and I saw this table
with the cop with az√∫car hub with
traces of coffee and a thermo it was
like somebody just left the place
without looking back and everything was
covered with dust and spiderweb all the
sounds disappeared and I was there all
alone in this new world
I was Indiana Jones and I found my own
treasure five minutes later I got on my
back by a bag on my bike and I went on
the street and I went to my weekly Boy
Scout meeting and everything continued
but for some reason those few minutes
stuck with me maybe I should have lifted
at that but I didn&#39;t because as I was
growing older and growing up I never
missed a chance to go in and seek out
these places and find these places where
people leave the traces of the life that
was once living inside I assume most of
you at some point in life have passed a
mill or a house or an abandoned Factory
and I think what differs us today is
that I spent
all the effort I can to get inside and
take this house for instance because ten
years ago I decided together with one of
my old friends because we were sharing
these experiences and we talked about
him and we decided to bring our cameras
because we knew that all the places that
we had gone through to through our life
was now vanished but what what would it
be like on the inside what is it like a
house with everything is still there the
plateaus on the wall the old TV set the
furnitures the cozy corner
walk around and nobody&#39;s there people
have gone the places have been left
abandoned only for me to come and
experience these places so you walk
around this place and take it in read
the signs see the icons understand what
was this like who lived there because
everything inside these places had a
meaning and it was placed for a purpose
the cosy corner on the other side you
could basically see in the cushioning
that where people said just like they
got up and walked out except for the
fact that this was there for more than
15 years go to the kitchen you go
upstairs you see the beds you walk out
of the yard and you all this a tiny
garage opening the door finding another
treasure that just sits there and wait
to be discovered when we started this
journey we became obsessed with the
questions the questions of why why
doesn&#39;t anybody care why is it all just
left behind we&#39;re the owners why haven&#39;t
anybody done anything what about all the
valuables and very often it was actually
the lack of answers that kept us coming
back coming back for more because we
were puzzled we didn&#39;t realize the
existence of this of these places and
sometimes there&#39;s a really really
strange feeling once you&#39;re inside an
abandoned place because you can get
really close to the people even though
there are no people and I&#39;m gonna tell
you we don&#39;t want to meet people
not in these places but once you&#39;re
inside you kind of slowly figure out
what kind of life was living who were
the people you slowly gather their
personality and weirdly enough even in a
place like this with wild cats piss all
over and mold you can still send people
opening the closet and the beautiful
dresses still hang there in order and
talking about getting close to the
places and to the people sometimes you
can get really close so we became
obsessed with this why were all these
places there and we keep showing up and
at a point we decided maybe we should go
beyond the borders of Denmark and see if
we could look things so and actually on
one of our first trips we realized
pretty fast that luckily some of the
places are guarded or protected or
somehow where you don&#39;t want people to
entry because they&#39;re protected from
graffiti artists van der lists junkies
and stop whoever move in but sometimes
these places are God but we find a way
to travel which allowed us to sneak in
at night pass the Goths spend the night
inside and wake up the next morning with
the beautiful light and somebody was
actually looking for us in the
guardhouse outside so we travelled with
light equipment a sleeping bag a tent
some cooking equipment that allowed us
to spend night after night inside these
places only to wake up in the morning in
a place like this this is the old power
plant of Budapest which was shut down
more than 25 years ago and totally
locked down the building it took us a
few nights and we had no idea if it was
there because it was all based on rumors
as so many things we discover we
find them either on our way or they&#39;re
based on rumors because unfortunately
yet there are no Lonely Planet guide to
abandon places of the world so that
allows us to sleep in here and that that
is a glass ceiling a self hanging glass
ceiling that&#39;s been there since 1927 we
also got the experience at the chance to
experience places like a beautiful
castle but I must say that the interior
of this place
had kind of gone mad we really thought
we read up on the story and when the
family who built this castle called Sam
Asano in in Italy they invited Moroccan
Moroccan workers to come and do their
work with tiles and crazy colors
that&#39;s a weird place waking up left
abandoned for no reason still with the
question of why sometimes we get the
answers but very often we don&#39;t we kept
discussing about this phenomenon and we
kept traveling and we kept this going
and said what could be how crazy can
things get what are the things that
people leave behind out there how far
can we imagine this one thing is a
castle and another thing is in power
plant but how about a snake lab so one
morning you&#39;re right we found a snake
lab it&#39;s not that I hate snakes
but if you&#39;re inside a wooden building
with wooden floor that has been
abandoned 15 years ago
it can&#39;t get mushy
and when you have thousand jars of
snakes and formaldehyde on shelves as
soon as you move inside everything moves
[Music]
nothing happened and sometimes things
get a little weird and sometimes the
answers they come to us once we&#39;re in
the place it&#39;s obvious this was a snake
lab we once went inside a beautiful
house in in Germany and we couldn&#39;t
figure out what kind of millionaire
place was this and we were pretty sure
it was a doctor living there and it was
only until we answered after half an
hour on the first floor we realized what
kind of doctor he was we never break in
we never remove anything and we never
staged anything we take things for as
they are and I&#39;ve spent thousand hours
traveling only coming to a place where
we couldn&#39;t enter because we don&#39;t break
a lock we don&#39;t go only if place allows
us to and mostly important we never tell
the location of these places we come
across a lot of valuable stuff of course
and I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a lot of
collectors out there who would trust me
they have called they would gladly know
where are we to find this place if we go
and is it we&#39;re sensation because once
you&#39;re in an abandoned building or an
abandoned place it can it&#39;s kind of like
you have two films going the one thing
is of course taking notice of taking
notice of what&#39;s there now but another
thing is also the movie that runs on
your inhibition what&#39;s not there and
being in an abandoned theme park like
this one this is a copy of course of
Disney World in Japan it&#39;s a huge area
totally abandoned now it&#39;s been taken
over by Nature and thousands of deers
inside it was only us and those dead
quiet
not a single screaming children not the
smell of popcorn just nature beautiful
taken over and what an incredible place
to stay for the day and to spend the
night the project I&#39;m aware of has
raised not just for us a lot of
questions and it&#39;s hard for us to find
the answers but also since we started
going public with the project because in
the beginning we didn&#39;t but the last
five years we&#39;ve gone public with it and
shared this with the world and at some
point there&#39;s a priest who came up and
asked why do you think this is so
fascinating and I went on about the
adventure the traveling the pictures the
adrenaline and everything that would
that got us going for this and he said
you&#39;re wrong not for you guys doing this
stuff but why is this interesting for
everybody else to look at and to share
and to talk about and discuss and read
about he gave us some insights which we
later turn into our own words but I&#39;m
just being honest it was the priest who
was a smart guy and he said we are
living and our entire life in the
Western world pushing away three taboos
in life the taboos of loneliness nobody
wants to be feel lonely or baloney the
taboo of decay we&#39;re all decaying and
the biggest taboo of them all death we
don&#39;t show anything with people but
between the lines that was what he read
and that&#39;s why he gave us the credit for
doing what we&#39;re doing
last year some rumors came to us about a
crazy place in Russia and we decided
we&#39;re gonna raise the bar a little bit
because this looks pretty crazy
inside Russia former USSR now Kazakhstan
in Kazakhstan in the desert Russia has
rented an area called Baikonur the
Baikonur cosmodrome and that is where
since 61 when they sent Gagarin as the
first man in space they&#39;re still
launching space shells every year we
heard the rumor that inside a hangar was
the biggest the most comprehensive the
most expensive and the most secret space
program that was made during the Cold
War it has been left abandoned since 93
so we decided to gear up found some
dollars in our underwear and travel to
this unknown wild destination
trespassing that all night walking
through the desert spending days going
in and finally locating this place and
inside we found this this is the Braun
and it looks similar to the u.s. shuttle
system like discovery and there&#39;s a
reason for that because everything has
been copied from the u.s. back in the
days and we had the chance to sit ask
cosmonauts in the cockpit of this
magnificent piece so I&#39;ve come across a
lot of crazy things in life
crazy abandoned places and I&#39;m still
haunted by the many questions and
sometimes want to look at my pictures I
still don&#39;t get it like this one I shut
this in a hospital in Russia it&#39;s a bath
tub and there&#39;s a meat grinder
and there&#39;s a thingy and I hadn&#39;t I I
still don&#39;t have no idea what&#39;s going on
maybe they like meatloaf or maybe the
patients I don&#39;t know even though this
thing has to do with the taboos of death
visiting those places are some of the
things that makes us feel most alive
thank you very much
you
