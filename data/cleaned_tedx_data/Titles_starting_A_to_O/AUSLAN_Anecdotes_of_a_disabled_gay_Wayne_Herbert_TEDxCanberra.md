good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m
here today to change the way you think
about disability sex and sexuality once
and for all
and to explore with you the power of
social labels and how they have the
potential to impact on a person&#39;s life
in both positive and negative ways for
example what was the first thing you
thought as you saw me walk towards the
red circle this afternoon or perhaps the
first thing you&#39;ve assumed when you&#39;ve
heard me speak despite what you may
think or perhaps have already assumed
did you assume correctly I can confirm
for you ladies and gentlemen that I am a
proud gay man I&#39;m also an occasional
drag queen a senior leader in the
disability employment services sector
and just for balance although to be
perfectly honest with you I don&#39;t have a
great deal of that I&#39;m a person with
disability I have cerebral palsy I alone
can tick almost every one of those
annoying completely sometimes
unnecessary and invasive diversity boxes
they all stand before you today but
ladies and gentlemen you&#39;re in luck
because today I&#39;m not just here to talk
to you I know right scandalous I want to
show you some things too don&#39;t get
scared before we get started though I
just want to be clear that I am in no
way trying to hypnotize you but I
totally understand if you fall in love
we can exchange numbers later there&#39;s no
problem with that but ladies and
gentlemen one of the things I want to
show you is something about me that
attracts the most attention it&#39;s not my
boyish good looks my charm or intellect
no it&#39;s the way that I walk so without
further ado here&#39;s just me the beautiful
Trish and my magic shoes this is the way
that I walk
closely now I can feel the tension in
the room building you&#39;re all staring at
my butt and you&#39;re all falling in love
but ladies and gentlemen because of this
because of the way that I walk I give
myself the coveted title of Australia&#39;s
cheapest and most convincing drunk
that&#39;s because I cannot tell you the
number of times that I have been refused
entry to pubs and nightclubs based
purely on the way that I walk as a
result of my cerebral palsy and on
occasions I&#39;ve been ejected from these
venues even after explaining that I&#39;m
not drunk 24 hours a day seven days a
week
that I&#39;m a person with disability I have
cerebral palsy I&#39;ve been labeled many
things in my life one includes pufta
these are used as a tax on me on many
occasions throughout my life but I&#39;ve
also been labeled a faggot a spastic and
a retard just to name a few now ladies
and gentlemen I know that you might be
confronted by that language but as a 38
year old man I still confront that
language as I stand before you today but
more importantly for me today more
importantly I need to make an apology to
you the audience hashtag I&#39;m so sorry
I&#39;m sorry because what you will discover
today is I&#39;m not inspirational
I&#39;m not amazing I&#39;m not outstanding
and in fact I have the greatest desire
to be anything but exceptional there is
the greatest chance however that what
you will discover from my talk is
nothing
yeah absolutely nothing except I&#39;m just
like you in Australia we are obsessed
with labeling people and this has
happened to me all my life and in fact
ladies and gentlemen I put to you that
if it wasn&#39;t for society and successive
governments constantly reminding me that
I was a person with disability and a
person who is gay I would most probably
forget about it I mean I&#39;m a busy person
I&#39;ve got shit to do
however however whilst I have shit to do
they&#39;re not necessarily the two
attributes that I would necessarily talk
to people about when I first meet them
so I feel like I&#39;ve over shared already
it&#39;s only gonna get worse from here hold
on but ladies and gentlemen I want you
to understand where for me personally
those two attributes sit on a list of 50
things about me now you&#39;ll be quizzed on
this later but I&#39;m gonna show you where
for me personally being a person with
disability and being a person who is gay
actually sits for me on that list and
you&#39;ll notice that number 5 is I&#39;m a
Britney Spears fan she&#39;s a diva just
like me number 10 is I have several
celebrity crushes they just don&#39;t know
it yet
number 12 is I&#39;m a university graduate
and number 49 is I&#39;m a person with
disability and number 50 is I&#39;m a person
who is gay yet I am completely
fascinated by the fact that government
and policy makers and even members of
the community are so busy focusing on
what makes people like me supposedly
different or other all the while
ignoring the qualities and traits that
unite us simply as human beings I&#39;m
gonna let you in on a secret do you want
to know something I do everything you do
and when I say everything I mean
everything for example I regularly
masturbate I have sex and with men and
in my life that&#39;s been several men I get
up every morning and I go to work I earn
a wage and I experience the same
financial freedom that you experience
from employment to some this is amazing
but
I&#39;m here to tell you that nothing I do
is amazing in fact everything I do is
just typical and I&#39;m not sure how as a
country we&#39;ve got to a position where we
tell people with disability that doing
what every other citizen typically
expects to do is somehow inspirational
or amazing but then I thought to myself
long and hard that if I were to be the
Clark Kent
of disability what would I look like
well wait no more ladies and gentlemen
feast your eyes on it pretty hot hey
even if I do say so myself more often
though ladies and gentlemen people like
me and in particular people with
disability are in my view described by
the community and by members of
government using highly negative and
frankly offensive language I don&#39;t know
about you but how many times have you
heard people with disability described
using terms like this limitations
deficit impairment inability do you know
every time I hear people including
members of the public senior public
servants and even in my work ministers
of government using terms like this to
describe people like me my first thought
is shut up how about asking me and the
many millions of people just like me the
terms we might use to describe ourselves
because the one thing that you can be
certain of ladies and gentlemen is that
we would not describe ourselves using
terms like this they are offensive I
want you to think for a moment ladies
and gentlemen but if you woke up
tomorrow and your life had drastically
changed and through a set of
circumstances completely beyond your
control
you were labeled a person
with disability how would you feel how
would you want to be treated by your
family and friends seen by your employer
and colleagues but most importantly how
would you expect to be treated in your
community because although we can
acknowledge much positive change for
people with disability the National
Disability Insurance Scheme for example
and for members of the LGBTQ IQ
community
momentum towards marriage equality I say
with some level of hesitation we&#39;re not
there yet
so let us look at where we are in
Australia in 2017
almost half of lesbian gay bisexual and
transgender people hide their sexual
orientation or gender identity for fear
of discrimination and violence according
to some reports same-sex attracted
Australians have up to 14 times higher
suicide rate attempts than compared to
their heterosexual peers 2.2 million
Australians of working age have a
disability I&#39;m just one of them 46% of
people with disability are not currently
in the Australian labor force
contrast that with 17% of people without
disability this next statistic will
sicken you today in Australia 90% of
women with intellectual disability will
experience some form of sexual assault
in their life and it may shock or
perhaps even horrify you to know that
Australia the so called lucky country
ranks 21 out of 29 Oh a seedy country&#39;s
for the employment participation of
people with disability I just want to be
clear there that in that equation number
one is the top and coincidentally my
favorite number 29 is the bottom 21 is
not good we&#39;ve got lots more to do but
it&#39;s at this point that I want to talk
about the cup of coffee in the room
because ladies and gentlemen what you
may not
is that tens of thousands of people with
disability are already in employment and
they are working for a wage far less per
hour than the cost of that type of
coffee that you pick up every morning on
your way to work without a second
thought this is despite a high court
decision that found this practice to be
discriminatory and I ask ye ladies and
gentlemen would you do your current job
for $3 an hour and if not why not and if
not why then are we so willing to accept
this as a reality for some of the most
vulnerable citizens in our community now
it&#39;s true to say that these statistics
paint a very bleak and sad reality of
what life is like for someone just like
me but it also amazes me that as a
country we constantly fail to recognize
the importance and value of diversity in
all its forms as an example how why has
it taken so long for our community to
recognize and harness the potential of
someone like me and I can tell you why
it&#39;s because of the ever-present weight
of low expectation and that is present
today for everyone with disability and
we need to change that so to do that I
wrote a book anecdotes of a disabled gay
I affectionately call my book my own
personal collection of the shit people
say to a 30 something year old disabled
gay man but I wrote the book for two
reasons one to shed a light on what
people say to me but two because I also
have been the subject of disability
discrimination I also have been the
subject of exclusion I also have been
the subject of unconscious bias and I
see it every day in my work as a leader
in the disability employment services
sector highly skilled talented in
vigils shut out and excluded all because
of the power of a social label this has
to improve ladies and gentlemen because
each and every one of us could tomorrow
be a person with a disability and I&#39;m
sure you would want something better
than this
I&#39;ve come to understand that this is a
conversation we all need to have and
I&#39;ve just been the one to start it well
for the longest time all I thought I was
two people was a poofter a faggot a
spastic and a race hard I come very
quickly to understand that that was only
what they labeled me it is not and nor
will it ever be how I see myself
my parents taught me a very valuable
lesson as a young person and that was
simple but transformative just be just
be me never apologize or compromise that
for anyone and I&#39;m always going to call
out discrimination and social injustice
when I see it and hold a mirror up to
our community and say why is it that we
feel so uncomfortable to engage with
people with disability in a respectful
and sensitive manner and how do we
indeed value the members of our LGBTQ
community and what does this really say
about us as a country ladies and
gentlemen to sum up I mentioned the word
leadership a few times in my talk and I
understand that as a leader what comes
with leadership is responsibility and I
will always be a leader that holds a
hand out to those who need it most
I will always be a voice for the
voiceless a power for the disempowered
and a change agent for everyone and if I
was to ask you now but all I&#39;ve ever
wanted in my life as a person with
disability and a person who is gay is to
be treated equally in my community and
by my country would you now think
that that was too much to ask I
fundamentally believe that if we can
change minds we can change lives I hope
I&#39;ve changed yours today I&#39;m Wayne
Herbert the disabled gay
