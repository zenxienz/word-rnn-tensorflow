hello everyone like you already know my
name is Gil mantas which you don&#39;t know
about me
when I was four or five years old I had
a drowning experience I was learning how
to swim in a lake and I had to swim
along a low pier to make maybe one meter
meter and a half there was a windsurfing
board in front of me and I just had to
make this short distance yet I went
straight down to the bottom to this day
I remember going underwater some weeds
around me small fish swimming by
windsurfing board ahead also Sun glare
someone jumping after me and pulling me
out it wasn&#39;t really dangerous or
anything it happened within a few
seconds I didn&#39;t lose consciousness I
didn&#39;t drink too much water yet it was
quite terrifying to realize how quickly
things can change in the water how
quickly you can lose control and lose
your ground if anybody told me back then
that I would spend most of my life in
and around the water I would have never
believed it yet this is the first
picture of me surfing just a couple
years later in the early 90s nobody
believed that their surfing in Lithuania
or in the Baltic Sea you can imagine
literally just regained independency and
Western culture was still quite alien to
us
we didn&#39;t have even the right equipment
I was riding a windsurfing board just
without the sail I remember coming back
to school after after the summer and
writing an essay how I served during the
summer nobody believed it even the
teacher was laughing at me luckily I had
the picture to prove them wrong so I
didn&#39;t get a bad grade
however this addiction to catch another
wave has literally shaped me as a person
I kept coming back for more and I still
am I might even say that surfing gave me
a reason to be better at anything I do
now before I continue I&#39;d like to ask
you a question how many of you before
entering here today so that there is no
surfing in Lithuania just raise your
hands
just a few well we can continue in the
bar then all right so I&#39;ll take it that
the work we did over the last 10 years
paid off but today I&#39;m surfing the waves
all over the world I&#39;m the founder
president of Lithuania and surfing
Association
I&#39;m also an organizer of surf camp
festival surf camp was instrumental to
bring in surfing to masses in Lithuania
ten years ago mainstream opinion was
pretty clear there is no surfing in the
suena there are no waves even our
friends that used Arthur boards like
skateboard snowboards wind and kite surf
and so on even they didn&#39;t believe that
the waves are good enough for surfing so
we decided that it&#39;s pointless to fight
this opinion and argue about it let&#39;s
invite them for a surf camp a couple
buddies my cousin and I we shaved seven
boards and invited 50 friends to try
surfing that&#39;s how it all started with
50 friends at the beach surfing during
the day listening to music over night
and watching surf movies at the beach 10
years later two thousand people gathered
in brayla this August and we had 480
people trying surfing for the first time
in their life actually surf camp was
growing so fast that we had to scale it
back after year 6 because we weren&#39;t
ready to accommodate so many people and
the whole idea was that surf camp is an
event which is free of charge and we
teach anyone who wants to catch a wave
and to be safe around the water however
thanks to surf camp surfing is not so
uncommon in the Swaney anymore we have
surf schools opening up here and there
we have surf shops local news are
covering our national championships and
local shapers are even producing
Lithuanian surfboards suddenly more and
more Lithuanians are travelling the
world to surf in Spain Portugal Morocco
Latin America and East Asia and part of
the reason for that the biggest part of
the reason
that is surfing itself it&#39;s very hard to
describe the feeling the sensation you
feel when you ride the wave yet this
ever-changing body of water moving wall
of water provides exceptional joy
surfing is one of the has one of the
slowest learning curve it&#39;s very hard
physically yet it&#39;s the same difficult
mentally because you need to learn how
to read the waves you need to understand
where the wave is gonna break what is it
gonna do next and so on
that&#39;s why surfing is a unique sport
because it doesn&#39;t have any
premeditation you can&#39;t have a general
idea or a plan what you want to do yet
it all comes down to the wave that the
ocean will provide you with no two waves
are the same some might be very similar
but most are really different and that&#39;s
why you can&#39;t plan ahead you just have
to be present some scientists believe
that this concentration required and
being present helps to treat some mental
conditions like depression and
post-traumatic stress disorder in
Britain National British Health Service
even provides funding for surf treatment
camps so people who suffer from these
conditions might get some help last year
we held the first surf camp for kids
with autism spectrum disorder here in
Lithuania we follow the international
experience and the results were simply
amazing in the beginning everyone had
their doubts some said the water is too
cold others said kids don&#39;t know how to
swim others said something else the
usual stuff but when the first kid
caught a wave the emotions the smile in
his face was simply priceless I don&#39;t
remember ever seeing so much positive
energy in the air and then everybody
wanted to do that we had a hard time to
bring them out of the water they were
all late for lunch all of this all of
these experiences weren&#39;t possible if I
didn&#39;t try surfing 25 years ago but
people say that is the journey that
matters not the destination and
I think that everything that happens in
between the waves in between riding the
wave is just as important the tiring
travels across the world the waiting in
the airport or in the surfing spot
waiting for the swell to show up fatigue
excitement all of that adds up each wave
has a story what did it take for you to
get there and to catch it what did you
have to overcome what did you have to
sacrifice what coincidence and steered
you towards it every wave is an
adventure and one of those adventures
happened four years ago in Morocco we
were on a surf trip with a couple of
friends and this particular spot we were
surfing in had a big rip currents in it
what is a rip current a rip current is a
water stream that goes straight out to
the ocean
if you imagine waves breaking at the
beach you could realize quickly that the
waves won&#39;t the waters not going to
climb uphill it has to come back to the
ocean so usually the water finds a
channel and go straight back to the
ocean this particular place this
particular rip current was as wide as
the stage I&#39;m standing on right now and
moving as fast as seven kilometers an
hour which is a regular walking pace
so you can imagine that&#39;s quite a lot of
water moving around so on a pretty big
day my buddy Marius and me we paddled
out and at the end of the channel we
heard a cry for help so high steam our
he still remembers the story so there
was a guy the body boarder without fins
floating around doesn&#39;t seem too bad
well he was half a kilometre out the sea
so we tried to even some pointers some
advice what to do where to go how to
come in safely to the shore but we
quickly came to realize that he&#39;s not
gonna make it on his own so much for
surfing big waves we had to help the
poor fella
if it wasn&#39;t for us nobody knows how it
had how would he have ended because
there was nobody else in the water and
you couldn&#39;t see him from the from the
beach so me and me and Marius we took
turns by dragging the guy while he was
holding on our feet and what do you do
when you&#39;re in the rip current there&#39;s
it&#39;s pointless to paddled against the
stream because it will wear you down and
get the better of you the only way to
escape the stream is to go perpendicular
to the stream far enough so it doesn&#39;t
affect you anymore and only then you can
come back to the shore on one side we
had a rocky point on the other side
there was three kilometers of sandy
beach it was clear that we&#39;re gonna go
to the south for at least a kilometer so
we far enough from the current and then
we can come back to safety when we reach
the beach break we didn&#39;t want to
endanger ourselves and stop for a minute
to explain to the guy how we&#39;re gonna
proceed next having two boards board
leashes a clueless beach goer with us
meant danger once the real threat
presents itself you couldn&#39;t really
expect what he was going to do and we
didn&#39;t really want to entangle ourselves
with him this proved to be a crucial
mistake because the feeder current took
us back another half a kilometer in
three minutes so we had to start over
again half way back after some time a
local school owner paddled out on a big
board on a longboard so it was easier
for him to help us and it was more
efficient to drag the pool fella in and
according to my GPS watch it took us one
hour and three kilometres of paddling
until we finally got him to safety he
was in shock perhaps hypothermic and
medics took medics took over once on the
beach if this whole experience taught me
one thing you have to be aware if you&#39;re
around the water you have to be present
you have to be aware you have to know
what&#39;s happening this lost concentration
for a couple of minutes
did cost us another
20 minutes of paddling in other cases in
other instances the cost might be much
higher but then let&#39;s step out of the
water how a where are we in our everyday
life how many of you felt that sometimes
the life is carrying you like a current
like you&#39;re not controlling your
everyday life you go to work you hate
because everybody does you took a
mortgage on your house or apartment
because everybody does you do things you
have to but not the things you want to
it&#39;s pointless to fight the stream and
if you want to go somewhere you&#39;ll have
to find the way around so if you stop
and look around and define what is
happening to you only then you can
understand where you are worried being
taken only then you can determine your
next goal where you want to go define
the obstacles and find the way around
and if we reflect on my childhood
experience I drowned
not because I didn&#39;t know how to swim
everybody in this auditorium knows how
to swim or at least how to float in the
water that&#39;s in our body we can float I
drowned because I didn&#39;t even try so
that&#39;s what people do when they lose
ground they try to reach for the bottom
and usually they reach the bottom but
not in the way they want to so my tip
for all of you if you suddenly lose your
ground and start drowning just stick
your head up and swim to safety thank
you
