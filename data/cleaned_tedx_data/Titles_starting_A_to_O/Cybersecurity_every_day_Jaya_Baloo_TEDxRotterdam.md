how many of you have Wi-Fi enabled on
your phone take a look take a look and
put your hand up please
yep how many of you have Bluetooth
enabled on your phone ok we&#39;ve been
scanning the entire morning and we found
42 vulnerable phones in this room and we
found one phone it&#39;s Ricardo&#39;s iPhone
and I&#39;m not going to show you the crazy
sheet porn because I don&#39;t freak you out
but let me show you something else
Ricardo was looking at whenever the next
slide is there so Ricardo was checking
out the program I know this is gonna
take balls but where&#39;s Ricardo who&#39;s
Ricardo Oh Ricardo hi
so Ricardo have you updated your phone
in the last three days to overcome the
wpa2 attack you have not okay
Ricardo can you just take a look at your
screen can we take a look at a screen
there we go oh it went to screen server
here&#39;s the deal how often do you guys
update your phone when there are updates
available I wanted to see one show of
hands who updates their phone every time
there&#39;s an update available okay there&#39;s
a lot of who doesn&#39;t do it yeah okay
I count roughly 42 hands so here&#39;s the
deal
the point is society needs to wake up
and smell the coffee cybersecurity is
part of our daily lives we need to
practice cybersecurity each and every
day if we want to be safe we live in a
connected world in fact it&#39;s just gonna
get more connected you&#39;ve got speaker on
speaker talking to you today about how
connected we all are and you know what
we&#39;re gonna do we&#39;re not just gonna
connect you to each other we&#39;re gonna
connect all the things to each other so
our future looks like this our future
looks like we take all the dumb things
we have now yeah and then we make them
smart by connecting them to each other
okay I want to ask you like a real-life
question how many times have you
encountered it happening that you&#39;ve got
two dumb people you seat them together
at a party and suddenly they win the
Nobel Prize how likely is it to happen
in our virtual world that we take two
dumb devices we let them talk to each
other and suddenly they&#39;re smart for me
everything that smart has an inherent
vulnerability and when you look at the
Oxford definition of IOT it actually
will tell you that the only way that it
will crumble is because of a failure in
security I want to talk about one case
in point
does anybody have one of these vacuuming
robots at home oh yeah you do who has
this particular one from LG yeah you do
right you got to get that updated a
couple of days ago actually three days
ago what was announced is that this
robot will turn your smart home into a
spy home because what the hacker can do
is turn on the camera that&#39;s used to
activate this robot you know that makes
the map when it&#39;s kind of back
in your home and it&#39;ll use it to spy on
you you&#39;re gonna get that updated yeah
right yep so you know it&#39;s one thing
when I&#39;m when I&#39;m telling you about your
smartphone it&#39;s another thing when I&#39;m
talking to you about your connected
vacuum cleaner but folks we need to
really wake up because I need to tell
you it is beyond irritating when all of
these you know so-called smart devices
collude work together and then staged a
distributed denial of service attack
this happened last year it actually
brought down one of the most critical
infrastructure pieces we all know can
you guess what it was that&#39;s right
Netflix Netflix
brought tumbling down to its knees so
you know growth of global population
resulted in failure of Netflix and what
it really means is that we need to start
paying attention because this is gonna
bring down other pieces of
infrastructure this is a real map this
is not fake you can google this now it&#39;s
called the digital attack map it&#39;s
brought to you by all the people that
are like working to defend against D
doses across the world and this is live
traffic from just a few days ago this is
this year ok this is the global
distributed denial of traffic traffic
and as it&#39;s getting you know more and
more and more the cost of executing such
an attack is getting less in fact how
many of you have working companies how
many of you have competitors keep those
hands up all right
in order to knock out your competitors
it&#39;ll cost you roughly about a hundred
and fifty US dollars kill your
competitor for a week sounds pretty good
right and it&#39;s not a joke and you know
when we open the newspapers today it&#39;s
every day it&#39;s a new data breach so we
saw that the entire government of Sweden
was compromised this last summer the
entire record of everyone who had a
driver&#39;s license or an aviation license
all of their data was breached they
actually even mailed the database out
and no a separate marketing action we
saw Equifax I&#39;m not even going to talk
to you about that because I expect you
to know that one the clue is that these
data breaches aren&#39;t there like when you
have a credit card number breach because
when a credit card gets breached what do
you do
the credit card company you have them
block the card you maybe get a new card
and then you&#39;re fixed right right what
happens when your base in your passport
number your driver&#39;s license number when
all of the infant every place you&#39;ve
ever lived you know when it comes to
Equifax every kind of credit students
you&#39;ve ever had all of this information
is compromised
it&#39;s not about monitoring or changing
one credit card
this kind of data breach will follow you
around for the rest of your life
we need to wake up
when we talked about the hack that I
told you I did which I didn&#39;t Ricardo is
working with me on this one
I didn&#39;t hack you cuz it would be
illegal for the caesar of kpn to hack a
group in the Dula but if I were to hack
you I could because it&#39;s actually based
on a real attack and it&#39;s actually based
on a real update that iPhone really
issued that you really did not go and
gather and I&#39;m sure that you also didn&#39;t
go and get the same update that&#39;s
available for Android telephones so
everything I did is for reals I just
needed to not really hack you today but
it&#39;s all possible there&#39;s another attack
that&#39;s a operating over Bluetooth called
Blu born it&#39;s both of these attacks are
terrifying because they&#39;re operating at
the most basic level of the protocol
that&#39;s enabling the communication when
this goes wrong everything gets affected
and everything that&#39;s connected becomes
more vulnerable and you can say you know
what it&#39;s my phone it&#39;s fine but what
happens when it&#39;s your pacemaker also
not a joke this summer st. Jude Medical
had issued an announcement that they had
five hundred thousand pacemakers that
were already in humans that were
vulnerable and needed a software upgrade
but it was a voluntary recall which
means like I accidentally put it
something incredibly vulnerable like a
scalpel in your body but it&#39;s up to you
if you want me to get that removed so
when we have medical manufacturers not
taking cybersecurity seriously we have
by the way this is also true less than
two weeks ago
you saw Anna spate you saw plastic
surgery clinics being hacked and what
they do is they take
all the data and they threatened to
publish the information on the clients
including members of the royal family if
they don&#39;t get paid to a Bitcoin address
so this is a very vulnerable spot of our
civilization if we want to talk true
vulnerability though what happens when
we talk about vulnerable military
equipment with a nuclear payload this is
not a fake image this is an image of an
f-16 flying above Rotterdam this is not
a fake image what happens when we hack
it when it turns into an unmanned
aircraft and you can control it remotely
but it has a missile payload then we&#39;re
talking anew about a new way to think
about cyber security then it&#39;s not just
about me getting Ricardo&#39;s iphone the
reason that I&#39;m worried is because for
the last maybe 15 years we&#39;ve paid more
attention to wargames our prioritization
has been screwed up because we&#39;ve been
worried about how to get to our enemies
by making them vulnerable instead of
worrying about something called
information assurance which is how do we
protect ourselves how do we protect our
critical infrastructure and because of
this screwed up prioritization thing
this is why we&#39;re in the problems we&#39;re
in now and you know when you take a look
at just how bad it is it&#39;s really bad
this is a picture from the Snowden
documents where it tells you that
governments and the specifically
intelligence agencies have cooperated
with hardware vendor software
manufacturers service providers to
basically have ubiquitous surveillance
capability across the chipset across the
hardware across the telecommunications
providers and these companies they have
no choice if they don&#39;t work with the
intelligence agencies they will lose
their license to operate take a look at
the legislation that&#39;s happening in our
very country the referendums that are
happening now how involved are you in
this public debate and how much do you
take it home with you do you actually
give a damn a cybersecurity a part of
your everyday life when it comes to how
society is being
ermand for us it is at kpn we realized
that our innocence was lost when we saw
the example of Belgium in Belgium that
was hacked through a corporation of the
NSA working together with the GCHQ they
used an incredibly expensive piece of
malware called Regin which used a very
expensive thing called zero-days it
actually used for zero days and a zero
days is a vulnerability that even the
vendor the manufacturer of the device or
thing knows about for zero day so they
don&#39;t know and these vulnerabilities out
there in the wild attacking and this
zero days are made by anyone who will
pay for them so you have a group of
digital mercenaries that will make you a
zero-day if you pay them enough and what
we see is that these kind of mercenaries
this is the hacking team this is the
equation group they will work for
whoever but this one in particular
worked for the NSA and they built the
NSA a zero-day you may have heard of
this zero day because it was called
wanna cry and this zero day affected
companies that cost them hundreds of
millions of dollars and actually
completely debilitated their
infrastructure the example here is a PM
terminals you know wrote the dome to
have a yeah Marisa okay the difficulty
thing here is is that we don&#39;t know who
actually did it who actually released it
who actually brought it out we have
another group calling themselves the
shadow brokers but there&#39;s no big screen
that says ooh
hacking detected like you see in the
movies so it&#39;s a lot of legwork from
forensic ators to try to figure out was
that this guy was it you know this what
he would call him again
and Rocketman you know was it the
Chinese or was it the Israelis it&#39;s
probably all of them working together
because when you look at the real story
which supposedly happened follow me for
a moment
apparently this guy over here working at
the NSA took his work home using a
laptop that he shouldn&#39;t have out of
work with no real good security software
the russians hacked a group called
Kaspersky that was providing him the
antivirus but the Israelis were actually
hacking the Russians who hacked the
Americans
you&#39;re still with me and they&#39;re
somewhere in here probably the French
are involved too although I&#39;m not sure
of that so you know it&#39;s a very complex
world and this world is getting more
complex by the fact that we should
realize at some point in time that
surveillance and these kinds of counter
surveillance techniques are not just
employed on big countries but on the
backs of all of us so when you take a
look at it there are actual like
satellites that are launched this is the
National Reconnaissance Office they
actually they also do fashion wear so
they issue a patch every time they
launched a new reconnaissance satellite
and with catchy phrases like nothing is
beyond our reach and they spy on global
telecommunications yours not just the
you know bad guys or the Israelis or the
Chinese or whatever your communication
is currently at risk and they actually
store it all - they have a gigantic data
center in Utah where they keep all this
communication and the goal the XPrize if
you will of this community is to launch
a quantum computer that cannot just get
to that global communications traffic
that&#39;s in the open but also that
encrypted traffic that&#39;s meant to be
closed and when they have that quantum
computer they will use it to unlock
everyone&#39;s secrets not that the
communication that&#39;s happening now but
everything that was ever stored as well
so all of the things that you&#39;ve ever
sent Plus that you&#39;re ever going to send
is at risk with a quantum computer so
what does China do well they built a mm
long kilometer network and they launched
their own satellite to have a fully
encrypted link so that even when there
is a quantum computer that their data
will be safe what&#39;s the Dutch quantum
computing strategy what&#39;s yours
when it comes to your company what I
want to tell you is very simple we can
actually solve this problem we can take
control of our cybersecurity future even
though we can&#39;t maybe determine what
happened in our past so the potential
here is huge because you can do updates
you can choose which hardware and
software you use you can like really
determine how you upgrade you know how
you do two-factor authentication you can
do all of those things but fundamentally
you can do one thing which will change
the entire game you can push the
envelope back you can give it back to
the hardware and software vendors that
should not just take up the
responsibility but get the liability for
delivering us safe and secure products
it should be their responsibility
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a loan to make sure
that every hardware software a platform
or service that you all use is enabled
at default by design and all through its
lifecycle until we&#39;re done with it
the deal is I want us to enjoy our
connected future I want you to be able
to talk to each other and to you know
turn on your home robot so that the cat
pair can be vacuumed when you&#39;re not at
home I want you to be able to do that
but I want you to also do that without
fear without worrying about is that
thing spying on you or looking at your
children playing or you know is it doing
things that it was never meant to do so
I need you to enjoy technology and
safety and security and give it the
place that it deserves which is part of
your everyday life thank you
[Applause]
