so before I was a machine learning
scientist I was a teenager I was a
teenager growing up in Lagos Nigeria
during the heady days of hip-hop
nineties hip-hop the soundtrack of my
youth was Snoop Doggy Dogg and dr. Dre
salt and pepper and jay-z all this and
MTV during periods of intermittent power
so you&#39;ll be there watching television
rhyming along and they will take lights
they&#39;ll take the power just go out and
that&#39;s how I grew up one particular
summer it felt like we&#39;re under siege
there was virtually no power all the
time
two weeks into this thing I became so
bored I could pull my hair out my older
siblings had already found a solution
for boredom they would read books but I
was too cool for that I&#39;m not gonna
spend my time reading books for fun I&#39;m
three weeks into this siege with the
Power Company that felt like a passage I
decided eventually to go and read a book
because I was the only one bored
everybody else had something to do the
book I read was called because I am
involved it was about by Cornell or juku
on his chronicles of his experience of
the Nigerian Biafra and civil war of his
involvement in that experience that book
completely changed my experience with
books and I realized that an entirely
new world awaited me all I had to do was
just open a book my high school was a
six story building with a lot of glass
for some bizarre reason and my class was
on the fourth floor and in the mid
afternoon heat with the windows all open
mr. naka will come into the class and
will stand this mandatory computer
science period now I totally was not
interested in this computer science
thing he will go on talking about
arithmetic and logic unit
CPU and all these things multiplexers
and I was just like my eyes would glaze
over
I was completely bored completely
uninterested disaffected I did just
enough to pass so I would never have to
take it again
I thought that was it I&#39;ll pass this
class I would never have to use this
computer thing again fast forward a
couple of years I end up in the states
in Memphis Tennessee the home of Elvis
that&#39;s all I knew about Memphis before I
got there I was at lemoyne-owen College
a historically black university and they
required every single incoming student
to take a computer literacy class I
thought to myself I&#39;m back again in this
computer thing however something magical
happened
I discovered this thing called the
Internet and they blew my mind it was
just like wow I was I was just I was
done I got I fast forward into the
future I was like you know what
okay I&#39;m gonna age myself this is 1996
1997 the first thing don&#39;t judge me
the first thing that came to my mind
would be there will be online shopping I
will shop online and I can also get
information it completely changed my
idea and my emotional relationship with
the idea of a computer that Internet the
application of the internet changed my
entire relationship with something
called a computer I in hindsight are me
I realized that what has happened is
what Seymour popper one of the founding
fathers of AI talks about he says
anything is inherently easy to learn as
long as you can integrate it to some
structures that you already have
especially if you have a positive effect
with the structures that is you think
about these things and warm and fuzzies
come to your mind so for me was Internet
online shopping woman fuzzy I&#39;m gonna be
a computer scientist that was it I was
like I&#39;m gonna be a computer scientist
it wasn&#39;t a big deal and that was it I
became a computer
scientist the thing about knowledge is
it&#39;s like a building that&#39;s how I
started thinking about knowledge and my
whole question now became all right I&#39;m
gonna be a computer scientist how am I
going to acquire the knowledge of what
it takes to be a computer scientist one
of my friend a philosopher
often says knowledge is not infused it
is acquired knowledge is like a building
and the process of acquiring the
knowledge you saw this convoluted neural
net networks the process of acquiring
knowledge is like extending that
building the most important thing is in
that process two things happen knowledge
takes on logical form like we can reason
if this happened this happens don&#39;t
drink don&#39;t drive you won&#39;t go to jail
drink drive jail logical form the second
important thing is it takes on emotional
form don&#39;t drink don&#39;t drive no Jill yeh
drink drive jail bad for knowledge to
come into your life and to break tech
holes two things happen logical form
emotional form it&#39;s very much like
Thanksgiving so Thanksgiving is coming
up soon and imagine what you wanted to
do was to learn to make the perfect
Thanksgiving turkey so there you are you
go to Thanksgiving turkey dinner school
and they take you to the Test Kitchen
and you spent the first year perfecting
brining before you do learning how to
brine a turkey you know the right salt
water maybe summer nice and then when
you perfect that they tell you all right
you&#39;re gonna move on and now you&#39;re
going to be creaming cranberries the
cream the cranberries creme de creme bus
an entire years gone by and you&#39;re not
anywhere closer to actually making your
turkey the same goal another scenario
this time you actually start in
someone&#39;s home been invited to a
Thanksgiving dinner
you sit at the table take up your entire
surrounding you soak in the joy the left
the warmth that occurs when you&#39;re
sharing a meal with people you care
about and all the emotional
effectiveness enters your system and
then they now say after this experience
go back to the Test Kitchen and we&#39;ll
start you at the Bryan Station from
brining you move on you move on these
two scenarios but have a viable path
towards the final goal but guess which
one will be more successful in the long
run a perfecting technique without ever
seen the end goal or be starting from
the end goal and working away backwards
which one do you guys think will be the
most successful be one of the most
important things is just like the book
that reminded me about the joy of
learning or made me discover the joy of
reading because I am involved whenever
you want to learn anything
once you become personally involved
something about the whole thing changes
for you
we all know that knowledge is not
infused it is acquired everybody knows
that the challenge of learning then
becomes the process of knowledge
acquisition one of the interesting
things and enduring myths around
intelligence and the nature of
intelligence is this myth of innate
ability this myth often comes up
especially when we start talking about
things that tend towards the abstract
things like computer science things like
artificial intelligence in its ability
in its ability it comes up there&#39;s even
a school of thought that believes that
only 2% of humans are even capable of
acquiring the knowledge that our brains
are wired in such a way that only
special 2% of us have the literal neural
capacity to acquire complex hierarchical
knowledge as a computer scientist I mean
I would like to believe I&#39;m special and
I&#39;m some parts of only 2% however I know
that this is absolutely not true
because of my own experiences it cannot
be the case because knowledge is not
infused knowledge is a core
it and most importantly knowledge comes
along with an emotional results so just
like that book I mentioned because I am
involved once I discovered the internet
and became super excited that online
shopping would happen one day no matter
how silly that sounded
I was literally now involved in this
thing and I wanted to be part of
whatever it is that built that future I
became involved in computer science not
because I wanted to learn how to program
I became involved because I wanted to
understand the fundamental frameworks
that allowed inventions like this to
occur so that I could manipulate it and
twist it in whatever ways that I saw fit
I found something that interested me I
became involved somehow
I learned everything I needed to learn
to build the world that I wanted to see
along with that myth also is this idea
that their computer science people that
some people are just born there poets
some people are born there artists some
people are born there computer science
people it&#39;s not necessarily the case
computation is a broad thing and it has
enough room to accommodate every single
person there is enough room in
computation for the poet the writer the
musician the fashion designer basically
computation applied to whatever field
enhances that field and takes that field
to the next level so if you&#39;re a writer
and you apply computation you create
something entirely new perhaps
algorithmic screenplays if you&#39;re a
musician and you apply computation maybe
you do utter to you yes do you build
things like that and this is exactly the
kinds of things that I did while I was
doing my doctoral work at UC Berkeley
because of my youth I enjoyed hip-hop
naturally for me the next nights are
about is she
I wonder if I could actually use
computation to enhance my enjoyment of
this art form I particularly liked hip
hop not necessarily for the beats I
liked it for the narrative storytelling
so driving to the lab driving back I
would listen to jay-z&#39;s discography over
and over and over again and I find
myself having arguments with myself
about the lyrics and at one point I was
like why am I doing this why don&#39;t I
just write some code and actually like
you know and some of these arguments I
keep having to myself and I was like woo
I actually could write actually parse
these lyrics so I decided that I&#39;m gonna
build this data science unit called
hip-hop a--they merging the two words
hip hop and empathy the idea that if I
minded enough of this code perhaps I
could put myself in the same mind space
of the poet and I could see the world
through their perspective and I thought
perhaps students could actually see this
as well and if they did this they would
see that computation was not necessarily
just strictly for people who thought of
themselves as computer science people
now maybe I could pool in the Ryder pool
in the port and pull in the artists we
build this data science unit we looked
at it it was fun and we moved on but
something special happened when I did
this I discovered something I didn&#39;t
think I was going to discover I
discovered that rap lyrics have a very
very similar structure to the structure
of the ephah corpus of my own native
Yoruba cosmology without bringing
computation to rap I would never have
made that discovery these are the kinds
of things that happen when computation
is brought to bear on different new
fields we create an entirely new world
of delights we are here in San Francisco
at the cusp of the fourth Industrial
Revolution it is no longer gonna be good
enough to say only 2% of the world are
going to be computer science people for
example we know
that AI is being used for risk
assessments and sometimes when we&#39;re
building this algorithms because we&#39;re
so distant from those worlds and for
those people who&#39;s who this algorithms
impact it does even occur to us to ask
certain kinds of questions when people
that are algorithms
impact our designing those algorithms
they see it from a completely different
point of view
computer science is no longer going to
be a nice to have it&#39;s actually going to
be unnecessary the fourth Industrial
Revolution is get is either gonna be the
beginning of some mad mask dystopian
future oh it&#39;s going to be the beginning
of a glorious era it all depends on
whether you you you will step in and
join me in computation I am the same
person that learned credence to the idea
of the myth of innate ability because I
was disinterested I was not involved
the assumption is oh she&#39;s probably one
of the ninety-eight percent that can
learn it I found an application all that
change guess what I&#39;m an anti scientist
the same person that lends credence to
the myth is the same person that is the
proven the very same myth the reason why
a lot of people are not choosing CS is
because sometimes they have phobia or
they don&#39;t see themselves as those CS
type people because we know that humans
are inherently teachable that knowledge
is not infused it is a quiet the happy
things happen where you bring
computation to bear into your own field
I ask you to dare to come into this
field with me and start your own journey
into computer science thank you
you
