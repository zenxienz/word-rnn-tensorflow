thank you I&#39;m here to talk about
substance abuse substance you&#39;re very
familiar with substance you maybe even
addicted to it
substance we all need to sustain life as
we know what I&#39;m talking about
yes water so let&#39;s start subject water
so how much water do you really need to
sustain life just for drinking purpose a
gallon a day how much water you really
use to conduct your life another 99
gallons a day that&#39;s when you take
washing cleaning you know all those
activities flushing and that&#39;s 100
gallons per person per day let me let me
take you a little different journey
about unconscious use of the water and
you will be surprised how much water do
you think it takes to make a hamburger
600 gallons let me continue on 37
gallons of water to make a cup of coffee
here we go you will see it takes 2,500
gallons of water to make a pound of
chocolate I can keep going and just just
watch David weigh 700 gallons of water
to produce a t-shirt here we you want
some shocking numbers you ready
120,000 gallons of water to manufacture
a car you know I can keep keep going on
and on and they&#39;ll get absurd and absurd
the point is the point is that all this
water I just mentioned is food grade
drinkable water it&#39;s the water you all
drink and it&#39;s the same water being used
to do all those things now let&#39;s let&#39;s
think about it we have the problem is
the problem is we have a finite amount
of water on
this earth 70% of our water yeah we have
a Earth&#39;s surface covered with 70% of
water but only 1% of that water is
usable fresh water we happen to be very
very fortunate just she said on the
great lakes where 20% of this 1% water
is in your backyard in Chicago in Great
Lakes but that doesn&#39;t mean we have a
right to be abused of this water water
has not changed
we are using the same water dinosaurs
used millions of years ago we we
received the water we will see the same
water when the planet inception took
place and we need to be very mindful
about it what we are we going with it
because if we don&#39;t if we don&#39;t do it
let me tell you what can happen I was
born in a refugee camp in India my first
12 years of life my family used to
receive a bucket of water a day and my
ration of that bucket was one glass a
day I used to spend my old I spent my
whole childhood seeking water looking
for water finding water chasing monkeys
to find the streams of water wondering
how the nature cultivates how the nature
recycles the water how the nature deals
with water and sustain the life on this
planet without the massive systems that
we created as humans to support the
supply of water to all of us and even
abuse it because we are abusers and when
you think about it
then I happen to have my family happened
to be very you know God out of the camps
I happened to go to a prestigious
engineering college in India right after
the college I ended up by some situation
on the ships in the oceans of the world
now I am surrounded by 90% of the world
water supply still not a drop to drink I
mean it was amazing so
and and I said well on the ships I learn
how we recycle the water on the ship
they do not use any water for washing
and cleaning the decks or other purposes
that&#39;s all seawater to seawater the only
fresh water we generate is used for
drinking and consumption or sorry
cooking so I said well and they mimic
the systems of the oysters the clean
fifty gallons of water a day in the
oceans you may not be aware of it and I
said well there&#39;s something to be
learning here we need to learn something
over here with the sea fast forward fast
forward I emigrated to the USA now here
now I run an engineering company right
here in Chicago and other states where
we specializes in water and wastewater
treatment plants so that tells you I
know something about water in the wastes
of the water boat then I started
learning how we really deliver you the
water I don&#39;t know how many of you
really know how the water comes to you
it comes from water treatment plants
often maybe even up to hundred miles
away from the cities and municipalities
they serve it goes through a network of
thousand miles of pipes and pumps and
before it gets to your houses and the
buildings
and from there and let me let me make
this example a little more simple for
you and then from there this is like
your house you very familiar with it you
will see there&#39;s only two lines coming
to your house there&#39;s a clean water you
have no choice by the way you know it&#39;s
not your fault I&#39;m just trying to let
you know so so there&#39;s a clean water
line coming in and there&#39;s a one
sanitary line we call it that leaves all
the discharge that you have so all your
shower water all your flushing water or
your cooking water it comes all food
grade drinkable water you can drink from
the toilet bowl you can drink in your
shower you can drink anywhere in your
house from your washing machine that
water is very clean it&#39;s the same water
come your kitchen faucet you may use
filter once a while so now let&#39;s see
what happens after you discharge this
water into the sanitary line what
happened it goes
pack another one hundreds of miles away
with thousands of miles of piping
network back to the treatment plan
discharges back to the rivers and ocean
and we pollute them in the process and
this system is so old and it&#39;s leaking
20% of it it&#39;s contaminating all Warren
lands and the resources that as we know
and we I said what is this and we&#39;ve
been asked as engineering company to
repair and replace the old system just
just keep it going and not do anything
innovative that made me thinking this is
going to my childhood I said why don&#39;t
we think why don&#39;t we make the system
like the water management system of a
tree and that started the process of
microgrids thinking the micro girl
instead of macro system that we all know
so micro grids three as you can see have
the root system which we call the micro
grid system of rule that filters stores
and cleans and recycles and reuse the
same water in a tree and over the
lifetime of the tree it cleans thirty
six thousand five hundred gallons of
water to support these branches and the
leaves throughout the lifetime of tree
see how much water it clean I mean doing
a great favor to all of you thirty six
thousand five hundred gallons so now let
me see if we can bring this micro grid
into your own house the house is back
again you see there is no sanitary line
no there&#39;s nothing getting out of the
house the only thing that you receive
here is a fresh water just for drinking
use and cooking how much is that maybe
two or three gallons per person a day
versus hundred gallons per person a day
see how dramatic changes taking place in
the system now everything is recycled
and even the dirtiest most water from
your toilet we call a black water is
being recycled to water your lawns and
Gardens because of the high fertilizer
content in it and it is there okay now
and and the new purple and the new
recycled water the color you probably
all like it&#39;s a purple water we call it
maybe not fully food grade drinkable
water but it&#39;s the purple water now
let&#39;s keep going on in now what happens
is we
to pick the system and expand the system
of micro-grid I just explained to you in
a single how to our series because we we
have no choice because if you know the
estimate 50 70 % of the world population
will be living in our cities by 2050
it&#39;s this is all the data is out there
and all all the abusers substance
abusers you know we call it or I call it
water a hallux we you know that&#39;s the
term I call the water the Horlicks we&#39;ll
be moving to the cities and once they
move to the cities the cities may not be
able to sustain the water supplies and
the requirements that we will have the
way we know it so what we need to do we
need to expand this micro grid concepts
to the city and and mimic the nature&#39;s
of water systems in the city in your
smart city before the Nature outsmarts
us in it&#39;s already outsmarting us so you
can see it&#39;s happening all over nature
is like taking over so we need to be
very mindful of preserving the nature
let me see how though let me show you
how the the mini grids or micro grid
systems in the city will look like here
we go it will look like the mini grid
systems or micro grid systems of cluster
of trees in the forest now think about
the forest there&#39;s so many trees think
about the cities so many buildings how
does it look like so when you mimic this
cluster of tree or micro grid system of
a tree and bring it to the cities like
in the forest it will look something
like this so we can have our own root
system under every building a micro grid
under the building to recycle to reuse
to reduce and the water the waste water
I&#39;m talking about the water that you
abuse the water that you don&#39;t need to
go for drinking or cooking the water
just need for washing and cleaning and
all other non-food great drinkable
purposes because the water and for that
this will reduce now I told you how
massive the system is how wasteful the
system is how old the system is and this
system takes that away do you see a
little one macro system there&#39;s one line
coming from more treatment plants just
for drinking water use only
or food grade drinkable water and when
you rest of the water is being recycled
just like the roots of the tree and
reefs clean stored recycle reserving
back to the building for non drinkable
juice like fire protection system
sprinkler system even your fountains
cleaning the streets I mean think about
why you want to clean the street from a
drinking water while you want to have a
fire protection system with the drinking
water it&#39;s supposed to only fire the
fight you know fight the fire so given
that this system is what we need to help
because if all these people are
migrating to cities we know water holux
and you can have a water alcoholism
because you can drink as much you want
and don&#39;t waste that you don&#39;t need for
drinking or cooking purpose that&#39;s the
point here and this system will be so
efficient it can save 30% of your energy
and recover 50% of the water supply
which is so pressure because substance
we need to sustain not to get high on so
this is the something we need to really
understand very very clearly so we&#39;ve
given that now this technology does
exist I recently went to Israel on a
mission with Rahm Emanuel the mayor of
over here and I personally drank
recycled beverage over there they clean
this wastewater so good it&#39;s a food
grade over there because they are not
fortunate to have the water supplies
like we have in the Great Lakes or the
rivers so they recycle everything they
have no choice now some areas in
California also they&#39;re bringing this
this recycling system they&#39;re taking the
wastewater they&#39;re taking industrial
waste and recycling as a purple water
which I just explained to you going back
to agricultural use industrial use or
not drinkable uses over there so the
point is the point is that if we need to
be very mindful about it we need to be
in sync with the nature we need to have
in those smart cities water system like
the Nature does with the trees or the
oysters do in the oceans and because you
don&#39;t do it if you don&#39;t do it this away
from the macro system going to the micro
system I am afraid very afraid
there will be generation of humans
coming who will be facing the struggle I
faced living on one glass of water thank
you
