yesterday I took the bus to school the
choice purely motivated by the fact it
was raining outside and I didn&#39;t want to
get wet and I didn&#39;t think about my
decision again until I saw the bus
rumbling down the road towards me
stopping in a cloud of dust and I began
to wonder whether my decision had been
correct
ethically correct now although public
transport is normally viewed in a
positive light my decision had helped
create more pressure on the bus
companies to put more buses on the roads
and thus we are increasing the amount of
pollution in our atmosphere and
ultimately speeding up the rate of
global warming I mean none of these are
ethically sound things and given the
same information before almost certainly
wouldn&#39;t have made the same decision so
I stepped on the bus and pulled out my
phone and having already questioned the
ethics of the bus I decided it would
only be fair if my phone received the
same Grillin phones are integral to our
society today they entertain connect and
even frustrate us and their integration
to our society has grown so much that
there&#39;s even been a psychological
disorder named after the fear of being
without one no more phobia and because
these phones are so integral to our
society we often are on the lookout for
the latest phone the newest piece of
technology and as with making any
decision we often ask ourselves
questions while we&#39;re doing this and in
this case the questions might go
something like this how fast is it does
it take good photos or can I shove it in
my bag or in my pocket and I mean all
these questions are all very good things
to ask I&#39;m sure like to ask you have you
ever asked yourself how ethical is this
phone here are some statistics 40% of
your phone is comprised from metals and
these metals include gold silver and
platinum gold is a finite material not
the mooned is still being extracted from
less economically developed countries in
Africa and South America where at the
moment there&#39;s still tens of thousands
of child labourers working in mines
today but there&#39;s only 0.03 four grams
of gold in our phone surely this
ught amount of gold doesn&#39;t make us
responsible for a massive problem like
child labor but when you take into
consideration the fact that we&#39;re
endorsing companies that make in one
case 45 and a half million of these
phones in just three months then you
begin to realize that the amount of gold
used and that we&#39;re endorsing adds up
extremely quickly for example the
company may used 1547 kilograms of gold
in just that timeframe in fact the
amount of gold used by the technology
industry is so massive that it creates
1/3 of the entire global demand for gold
yet at the same time these big
technology industries are not doing
enough to slow the amounts of child
labour and once again like the rain we
have a problem and once again we also
have a solution thankfully smaller
companies are beginning to offer more
ethical alternatives to our phones but
at the moment they&#39;re still not able to
compete on features or price so once
again we have a decision do we choose an
ethically produced phone and a clear
conscience or competitive price tag but
at the moment the decision seems
seemingly clear the more ethical
decision separated from the less ethical
decision but what if I told you that
sometimes it could be more ethical to
make the less ethical decision coming
back to my commute although me deciding
to take the bus instead of the bike put
more pollution into our atmosphere I
also put money into the local economy
improving the quality of lives of the
drivers surely I could just as equally
argue that it&#39;s an ethically sound thing
to do I did some research and on average
we make more than 100 conscious
decisions every day
in fact we make more than a thousand
conscious decisions every day an adult
makes on average 35,000 conscious
decisions every single day of the week
and these decisions gives us a great
power to do good or bad and with that
power we also get the responsibility to
make sure that we feel happy to stand by
after decisions so I&#39;d like to challenge
you to in the next week
at least one of the many thousands of
decisions they&#39;re going to make and
imagine a world where everybody knew why
they took the bike or the bus a world
where we didn&#39;t blindly cause harm to
others
thank you
