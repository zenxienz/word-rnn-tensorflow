Charles Dickens once wrote some magical
words it is the best of times the worst
of times but possibly it was written for
our times when we look around we&#39;ll live
in a world of complete contradictions as
the glaciers and icebergs melt we are
more water but less water to drink we
have more development less equality we
have more colleges less education we
have more opportunities less careers we
have more success less happiness and
when I think about this as an HR
practitioner now for many years meeting
different genre of talent young old in
different industries one of the things
which has always perplexed me is this
entire confusion about what&#39;s a
successful career people talk about
success in careers I have rarely found
people ask about happiness and careers
and you&#39;ve ever had the most successful
career but if you were not happy was it
worth it and given the context of the
world today which is VUCA so volatile so
uncertain traditional career planning is
dead and therefore mighty ceases
individuals today who are wanting to
build careers must design their careers
and what&#39;s a career it&#39;s not just a set
of titles or your bank balance or your
corporate affiliations it&#39;s a lot about
you careers today are more internal than
external careers are about a mosaic of
experiences it is about a set of
experiences you go through which help
you
relevant today and also be relevant
tomorrow to impact today and to impact
tomorrow and therefore couriers are
really about building yourself up
through asset and series of experiences
which tackle more of complexity and more
of uncertainty this I think is very
important for everyone to understand
otherwise we will always remain a
prisoner of a past education or a past
experience none of which is going to be
relevant in the world of tomorrow now if
you want to design your career there are
two concepts that I personally feel are
very useful one is what I call the life
space the other is what I call the work
space life space is all about your
deeply embedded life interests your
passions your interests your hobbies
where do you come alive where do you
draw your module from and workspace is
your operating operating context of
where you actually deliver most of your
time now it&#39;s very interesting that the
two spaces come together in very
different ways for different people the
idol is a perfect Venn diagram but we
know life there is no perfect solution
there is no perfect answer sometimes for
example workaholics life happens to be a
little dot in the life space you you
seek and get your energy from your work
you just need to be alive whereas for
others you need to earn your bread and
butter and therefore it&#39;s a small dot
but you draw your energy your identity
your nourishment from life from things
beyond work or it could be a combination
thereof
the reason I cite this is because life
and careers often are trade-off
decisions if not alignment decisions and
the earth the sooner we are comfortable
with this reality we can design a career
choices more accurately both for success
and for happiness so let&#39;s move forward
and understand how do you therefore
build a career it&#39;s like getting into a
career gym you need to turn all your
career muscles and you know one of the
first things about building your self up
is to get your fundamentals right I
remember a time many years back as a
teenager when I was learning horse
riding
I had a veteran police horseman as my
instructor and unlike my brothers he got
me the worst possible mount she was a
beautiful chestnut mare but she had a
mind of her own she would bolt away when
she was expected to walk she would stand
on a hind legs when there was no
provocation she would jump hedges when
there was no instruction imagine in
those circumstances I asked my
instructor
why is the world so unfair with me why
can&#39;t I also have an easier hostile ride
on and I remember his words so clearly
if you get your fundamentals right and
gripped the horse right with your knees
irrespective of the prop called the
stirrup which actually adds no value
we aren&#39;t comfort you will always be
able to ride any horse anywhere anytime
today I remember those words because
that&#39;s exactly true for careers if we
can get our fundamentals right it
doesn&#39;t matter where you are in which
situation no horse or no situation can
get you off its back it&#39;s equally
important for us to remember that when
you&#39;re in this stage of building muscles
we must stop pause reflect which are the
muscles we&#39;ve not really used which are
the ones being over exercised is their
balance and we normally never stop and
introspect but this is part of jimang
this is part of getting ready and
sometimes it is good to exercise things
that you&#39;ve never really used get out of
your comfort zone
do things which you&#39;ve never done before
and if I go back to my little riding
story every part of the body ached who
when I was learning how to ride at least
for the initial days same happens with
couriers when you&#39;re learning a new
skill when you&#39;re getting out of your
comfort zone doing something that you&#39;ve
never done before it pains you want to
regress but that is where couriers need
to nasa t they need resilience they need
perseverance and you get that right
couriers are bound to happen I also want
to talk about this entire thing about
couriers couriers are not a solo sport
you might be the best at your trade but
it doesn&#39;t guarantee that you will have
a courier which will last you a lifetime
couriers is about taking help help from
friends from teachers instructors
managers bosses peers team members
friends family people who supplement you
in areas that are you&#39;re not naturally
strong in and also you helping others
become more when you help people become
more your career is more insured and in
today&#39;s world your reputation precedes
you may and if you are in that situation
but a positive reputation has preceded a
resume there will be more takers for you
then you would otherwise be typically be
placed for so I think it&#39;s very
important to widen and deepen your
network even as you build your career
because taking help and giving help is a
sign of great careerists and this is a
very important career design principle
very briefly I want to also talk about
accidents that happen in careers some
are happy accidents moments of
serendipity fortuitous events you got to
meet the right people you happen to be
the right person the right role these
things do happen
there the prescription is easy grabbed
the opportunity with both hands you&#39;re a
lucky person if you don&#39;t seize the
moment you have only yourself to blame
but at the same time in the VUCA world
in which we stay I have seen far too
many career derailments for me to ignore
the fact that accidents happen and they
happen when you are cruising along they
happen suddenly because we have not
realised or asked ourselves are some of
the skillsets getting a little jagged is
some behavior getting toxic is something
else which has worked so well possibly
drying up and if we don&#39;t take such
preventative actions accidents do happen
and then accidents happen along the
curve along the bend so I think it&#39;s
very important for us to periodically
make sure that we look at our little
pieces of our career architecture to
make sure they are relevant and you
remember one of the biggest reasons why
accidents happen is when people become
cynical they become eternal critters no
one hires a creeper no one wants to keep
a crib ax if you&#39;re a manager no one
wants to work with a not so sunny
manager and this sound very simple but
couriers are not always as logical they
are not always as obvious as we think
because most derailments happen for
these reasons so it&#39;s very important for
us to remember that like a good safety
principle an accident prevented is
better than an accident treated so
career derailments happen
you can definitely recover maybe you&#39;ll
be laid up for some time you will need
to rewire yourself but if you can
prevent an accident by reinventing
yourself appropriately at different
points in time
that&#39;s a smarter you as I come towards
the close let me remind ourselves not
all of us are equally blessed to have
the same boxes of paint with which we
can paint our careers some have more
variety some may have only a black and
white box
but remember the best sketches sometimes
are black-and-white sketches provided we
know how to use the colors right
similarly when you have a range of
colors what combination of colors really
helps you paint your picture because our
careers finally are owned by us we have
no alibis which as you would to blame
everyone from our parents to teachers to
organizations and managers
the reality is career painting is our
intellectual property and therefore my
appeal to everyone who&#39;s wanted to build
careers and relevant couriers is use
your paint well do it
innovatively do it creatively do it in
the manner that represents you because
ultimately it&#39;s about you it is it must
represent the soul of you it must be
something that actually builds you up
one of the reasons of trying to be a
different painter and trying to clone
your career on the lines of someone else
is dangerous it is dangerous for the
simple reason that these efforts
somewhere average you whereas if you
focus on creating something which is you
leveraging the opportunities that is you
the unique signature strengths that you
have being conscious of what you are not
you will paint a picture which will
multiply you which will maximize you and
when you maximize yourself and you are
in sync with your true self with your
true not with your true purpose I think
that&#39;s the time irrespective of what
series of roles and assignments you did
the experiences you repudiated there are
newer ones that you acquired you would
have finally painted a picture that
would be you
and this to me is fulfillment of a good
career design where you&#39;ve designed your
career not only to be authentic and in
the process be successful and most
important
be a happy one so thank you very much
and wish everyone a great career in
their lives
