I&#39;m excited to be here it&#39;s a privilege
for me and honor to be able to share my
story one more time so let me take you
back to when my story began I was sat
down at home I was studying for my
degree when all of a sudden I
experienced a sharp walking sensation
deep into my hips which literally Kapil
admit involuntarily out of my chair and
stood me up to face the fire my life so
what would you do in a situation like
that I did what most people would do
which was went to my local GP went to a
local therapist and started to follow
the advice that was given three months
went by and I won&#39;t get in any better
and just to give you the context you
know I was unable to sit down after this
and I remember at university they used
to call me the standing man and as you
can imagine not nice and so I became
obsessed with this idea to get myself
better and I started to reach out a
little bit further I worked with some of
the local sports teams therapists and
once again you know six months went by a
year went by and I still wasn&#39;t getting
better I mean by that time I had been
educating myself and I&#39;d started to
reach out further to some some guys in
the States
I had been down to some people down in
London and I started to develop my
understanding of the human body but
despite that I still wasn&#39;t getting
better
and like I see it were taught obsession
so three years in you know I&#39;m getting
sick and tired of this so I&#39;m looking
for a solution and so I got lured into
this idea that surgery would be a quick
fix and let me assure you all today that
that surgery is not a quick fix on any
major joint in the body okay you could
consider myself a bit of an expert
because I&#39;ve actually had five and
actually had four surgeries during a
six-month period and so obviously I hope
you&#39;ve never had a surgery but if you
have you&#39;ll understand you have to go on
under anaesthetic and then when you come
out of the surgery for me if had
my hip done that entire leg is limp and
so for six months I had both hips and
both shoulders done so I pretty much the
cast to capacitate each time I had the
surgery so my life revolved around
having a surgery going back home laying
in bed and then doing exercises and you
know I remember just getting bed sores I
didn&#39;t really he&#39;s familiar with us but
hopefully not but yeah I used to get bed
sores because they were in bed so much
not not a nice time not a nice time
definitely the most challenging time in
my life that I&#39;ve ever had and I
remember just kind of drawing up a
little bit of enthusiasm going back to
my surgeon and saying look you know my
surgeries would beam to success so I
went back to him and I said look you
know went one kind of stat playing sport
when can I start lifting weight when can
I start running again and he said to me
said never ever play sport he said don&#39;t
run and don&#39;t lift weights you know
again and then for me that was just
something that I could not accept and I
wouldn&#39;t accept it and I&#39;m so glad as I
stand here today that I just did not
accept that but that that was the start
of a journey for me I mean guys aren&#39;t
Elise deer really but and you know a
journey that as has taught me some major
lessons in my life and I&#39;d like to share
those lessons with you today through the
use of a little acronym so for me spells
out the key to a better future so first
letter on the acronym thank you
it&#39;s P you have to believe in your
potential so I&#39;ve been told that I would
never be at a place bar again I&#39;ve been
advised not to do that but I still knew
in my heart that could be an athlete
again I knew that I could get myself
going again
and you know for yourself you know only
you know what your potential is and you
know it&#39;s you aster Diggy
to that maybe that&#39;s an area of your
life that you had a goal or a dream and
you&#39;ve kind of shoot yourself off a
little bit and so what I would say he
was pull it back out again you know get
that potential going again because this
is where it all starts
if you don&#39;t believe in your potential
then how can you go where you want to go
that&#39;s the start so next you&#39;ve got e is
for execute and so I had to execute and
you know I still teach there spend you
know time working on my body and a time
out to learn about my body
you know I literally travel the world I
went to Los Angeles I went to Detroit I
went to Washington and like I said
travel down to London and no way was too
far for me to go I used to spend hours
it was just a constant obsession to
learn about my body to get out of pain
obviously pain is a strong driver and
you know it&#39;s not always easy doing that
I realize that just putting one foot in
front of the other
it&#39;s not always easy but that&#39;s where it
starts you have to stop putting one foot
in front of the other and moving towards
your potential
next is relativity so that Li you can
see that as a picture of someone kiss
him yeah so if I said to you today that
I was relatively faithful to my wife
everybody would know what I mean by that
and as it relates to me and my story you
know I could have got four and a half
years into the process I could have
spent thirty five thousand pounds I
could have been spending you know
countless hours and seeing countless
therapists and still I was impaired and
I could have given up them I could have
I could have said well you know look at
this guy
I mean I&#39;m a next-door neighbor he had a
problem with his knee you went to see a
therapist down the road it took him a
few lessons and now he&#39;s knees better
and so that for me and it has nothing to
do with you and what I mean by that is
what the next person is doing has
nothing to do with you
you know the question is and so for me
the question was
am I an athlete yet and the answer was
not and so I had to do what I had to do
until the answer was yes so next is that
search s/s is for search so Jim Ron said
finding is reserved for those at search
and so for me I was searching for what
felt like a lifetime
you know I&#39;d I&#39;d paid this twelve
thousand pound to do a course over in
America and add add about three or four
months into the course you know this was
after a surgery that I were out there we
did some theory indoors and you know
we&#39;re a great cast a great bunch of
people yet atmosphere and a member went
outside to put some of the theory into
practice and I was unable to do the
practical still you know after four and
a half years and and all the money that
I&#39;ve invested and I just remember a bit
of a breaking point for me I mean I can
feel it now I&#39;m talking to you but just
I just felt like a massive ball of you
know her and just like pizza pit is the
word you know I remember just walking
away from the group I couldn&#39;t be around
everyone I had to go and so I walked to
where but thankfully because I was there
and I was searching that&#39;s the key thing
I don&#39;t want to move away from that you
have to search him because I was there
searching I bumped into a guy called
Lenny Pacino who was a therapist and a
facilitator on the course and Lenny was
a was a huge help and you know when I
spoke to Lenny you know he asked me what
I&#39;ve been doing and how I&#39;d been doing
it and he just didn&#39;t seem too impressed
and that were good because neither was i
I still wasn&#39;t where I wanted to be and
so after speaking with Lenny I decided
that I have to put
footing from the other again after go
out to Los Angeles after I spent two
days with Lenny learning how we could
help me as a therapist I was remember
Lennox saying to me see look keV said
this is been going on for like five
years he said I need more than two days
and that that leads me on to my next
point and that is i i i is for invest
you so for me i would have an aggressive
ongoing investment in my future you know
to become an athlete again and so when
Lenny said that to me I was all-in and
so what I mean by that is I made a
decision in my mind that I will go out
to Los Angeles and live there for a
month
get under Lenny&#39;s skin and understand
what I had to share with me and the wall
problem my manager didn&#39;t seem to share
my vision so I went back to a manager I
told him and he said to me I said keV
nice guy said keV if you go it says you
will not have a job to come back to and
so it&#39;s important that everyone realizes
you know I&#39;ve been involved in the
fitness industry for 15 years and I
worked at that actual establishment for
ten years and but ever since Dave Warren
I&#39;ve always knew it was a passion of
mine and you know I just got a lot out
of being on the gym floor you know
working with people as a personal
trainer I was giving a lot out but I was
getting a lot back in lots of other ways
you know and but I looked him in the eye
and I said look I said I&#39;ve got to look
like some real ease and that&#39;s what I
did I went out to Los Angeles and my
next point is s su special death so I
studied Lenny and these the ideas that
he was sharing with me as if my life
depended upon it and quite frankly it
did you know I&#39;m sure Lenny must have
thought had a screw loose because you
know I used to get there an hour early I
used to practice exercises that he told
me and then during the session and
that&#39;s the video record our session then
after the session and practice exercises
that it told me and then I&#39;d go back
home and and what
the video recording because you know I
didn&#39;t want to go and just get a few
exercise off no it&#39;s a really get under
his skin and study studying real deep to
understand how he thought of what they
were thinking and and that&#39;s what I did
you know and I believe that all of us
can do that you know starting today with
we can decide start studying towards our
dreams and our goals whatever they are
and I think you know if if you do
believe in your potential you know when
you start to execute and take action and
you don&#39;t fall into the relativity trap
you know and you search and you invest
in yourself and you study if you do all
that I believe you can finally go on to
tea and they stick what&#39;s yours
let me go back so yeah so I went on to
compete in 18 amateur boxing contests
and I&#39;ve competed in the out of
freestyle wrestling I&#39;ve competed in
jiu-jitsu I mean when I was working hard
with my fitness I were able to run a
mile in like four minutes and 46 seconds
and I say that not to impress you but
just to impress upon you you know from
going to a point where literally my mom
at help they get dressed in the morning
to being a good level as an athlete I
think it&#39;s an indication that if you&#39;ve
persist and if all of us that today you
know if we persist towards our own goals
then finally we can get there and take
what&#39;s ours and in the spirit of TEDx
York let the games begin
