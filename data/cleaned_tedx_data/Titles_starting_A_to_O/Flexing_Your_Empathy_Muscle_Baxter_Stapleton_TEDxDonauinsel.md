we no longer talk to each other we
entertain each other we don&#39;t exchange
ideas we exchange images and we don&#39;t
argue about argue with propositions we
argue with good looks celebrities and
commercials Neil postman robot wrote
about this in his book amusing ourselves
to death in 1985 and I believe that
argument as as relevant today as it was
then I work at the epicenter of
entertainment and I&#39;ve seen firsthand
how we&#39;re amusing ourselves to death and
I believe it&#39;s because we aren&#39;t
connecting we&#39;re hiding and retreating
behind our devices I&#39;ve seen this in the
way we have conversations about like the
refugee situation and also my country
with immigration and police brutality
and black lives matter there&#39;s a loss of
compassion and I believe it&#39;s because
we&#39;ve become deficient or lazy and being
able to strengthen one of our most
important muscles so that&#39;s why today
I&#39;m here before you not just as a
content creator but as your personal
trainer so you may have heard of
ten-minute abs but over the next 10
minutes I&#39;m gonna be activating and
strengthening your other core who you
are your most important core and there
lies your most important muscle your
empathy muscle empathy is the ability to
feel what someone else is feeling and
when you&#39;re empathetic you&#39;re truly
alive because our main purpose is to be
seen and to feel like we belong and
empathy is is what fuels all social
movements and emotional intelligence is
one of the most important skills for
success today and at the heart of
emotional intelligence is your empathy
muscle so let&#39;s give the strengthening
let&#39;s get started so for our first
exercise I&#39;m asking everyone to stand
so well I&#39;m gonna say a word and then
we&#39;re gonna spell it together and then
I&#39;m we&#39;re gonna say that word ten times
and after we say the word I&#39;m gonna ask
you a question and I need you to shout
out the answer to the question so
everyone understand so the word is silk
it&#39;s s I okay let&#39;s say it together silk
s I okay amazing
silk let&#39;s spell it again amazing okay
cool let&#39;s say it 10 times silk silk
silk silk silk silk silk silk silk silk
what do cows drink okay raise your hand
if you save milk I say it to don&#39;t worry
amazing okay well that&#39;s it okay you sit
down thank you so much that&#39;s an example
of a trigger our brain loves triggers
because it allows us to reach answers to
questions with minimal effort but sugars
can lead us to some harmful consequences
because triggers lead to the stereotypes
and if you think about it we can have
triggers that based on people that are
different than us or sound different can
we use to make you harmful decisions so
people in power a lot of times the
reason why they treat people who are
socially similar to have better is
because there are triggers and
stereotypes are firing saying that oh
that person looks like me so they must
be okay versus someone who may be in the
other group but how we can bat triggers
and stereotypes is through stories
stories have the power for us to see
people and things from other another
perspective and stories allow us to get
directly to the source we are
biologically wired for story if you
don&#39;t believe me let&#39;s do our next
exercise put your hand over your heart
okay do you feel a beating
so if we were going to draw out your
heartbeat it looks very similar to the
arc of a story so you have an opening
rising action climax falling action as a
resolution a boom boom boom so we are
actually we&#39;re living a story and when
you hear someone&#39;s story you&#39;re getting
to their heart and you can better
understand their situation we remember
our lives of stories and not as data so
understanding the rules of storytelling
will be able to help us develop better
our empathy muscle in every story the
protagonist or the hero has a clear want
or desire and that&#39;s what allows us to
connect with them and empathize with
them is when we know what their one is
and so I started thinking about my life
as a story and how the people around me
are characters in the story and every
protagonist begins with an inciting
incident a call to adventure where the
the hero is faced with a challenge in a
conflict but they must overcome in order
to begin their adventure so my inciting
incident was in the third grade and I
experienced a blue-eyed brown-eyed
experiment that Jane Elliott created so
we were all classified in our class by
eye color and we&#39;re inferior or superior
solely based on the color of our eyes so
it was blue eyed day and I was sitting
in the back of the classroom I was
pretty upset because we&#39;re watching a
movie and I couldn&#39;t see the movie
because I was in the back but the movie
was about Ruby Bridges and Ruby is a 60
the true story of her is a six year old
black girl who in 1960 was the first to
be integrated into an all-white school
in New Orleans and by the end of the
movie I started tearing up because I
could feel her joy I could feel the joy
she felt when she hugged a white student
and she felt like she belonged but
finally this school is a place where she
can make friends and that was so
powerful for me I wanted everyone to
feel that the same way that I felt
because they allowed me to connect with
something I never met before and
somebody was a very different than I was
yeah I realized that the power that film
had to deliver that message in that
moment my body was activating mirror
neurons if I&#39;m observing you the same
Mir same neurons activating in my brain
is if I&#39;m experiencing that myself
that&#39;s one of the reasons why in
Hollywood I work with a lot of dancers
because dance is such an emotional
experience you can physically your
neurons are activating when you watch
someone move as if you&#39;re doing it
yourself and art has the power to
transform our moral imagination and
shape our worldview when we make the
imaginative effort to set aside the
shoes of another person and see things
from their perspective we become less
capable we become less capable of
ignoring their suffering the media we
consume is essential to our empathy diet
because we imitate what we see I was
riding the car with my mom home from
school and a song came on the radio
people killin people dyin children hurt
and you hear them cryin can you practice
what you preach would you turn the other
cheek father father help us and some
guidance from above people got make up a
questioning where is the love I was like
whoa what is that song and so I never
heard that before and so I was
scribbling down the lyrics as fast as I
could because these are the days before
apps and Shazam so I had to figure it
out and but luckily I was able to find
out the song was where as a love by the
Black Eyed Peas
and that group infuses empathy into
their work so I knew that I wanted to
support them and then I was gonna work
with them one day and at the same time
my 8th grade teacher she created a
capstone assignment so we had to put
together a portfolio of all the work
that we had made that year and also
include works from other artists that
inspired us so naturally after her that
song I included the lyrics to where his
love in my portfolio because it was a
perfect example for me of pop culture
with a conscience
that I want to emulate at my work in the
hero&#39;s journey an important next step
for the protagonist is the meeting of a
mentor so think of obi-wan Kenobi in
Star Wars or Dumbledore and Harry Potter
or Gandalf in Lord of the Rings or
Rafiki in the Lion King so basically the
mentor gives the hero of the supplies
knowledge and confidence required to
overcome her fear and face her to face
her adventure so I know my quest to use
on a spread empathy through media
I needed to enter a new world and find a
mentor so I moved to Hollywood and with
help of some amazing friends I began
working at the future well I am as
creative compound and the future became
my odds it was a place where I was able
to cultivate my skills as a content
creator and developed content that would
impact culture and will will.i.am became
AI Rafiki he was my mentor and so we
were walking down the hallway one
afternoon last July and he was like hey
I&#39;ve been working on a new version of
where&#39;s the love and I think we need to
film the video for it we need to release
it it&#39;s time now I was like whoa all the
dots in my life I was connecting and I
was like I saw that my story was making
sense so a big takeaway for me from the
word is a love project was that empathy
is a contagion and that originally when
we were in the studio the song was just
the Black Eyed Peas was just their own
vocals and it was cool but he was like
something&#39;s missing and so he started
putting out the call to other artists
and luckily Justin Timberlake came back
and it was amazing because as we&#39;re
empathetic and showing people the
project it was it became viral and that
they started coming exponentially so
they became and went from just black
eyed peas to black-eyed peas featuring
the world the challenge is to hook an
audience to gain their attention reward
that attention and then move someone to
act in my experience it&#39;s pretty easy to
entertain someone you can make a cat
video or you can do a lot of different
things but it&#39;s easy to entertain
someone I mean we love cat videos
but but what&#39;s difficult is that you
have to be able to move someone to act
and it&#39;s tough when someone is
empathetically deficient because they&#39;re
not willing to care about someone else&#39;s
feelings so you know if you&#39;ve heard of
the word slacktivism or activist or
collectivism those are terms that
describe that behavior and we have to
move beyond just having people like or
love something that there needs to move
into real life muscles can grow unless
they are strengthened habitually so
consuming media that is inspirational or
empathetic is essential the natural
result of an empathetic heart is to
advocate the rising action is a series
of events where the here prepares for
their big moment so think of like every
montage or they&#39;re like you know pepping
a big fight scene or training and that&#39;s
where we are now in our lives and so now
we need to flex so turn to your neighbor
and say are you ready to flex amazing
amazing I love the community we&#39;re
building this is great okay so we&#39;re
gonna flex we&#39;re gonna flex our empathy
muscle and to do that we need to focus
and observe others listen to understand
expand your circle and experience
someone else&#39;s life so focus and observe
others focused observe others listen to
understand expand your circle and
experience someone else&#39;s life and then
with your last finger I need you to flex
your elbow and plant bang it yourself
because it all begins with you so if you
aren&#39;t willing to make the change
yourself then all this work you&#39;re doing
develop your empathy muscle it won&#39;t
matter so in trust me there are days
when it&#39;s not easy being kind but it&#39;s
the same thing we&#39;re going to the gym we
need to do you know doing bicep curls
for the first time again you&#39;re gonna
get a little tense it&#39;s gonna feel like
you&#39;re gonna get sore it&#39;s gonna hurt
but that means you&#39;re alive
conflict and every story is every hero
needs conflict because without it you
don&#39;t grow so I&#39;ve been reading a lot
about empathy and people say that it&#39;s
draining you know when you have someone
suffering you know it&#39;s gonna just drain
you but in my opinion my life is
transformed because you live a more
empathetic life you become more alive
and trust me when your heart starts
beating more your story gets more
exciting so if you flex a little every
day think of the transformations that
will happen not only in your life your
personal lives but your organization
trust me it&#39;s going to change for the
better
and let&#39;s seek to talk to each other and
not just amuse ourselves and audit your
media consumption is what you&#39;re looking
at helping to strengthen your empathy
and the world will come together when we
truly see one another and that begins by
flexing a little every day
