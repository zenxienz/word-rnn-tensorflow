against they were the question who feels
that the area in which they work or the
area which they will work when they
graduate is becoming increasingly more
competitive for this one but maybe your
wages are not increasing but the
expectations upon you are and there&#39;s
more people fighting for less work ok
quite a lot of hands they&#39;re good you
know I kind of feel that too and well
they sort of sigh huh
and I thought maybe today we would
explore why that might be and what has
happened to the good old days at work
now I&#39;m aware that you&#39;re not really
looking for bad news no one is ever
looking for bad news it&#39;s actually
exactly why they call it bad news so
today there is a little bit of bad news
in my talk and so what I&#39;m going to do
is at any moment and which I say
something negative what I&#39;m also going
to do is show you a few pictures kidding
[Laughter]
I&#39;m hoping that during those moments you
can focus upon the kidney and things
will remain positive so I told this
prophet recently for those of you who
can&#39;t read it it&#39;s a study work dying I
think I got the message from the author
of this graffiti which is that you know
we&#39;re all sheeple you know and all we do
is we just study at the start of our
lives and then we get a job and we just
do that job now without thinking about
it again and again and again until we
die it&#39;s a kind of bleak message that
they were trying to send and when I was
looking at this graffiti and it seemed
to me for a kind of young person at
university this thing almost optimistic
we some come back ok sorry
actually you would just study once at
the beginning of your life you know and
become a kind of something an expert in
self-image and then you would find work
then you would just stay in that work
all of your life you know without having
to retrain and then eventually you would
dying the bad news are getting up
kicking for that and it seemed to me for
that young person our way through the
working world is going to be much more
complicated now it&#39;s probably being
slightly more like this and in which
we&#39;re going to study and then we&#39;re
going to graduate
and we&#39;re going to come out of
university and we&#39;re going to look for a
job and it&#39;s at that point that we&#39;re
going to learn that there aren&#39;t any and
so maybe we have to take whatever job
there is like an unpaid internship and
we have to move back into our parents
basement and if we do that unpaid
internship really really well don&#39;t
reward us with a badly paid internship
and if we do the badly paid internship
really well they&#39;ll reward us with a
badly paid job probably not a permanent
job because there&#39;s no permanent jobs
anymore it&#39;ll be like a temporary job or
a contract job or a project-by-project
job or a fixed number of hours job or
some kind of job that makes it work
really hard until we have a burnout and
then the cycle will just repeat
and then probably again maybe get you
tired of working for other people will
decide that we should work for ourselves
so we&#39;ll try and start up because
everyone else is trying to start up so
why not us maybe we&#39;ll build an app
because everyone else is building an app
why not us we&#39;ll create one of those
really useful apps like a way for people
to share their power or something we
realize that that doesn&#39;t work because
it&#39;s all really like a thousand apps
with people to share their power so
there&#39;s no money in that anymore and so
we&#39;ll go bankrupt and the cycle will
repeat again five six seven maybe ten
times across our working lives and then
when it&#39;s time to retire we&#39;ll learn
that the pension system has collapsed
and essentially no money for us to
retire young people anymore paying into
the pension system for us to take one so
then we realize that basically the only
option left is to die as well as per the
original instructions and we&#39;ll learn
that we actually can&#39;t die because the
singularity has arrived
humans have merged with machines and
we&#39;re now forced to live forever some
pilot matrix hell doing the only job
that still remains which I think will be
kind of optimizing social media
campaigns for a multinational perfume
company and so what has happened to the
world of work how did it get like this I
think in order to understand that we
have to understand that all the
technology is playing in our personal
and work lives a lot of people they see
technology is something exclusively
positive and I wouldn&#39;t make a case
today but that&#39;s not really true I
believe in something called
technological determinism and this says
that we are not taking technology is
technology that is shaping us every new
technology that comes out and forces a
reaction from us we have to decide how
we&#39;re going to incorporate that into our
personal or work lives now this is not
really new in fact humans have had to
react to technology since prehistoric
man discovered fire
what is new however is the speed with
which we&#39;re being asked to do that and
this is because of something called the
law of accelerating returns which says
that
relative technology is being invented
ever more frequently so while it feels
like human progress is linear actually
is growing exponentially and this is
because every new technology it gets to
use all of our existing technologies
whether it&#39;s the shipping container or
the airplane or the internet or Google
or the App Store or Amazon to propagate
itself yeah and so Ray Kurzweil who
coined the term the law of accelerating
returns he says although it will feel
like a hundred a hundred years of
progress in the 21st century in reality
will be something like twenty thousand
years of progress at progresses current
speed and progress is always speeding up
and so any new invention or any new app
or any new piece of software or any new
programming language it can go from
something that no one knows how to use
to something that a few people know how
to use to something that you can make
really good money if you know how to use
to something everyone is simply expected
to know how to use their something any
idiot would do with three clicks of a
mouse to something no one would ever ask
you to do anyway in an ever ever faster
cycle as technology tries to make the
inefficient and efficient and the
complicated simple and the specialized
automated and a commodity and of course
the problem with this is a lot of our
jobs and other things that we&#39;re
studying is to become an expert to do
something complicated and what we&#39;re
seeing now is that the kind of time
horizons for our skills they&#39;re reducing
they&#39;re getting ever smaller and smaller
as new technology is coming in and kind
of making a commodity of this expertise
that we&#39;ve met and so for example a
number of my friends are graphic
designers and I&#39;ve seen how in the past
year they&#39;re kind of all rebranding
themselves now to be a UX designer which
is like someone who specializes a little
bit more in interface design for apps
and they&#39;re doing this because they&#39;re
seeming at the bottom is kind of
dropping out of the graphic design
market because there&#39;s so many like
great templates and graphic libraries
and the software used for graphic design
is getting kind of simpler and simpler
and so the hourly rates are dropping and
so there&#39;s a need to become ever more
specialized to kind of keep it at higher
hourly rate but that doesn&#39;t last for
long of course because that specialized
skill is attractive for new technology
to come in and to commoditize your work
and so the result of this is uncertainty
for us in the job market and they need
to continually get more specialized and
for our employers well they&#39;re suffering
from the same kind of problem they could
have also no longer rely that their
business model will survive the internet
and digital ization and it&#39;s also harder
for them to forecast their needs in
advance and so they begin to employ us
in an ever more temporary way and so
we&#39;re really kind of a race to creating
new jobs as quickly as technology gets
rid of them
obsolete them and sometimes we&#39;re
winning that race and there&#39;s something
like a prosperity for the masses and
other times we&#39;ve kind of fallen behind
this curve of automation and you see the
kind of rising inequality and a kind of
hollowing out of the middle class that&#39;s
been happening for the past ten years or
so and I think the real problem humanity
faces is described kind of beautifully
here but here Wilson and that&#39;s that our
morality tends to move much slower than
our technology and so as he says the
real problem of humanity is that we have
Paleolithic emotions medieval
institutions godlike technology I think
that&#39;s kind of the crux of my of my
argument today is that we kind of have
to be humble about this and work
together as a kind of global society to
minimize the gap between these three
things I hope we&#39;re going to get there
but and we do have some ideas like
around basic income and changing our
models of taxation to kind of keep
things fair or and to share the spoils
of all of this new technology with
everybody not just a few people who are
creating it but in the meantime you know
you&#39;re up you and I as individuals are
kind of going to be left to be
repeatedly kind of swung out by the
sharp edges of the free market and I
have some ideas for how we can future
future-proof our careers as best as
possible the first one that begins with
expenditure so I call it the freedom to
figure the problem that we&#39;re having I
see is that we&#39;ve kind of lost control
of our incomes and so our incomes
fluctuate from month to month depending
on if we&#39;re in work which type of work
we found or if we&#39;re having to take
I&#39;m out - to retrain or to look for work
if you&#39;ve lost control about incomers
it becomes especially important that we
control our expenditure and so all of
the free all the freedom figure asks
from you is that you quantified exactly
to the nearest euro what it costs to be
you so this is mine
we take my fixed costs we have to my
fixed costs my variable costs and you
can see that it costs to be me every
single month 1292 euros and 87 cents
which I guess in Bergen might buy me
like a shack in the woods but in Berlin
or Island it buys me a pretty nice
lifestyle and so and of course the
longer I make that figure the more
flexible my life becomes the easier it
is to hit and there because my aim is to
do that in a way that&#39;s defined
meaningful work
I&#39;m a full-time writer and that&#39;s kind
of unusual in 2017 and I&#39;m often
contacted by other aspiring authors who
will ask me how I&#39;ve managed to do that
and this is of course how I&#39;ve managed
to do that I know that figure and on
average I hit configure most months or
enough months that I can keep being a
full-time writer once you know your
figure once you&#39;ve optimized to figure
once you&#39;ve found a way to hit your
bigger you can be a full time anything
you like you can be a full time I don&#39;t
know astronaut jugular or the cupcake
artisan or whatever you like what we
have to do is know that figure and find
a way to keep that figure and if I got
another Senate for the rest of this year
which in my place is depressingly likely
it&#39;s still going to cost me that okay
what we can do with this model is to try
and completely separate out any comment
from our expenditure you can actually do
that across two different bank accounts
so you can have all of your money coming
into one account then you just transfer
your freedom figure out only a freedom
figure into your current accountant is
from this account that you live each
month and at any time in that month you
can log in you can see how much money is
remaining you can adjust your lifestyle
accordingly and the goal here is to stop
something called lifestyle creep this is
the phenomenon that when you when you&#39;ve
earned more money you spend more money
and you may have experienced this
nodding heads me experience this when
you&#39;ve worked hard you say you know I
deserve a reward until you do something
like outrageously decadent I gather no
use spontaneously fly to Las Vegas and
drink champagne from a distributor
whatever it is I&#39;m not judging you
slightly the result is that you break
even at best for hard work and the
property who&#39;s that you&#39;re not building
up savings for the times that you&#39;re out
of work and it&#39;s going to be a lot of
times going around because we&#39;re going
to spend a lot of time looking for work
and Retraining and so when we&#39;re
learning good money we need to be saving
that money to use later now the only
weird hairy nightmare I have is that I
have to stop doing work that I enjoyed
writing books and go back to doing
corporate work like into the windows it
seems anyway the work that I love and
just do work because I need to pay rent
this month and what I like about this
model is I know exactly when that day is
gonna come and I know that because I can
calculate my life stop burn rate and I
do that by taking the amount of money in
my savings account
dividing me by my freaking figure though
I see exactly how long I have left until
I have to go and get a real job again
and knowing that figure and seeing that
I have a few months or maybe even a few
years saved gives me the confidence to
turn down well paying the boring work
gives me the confidence to take time out
to retrain or gives me the confidence to
go for like a kind of passion project
something that I think is gonna pay off
but it&#39;s probably not gonna pay off in
the short term okay that&#39;s it&#39;s been
ature let&#39;s take a look now at income it
would be greater than that if the world
was a kind of well calibrated machine
and you could pour in hard work and you
could pour in Tallin or what would drop
out of that machine would be kind of
matching Lum of success it would be
great if the world work that way
maybe you&#39;ve noticed it sort of doesn&#39;t
really and that&#39;s why Trump gets to be
President the skill makes me fast in the
Furious movies sometimes the good guys
don&#39;t win and I try to understand why
that is and what you can kind of do
about it you know how you can get ahead
in an unjust world and the answer I find
most often is this supposed to market
yourself which if you do it it&#39;s not
very fun and feels kind of spamming and
seems to involve each will expand doing
business card ping-pong all of this kind
of stuff that just kind of makes you
want to shower there has to be a more
strategic way to think about why why why
and how you can get ahead in an unfair
world and the best explanation I found
for people are able to do that is
something called the luck surface area
and this is coined by an American
reprogrammable Jason Roberts and he says
that when people become aware of your
expertise some percentage of them would
take actually to capture your value but
quite often it&#39;ll be in a way of never
addictive because the world is too weird
and too random for that maybe you&#39;re not
the best judge of what you can offer
that amount so it says you can&#39;t control
more opportunity to get the world is
simply too weird and too random and to
serendipitous but you can control the
number of opportunities that you get now
you do that by thinking about not only
getting really good at something but
also telling the world about it and the
relationship between how often you do
versus how often you tell and so
expressed mathematically your luck
surface area is if you can do well times
by the number of people who know about
the thing you do well and this is for
example why I&#39;ve come here today to do
this talk most of the year I sit alone
in a room wants me to kill myself sorry
I mean writing
mostly writing and of course if I&#39;m
gonna keep getting paperwork I need to
come also out into the world
I can&#39;t just focus on getting rid of
that one thing I have to come out into
the world and tell the world about that
still that&#39;s part of why I do stuff like
this you know I have no idea that was in
this room today and how I could be used
to you that is beyond my control well is
within my control is and then you know
that I exist and I do that by coming
here and showing you pictures of kittens
with the hope that one day we will work
together and you will make me extremely
rich that is it the dream anyway so in
conclusion I think uncertainty is the
new certainty and now whoever gets best
uncertainty wins and so I would say all
you can really do is focus on what&#39;s
within your control which is
understanding your freedom figure
optimizing that figure and trying to
enlarge your like surface area by
focusing not only on doing also about
telling and if you do that I trust that
you&#39;ll find work and you will still have
a promising career good luck out there
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to be great thank
you very much
[Applause]
