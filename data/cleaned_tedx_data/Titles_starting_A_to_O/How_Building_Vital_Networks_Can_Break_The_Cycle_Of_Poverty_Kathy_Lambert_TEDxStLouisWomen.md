so for the past 20 years I&#39;ve been
working with women that have been
struggling with the trappings of poverty
one in three adult women are living in
poverty are on the edge of poverty in
1998 I launched Dress for Success in
Midwest which is many of you know is a
nonprofit that provides professional
attire for women to land jobs so you can
imagine over the years oh the different
women that I&#39;ve met and every all the
stories it&#39;s been incredible women from
homelessness and domestic violence and
women that are coming out of prison but
there&#39;s one woman the sticks out and
that&#39;s the very first woman that I
helped her name was Bridget it was a
cold morning in February never snowing
and I had a call to asked if I would
help a young woman that had a job
interview well I was picking up my very
first donation of suits I was so excited
and I told them you know yes but she had
to meet me at the church parking lot
that&#39;s where I was located so I picked
up the suits I got to the church and I
met Bridget and we popped up in the
trunk of my car and as you would know
there was a suit just her size so we
went inside she put those suit on and
she walked out of the restroom her head
was up her shoulders were back and I
thought she&#39;s confident she looks great
she&#39;s ready to go for that job interview
then I look down at her shoes she had
tennis shoes on I forgot all about shoes
and I thought what are they gonna do she
doesn&#39;t have AI don&#39;t have shoes and all
of a sudden it just blurted out of my
mouth and I said what size shoes do you
wear
like I was really gonna do something
about the shoes right and she said I
wore she wore size six which is my size
shoes city shoes I just got those shoes
they were Nine West red patent I loved
those shoes so I had this dilemma going
on
give her your shoes no give her your
shoes no and they felt like it went on
forever and I&#39;m kneeling down
I gave Bridget my shoes and they fit
when she turned she turned to the side
and she was looking in the mirror and
she had tears coming down and I asked if
she was okay and she said yes and as she
was walking towards the mirror she had
her hand out and she told me she said
you know what I&#39;ve never seen myself
look like this I have to touch the
mirror to make sure that&#39;s me Bridget
got in her car she drove away feeling
that confidence that she&#39;s never felt
before it was a real Cinderella moment
but you know what instead of a prince
saving her she saved herself two hours
later this is the best part two hours
later my phone rang it was Bridget she
landed her job it&#39;s great so
fast-forward just like a little over a
year I received a call from the
Department of Corrections asking if I
would work with them with women that
were transitioning out of prison so I&#39;m
thinking I don&#39;t know anything about
women coming out of prison but I said I
would but I would like to go inside and
talk to the women so they made that
possible so as I was walking inside and
I remember thinking yeah I&#39;m not gonna
be in there long these women are tough
they&#39;re hard they&#39;re heartless what
they&#39;re not gonna want to talk to me do
they need a suit I couldn&#39;t have been
more wrong the women began to share with
me their dreams and what they wanted to
do and how they want
to go to school and get their education
and the jobs they wanted to have and
some even wanted to start their own
business and then they began to talk
about their children and how their
children they didn&#39;t want them to repeat
the same cycle of poverty and then being
in prison but they didn&#39;t know what to
do they didn&#39;t have a plan they didn&#39;t
have connections so after I left and I
was walking out I thought what do they
do well I learned that a lot of women
coming out of prison will go to a
halfway house so I contacted the local
halfway house and I asked the director
if I could meet with her so I did she
explained to me that many of the women
when they come there they come in their
prison uniform they have to get a job in
two weeks within 72 hours they have to
see their probation officer and get this
they have to take a bus so I sat there
all amazed and I just was overwhelmed
because I was thinking about the women
that I just left many of them had been
in there a long time and our world
changes so I asked her I said how do
they do this this is what she said 85%
of the women asked me to send them back
to prison that went straight to my heart
and I kept thinking how would anybody
want to go back to prison and so what I
did is I that I started going inside and
I started going inside and working with
women and helping them as they
transitioned out and I met a young woman
Maria Maria was released to East st.
Louis upon her release she had no home
no money no support system but she had
four children that were in foster care
and were immediately given back into her
custody so I got some friends volunteers
to
we helped her to get into a hotel and
then into a home her children into
school and Maria a job that was in 2001
today he is doing fantastic she was
doing so great and all four of her
children have graduated from high school
they&#39;ve gone to college and Maria has
put herself through college she also has
advanced all the way up into an upper
level management position and she has
broken that cycle of poverty and
incarceration not only for herself but
for her children which is huge but as I
was watching and seeing the women that
were coming through Dress for Success
and over the years we&#39;ve served over
25,000 women and the scene the women
comes through I noticed something and I
learned something from Maria they would
come through they would lay on their job
few months later they would come back
around again and I would ask them I
thought you had a job they said yeah but
I got a raise my world a race was good
right they explained to me for example
today a single mom with one child making
$11 an hour receives welfare benefits
for assistance with transportation
helped to pay the rent and childcare we
like to call them work supports if she
receives 25 cents more look what happens
it stops could you pay before your
child&#39;s care alone at eleven dollars and
25 cents an hour plus transportation and
your rent so I started thinking about
this and I thought what what wage what
hourly wage would a single mom with one
child have to make
today and in this region it would be
around $21 an hour just to pay for her
basic necessities the system our system
is set up my view to create generations
of poverty generations that are
dependent versus independent and for
people to live out the dreams that they
have so I really started thinking how do
we bridge this gap from that $11 an hour
to the 21 the $11 an hour you see it&#39;s
on that cliff right that 25 cent raise
they fall off the cliff so I knew they
needed more than professional attire
what is it that they need career
advancement training education as
sometimes you have to work a second job
but you know what house I learned it&#39;s
right here in this room they needed
connections they needed to have but you
all have what I have think about how
today and with your job how did you get
into your job or your business through a
network right there&#39;s somebody you knew
that helped you you had a connection the
women that walk through our doors have
no network
they have no nets so think about the
networking events that you&#39;ve been to
probably this week and you you know
today is a great example of a networking
event right so would you go and
sometimes I know we dragged ourselves
there we drink the warm Chablis right we
have to balance our purse then we have
food on our plate that we have to shake
a hand and then we talk to people that
we really don&#39;t know and sometimes it&#39;s
worth it sometimes we wonder if it is
but what if
no one wanted to talk to you ever I
thought about that I thought about the
women that we&#39;re walking through her
horse I thought about the maria&#39;s and
the Bridget and I kept thinking about
them so I started a professional women&#39;s
networking group and thinking about how
we network and you know it is awkward
for us right but we do it and we get by
does so many of the women didn&#39;t know
how to give eye contact how do you shake
a hand how do you present yourself and
then how do you start a conversation so
we would practice all of these things
together and then I thought let&#39;s go on
a field trip so I would seek out other
networking events and we would take the
women I would take them and we would go
and it was so fun I would watch them
mingle and talk and at the end of the
evening they were so excited there was
excited to share how they connected with
other women and how some of you maybe
even were connected with jobs but the
biggest thing is they learned the power
of networking of being connected to
other women it was amazing you know we
put a lot of pressure on women we asked
them to rise up stand up do it all on
your own
the fact is none of us would be here
today right on our own none of us can do
this thing called life on our own we
need each other so we can and should
support the progress of all women and be
supportive but especially those that are
on that edge of poverty you see right
here in this room all of you right here
you&#39;re the rising tide and you know what
you can lift all boats
this is really personal to me not
because I launched the nonprofit and not
because of the work I do
but because 32 years ago when I was 26 I
picked myself up off the floor I walked
out of a bad marriage I walked out the
door with the clothes on my back five
dollars in my pocket I was homeless I
was afraid I was embarrassed I was so
scared you see it was a time no-one ever
talked about leaving and there weren&#39;t
any shelters for women but I was a lucky
one because of my other packet I had a
piece of paper that through a friend of
a friend of a friend of a friend gave me
the name of a person and number and said
if I ever needed anything to call so
when I left I went to a phone booth I
called that number and Rachel answered
the phone when she heard my voice she
heard me she said come so I did I went
and she opened up her home to me I slept
on her couch I hate her food she gave me
hope and within a few weeks I had a job
interview and I didn&#39;t have anything to
wear but I had my five dollars so I went
to the local thrift store and I remember
so vividly even today I bought this grey
skirt this turquoise button-up sweater
and black pumps and I was ready to go
for my job interview and you know what I
did and I landed my job as a
receptionist
I started my life over and I started it
over because of Rachel being there and
being connected so my wish for all of
you today my wish for all of you is to
remember the women that may be right
next to you and to remember them and to
reach out to them and also that remember
that no one person can break that cycle
of poverty but you know weds together oh
yeah together we can be that rising tide
and we can it&#39;s up to us thank you
