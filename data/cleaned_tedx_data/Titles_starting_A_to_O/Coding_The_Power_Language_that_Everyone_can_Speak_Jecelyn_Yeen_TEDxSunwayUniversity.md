[Applause]
all right so um the title of my talk is
coding the powerful language that
everyone of us can speak
so before I start talking about coding
language let&#39;s talk about the history of
human language so since thousand years
ago we human have invented something
called language to talk to each other to
communicate then since then the language
actually changed and evolving and
updated too according to the society
needs for example during the NHL&#39;s time
there&#39;s not you in the words code TV but
now we have yeah since then it&#39;s evolved
until the modern English Tamil on what
the modern language that we are speaking
now right how about coding language
since when we have something called
coding that I have a language called
coding it&#39;s in the years of 1843 that&#39;s
the first time where someone someone
said it out someone write a coding
program that&#39;s runs a coding then it&#39;s
not very it&#39;s not rich famous like
everyone of us know something like
coding since years 1957 it&#39;s the same
year as Malaysia independently by the
way so there&#39;s the first popular modern
coding language that introduce is called
Fortran and this language is still using
in some of tikrit mission-critical
applications nowadays and then within
just 60 years we have about 100 plus
language new languages that introduced
that we can use nowadays all right so
why why do I tell you like coding
language if it&#39;s appear that it&#39;s quite
important in our life so I&#39;m less know
attached together so that you know so we
know how that coding is impacting our
life I mean I have everyone stand up
just please stand up
I come to this light too fast yeah so I
will ask you a series of questions if
the questions if your answer to the
question is yes please remain standing
if your answer to the question is no
please take a seat then the remaining
questions will be directed to those who
are still standing
so this is my first question can you
leave a single day without computer
smartphone tablet and TV which means you
can just YouTube to watch unis unis unis
songs you can browse the internet your
Instagram your your water or we can if
the question if your answer is yes
please remain standing if your answer is
no please take a seat
please be honest yourself alright not
bad because I asked this question a few
times and everyone is sick now because
we do rehearse all right so most of you
can still survive with just one day so
here&#39;s my next question can you live
without transport for week by transport
I mean your car&#39;s your bus RIT or
flights your ferry or anything for weeks
you still have your leg you can walk I
will you still if you have a bicycle no
all right
you can still cycling if yes please
remain standing is if no then you please
take a seat
all right
so you have quite a few all right so
that&#39;s creating quite a few people to
stand up if I kept to yourself because
right now I think I&#39;ve probably already
stood now because I&#39;m an internet based
person I can&#39;t really live without
internet so why do I ask this question
and how is related to coding and in the
16 years that mentioned just now all
right so since the first this is my last
before last my last questions please
still remain standing because I missed
explain a little bit yeah since the
first approach the first popular modern
programming language introduced until
today we have gone through quite quite a
bit of thing so I separate that to four
eras the first one is something we call
treaty Ciera which we already have
computer but not computation if a
business per person is so big and it&#39;s
bulky then we have the PC era which we
have our personal computer we can buy
for our home usage you have software
like Microsoft Office and stuff
then during 1990s we have something
called internet and Wi-Fi and now
everyone like most of you that could sit
down cannot survive without Wi-Fi
internet and since then we have Facebook
YouTube and Google and we are still
using that for now then we have our
smartphone era in ten years ago is just
10 years now everyone we have my smart
phone and mobile phone
in your in your hand and you have a pre
software application like Instagram
snapchat and you will and others and
achieving our life&#39;s convenient so what
is it later to coding pencil if there&#39;s
no cording then they might not have
computers there&#39;s no program to run and
there might be no software because
software is written with coding language
let&#39;s make it even worse look at
something around you and probably
something a traffic single as a traffic
light or the washing machine that you
have at your home without coding and I
wouldn&#39;t say that because I feel it
equates not exactly core probably we
still have technology and wise women but
it&#39;s not that fast because if without
coding right there&#39;s no program that
tell your washing machine to wash your
clothes the washing is just a bunch of
wire and metal that do not do and do not
do any things so here come my last
question so of you can you live in a
world without coding it&#39;s no please take
a seat if yes please to standing without
yeah
so for those who for those I think I
think about 90% is it also for those who
you still spend we can talk later
thanks thank you this is my last
question yeah so I think now you are
clear that the impact of coding in our
life most of us live with with the thing
the products of code but what exactly is
coding when we talk about coding right
this is the most common explanation that
you find so codings is something like
talking it&#39;s just that we humans talk to
a computer so the computer can
understand different language just like
just now she introduced me we have C
sharp JavaScript and Python and many
more programming languages went human
coding we need to give a set of very
precise instructions to the computer to
tell it what do you expect to do for
example if I want to print and hello the
words hello on the screen and then do
some animation I will need to give
exactly like this print hello
and then jjigae for two seconds only two
seconds then the computer will take my
instructions my program the code that I
wrote run it process it run it and then
display the hello in in the computer so
because when people imagine someone is
coding right we always say that someone
is sitting now looking at the computer
and then probably with respect and you
start today
yeah so yes that&#39;s true that&#39;s when we
really writing the code but coding is
actually more than this why do I say
it&#39;s more than that let&#39;s compare coding
with public speaking so when you go for
public speaking right you need a title
because in here title to talk right then
you need to do some research on the
topic that you want to talk about after
that you need to structure your content
how to open a how to close your cunt how
to close your talk
then you start writing the script
writing how you want to do the tops then
do a lot of rehearsal then finally stand
and speak so this is pretty much the
process in f√°tima same as when we do
coding before we start coding we need
- no ways the problem that we are trying
to solve something like your uber your
grab car apps is so I try to solve the
problem when you killing and a taxi then
you try to Rick now and find the right
solutions for the problem now
then we structure program now how do we
expect the system to work then only we
write the code well you did it try to
test a few law and order use cases then
run the program so what I wanted what
was my point here is that writing code
is just part of the process of coding
and you need a lot of thinking planning
and analytic when you write coding so
codings Scotties actually have fun
things to do and i would like to
challenge you
probably why how about that you start
coding because this guy says oh it&#39;s not
just me these guys don&#39;t say that don&#39;t
just play on your phone from ram it why
do you need to program it because you
already have a very powerful tools in
your hand your phone and your laptop and
it can actually do something like tons
of nothing into something i would like
to share a few few a few reasons on why
me and a few friends of mine we learn
coding and please thing know that some
of my friend is not working as a
software engineer programmer it&#39;s just
working as from the accountant but they
know how to write coding they learn it
and why do they like it
so the first questions is to have funds
and build things so probably some of you
might not going through this era this is
the area where it&#39;s free Facebook era we
have MySpace and with my spam you can
write some very simple code to actually
turn all pitch in to win bling like
victory and because I want to show off
right so I I try to learn some
programming how to make my pitch look
bling-bling and that&#39;s one of the first
program that I wrote now I look back
it&#39;s quite ugly yeah we that&#39;s why
that&#39;s why there&#39;s no such features in
Facebook but I really have funds of
we&#39;ve caught and then tried to write
something and do something out it&#39;s
actually quite happy during that time
and this is a sample of a 500 ring it
works clock so what&#39;s up my friend she
went to Singapore and he saw this clock
and she really likes it but the price
tag actually shocked him so he was
thinking like probably I I can make one
myself then he tried to go any yeah just
friends is actually a frame it you don&#39;t
know he don&#39;t know everything he don&#39;t
know everything about microcontroller or
coding or stuff but he know a little bit
of coding but he don&#39;t know everything
that&#39;s the wiring or stuff but this is
the problem that she wants us off so he
go and do all the research and then why
are we in coding to make it happen hands
up this is tearing it version of the
things but he actually if we haven&#39;t we
haven&#39;t put in the price forces
therefore this takes a few weeks but she
definitely feel happy and to achieve
with this yeah so the next one I&#39;m
learning coding you can be lazy and
productive why do I say so now this is
the news proverb actually write a script
to automate script also it&#39;s a program
that written by code to automate some of
the thing in this life for example one
of the thing he auto me dearest worries
if by night 30 he haven&#39;t checked into
the heaven locked into the office
computer
please automatically send an email to
the boss say I&#39;m sick I&#39;m on MC and this
and he named the script hangover and
yeah and it&#39;s not a bunch of very
interesting thing you can go and staff
this and see what other thing that he
tried to Atami so he&#39;s be lazy but at
the same time is quite productive ax
alright then if the first two reason is
too personal for you but is too small
for you the last one is actually
something big is to change the world to
changing the world it can be something
like a TM machine so again we say
actually changing our our ways of
withdrawing money imagine that you need
to go to the bank chew up an inroad
withdraw the money and spend a few hours
there now you don&#39;t need
and then we have online banking now or
something like um something like oh
right healing right healing apps like
uber and uber and grabs you sketchily I
made our life easier we don&#39;t need to
stand another Sun and then put our hand
up to call the taxi or changing the
world can be something as small as an
alum club the other the alum application
in my phone now is actually really
changing my life so that then get fired
by my boss because I can always go yeah
and changes life it&#39;s also about hitting
others life for example YouTube it&#39;s
easy right YouTube that you need if we
don&#39;t you do there&#39;s no place for her to
publish the thing to show to you oh yeah
so if you know how to code and you know
how to solve a problem then you can you
can try to utilize these tools to do
whatever things that you want to do so
um so they are trying to test where they
are people talking to me like I know
coding is cool because everyone say that
I should learn coding by I think coding
is not for me it&#39;s not a thing it&#39;s not
a thing that I can do so here I would
like to address some of the myths they
often hurt people
there&#39;s people often tell me some one of
the thing is I need to be good in size
and maths so if I&#39;m not good in size a
mess I don&#39;t need I couldn&#39;t code that&#39;s
true if you are building a rocket
seriously if you have a rocket it so
many calculation right so that you don&#39;t
kill someone life right so you need a
heavy calculation if you are doing
statistics really related application
then yes you need that but imagine
you&#39;re building a simple calculator apps
or online dating app from the lights
Hinda how much mathematic or size do you
need to have for the calculator yes you
need to know how to add or how to - and
how to multiply right yes you need to
know math but it&#39;s not that difficult
and most of us know right then for all
night a ting F is even T then you need
to know how to how to do the animations
yeah okay so some of them is then other
methods because the coding is for
program only if my emissions is not to
become a programmer I there&#39;s no point
me to learn coding and I want to tell
you that coding is like drawing it&#39;s for
everyone it&#39;s everyone today because
Cody is not just typing code it gives
you a new perspective knowing that what
is impossible but with coding you can
turn it to possible so and I want to
tell you something that our neighbor
country president mr. lee seon-woo he
know how to code and because Cody is
also problem solving like so probably he
can run the country&#39;s I didn&#39;t say
anything about country okay right so the
last one if some of you town Mira in the
room tell me I&#39;m too old to code I&#39;m
really like seriously because most of
you are younger than me so there&#39;s this
ladies it&#39;s a now 82 years of your
thesis last year new she learn coding at
the age of 81 she bought her first
computer at the age of 60 she she ran a
program like this is the traditional
Japanese girls a program that she caught
herself she taught herself code and she
come home up with this so this never too
late to start coding right so all the
mystic bustard how about like how how
can I start now the question for me I
have convinced you right so how can I
start turns out to start it&#39;s exactly
what I&#39;ve mentioned earlier try to find
a problem that you&#39;re trying to solve
then only Phi the rights to likes coding
hist coding language that can help you
to achieve that so some of the problem
that you this is some ideas for your
problem you can try to do a website for
you yourself or your school clubs or
something or you can try to give a
simple game games or try to build
something like a melon dispenser this is
something credible or probably try to do
something like tell me the time story
Alexa later on we were first store we
have a talk about smart home right right
so these are some of the ideas that you
can kick-start
and you probably no need to do it alone
you can find friends or join a community
to start together to learn together
there are sometimes if you feel lonely
like from you stuck
you have no one to us right you can
always there in Malaysia there&#39;s quite a
few coding communities that you can join
and learning to code is a journey it&#39;s
not something that I can learn in one
day they are quite a lot of marketing
marketing not much they are marketing
Russia they tell you that zero to zero
in one day there&#39;s no such there&#39;s no
such thing I would say because in one
day you can learn the syntax you can
memorize the syntax but you never really
understand the coding process so you
need to understand that yeah I would
like to end my talk with a very famous
quote by Picasso learn the rules like a
pro so you can break them like an artist
so learn the coding and the syntax like
a product and try to try to find a way
to solve your problems of the world
problem and the next 16 years can be
your some light some can be something
like you do and change the world thank
you
[Applause]
