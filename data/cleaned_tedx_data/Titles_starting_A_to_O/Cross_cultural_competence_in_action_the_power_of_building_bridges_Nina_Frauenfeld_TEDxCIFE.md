in my life I heard a thousand times one
doesn&#39;t do that one has to do that one
knows you&#39;re totally capable of doing
that have you heard that as well maybe
from early childhood onwards the one
does one doesn&#39;t is probably the reason
I&#39;m talking to you today as a child at
the age of six I was lying in bed
thinking about this one
wondering why it was a one and not an i
or a you like I don&#39;t want you people to
be mean to your sister or you don&#39;t be
mean to your sister instead of one isn&#39;t
me to one&#39;s sister
I was thinking and trying to understand
where this one does one doesn&#39;t behavior
was coming from and it took me many
nights until I came to the conclusion
that the one does one doesn&#39;t behavior
it&#39;s an indicator of pushing
responsibility away from you pushing it
to a third person pushing it to someone
who is distanced from here pushing it to
someone or even something that holds the
overall generalized collective opinion
on how one has to behave in order to be
normal when I realized that that one
does one doesn&#39;t behavior is an
indicator of pushing responsibility away
from you my thinking became more
adventurous I did allow myself to break
habits to reinvent myself to think
outside the box to lose respect
basically my bedroom turned
to a space of pushing through barriers
sometimes I was jumping with joy because
I found ways out of the narrowness
sometimes I was turning in labyrinth
circles not going anywhere my first step
out was the conviction that there are
many ways of doing things of course
there are I will never forget
Johnny Johnny joined us when I was in
third grade primary school he fled
Yugoslavia with his mother and his
siblings I got invited to Johnny&#39;s
birthday party and the mother who didn&#39;t
have any money decided that the birthday
attraction for Johnny&#39;s birthday was
attending the blasting of an industrial
chimney in my home village in western
Germany it was so fundamentally
different to what I have experienced
before and afterwards but I saw that
Johnny&#39;s mother really wanted to have a
party for her boy and what Johnny&#39;s
mother did with no funds was creating an
unfocused
childhood memory so life taught me that
there are many ways of doing things and
that brought me to my second conviction
that the diversity of approaches is a
good thing
so far my life has been written in a way
that anybody who threatens this one does
one doesn&#39;t status quo it&#39;s an enemy but
really isn&#39;t it ever so boring and moldy
to only have one way of doing things of
course it is isn&#39;t it ever so egocentric
isn&#39;t it
not putting interest in different people
in different approaches I think it is
and this is why I decided to become an
ambassador for diversity
when I became an ambassador for
diversity living in a multicultural
environment I decided to first focus on
cross cultural competences cross
cultural competences being in a position
where you can celebrate differences and
you can celebrate similarities at the
same time I moved from Germany to France
but before that I spent my corporate
working life in the Europe Middle East
and Africa headquarter of a large
American software company where they had
the opportunity to experience embracing
differences and celebrating similarities
on a daily basis I learned it sometimes
the hard way or now how to do that when
I&#39;m thinking of embracing differences in
the celebrating similarities if you ask
yourself what is that basically it&#39;s a
behavior and that behavior has to enable
three things tearing down walls creating
bridges and making us all want to cross
the bridge together and I give you a
hint
there are many ways of doing that so how
do I tear down walls basically it&#39;s that
kind of loop I observe I listen I feel I
understand or I don&#39;t understand I ask
and eventually I understand after I have
circle that loop multiple times I can
literally put myself into the shoes of
the other person and then I ask us what
if we are looking at we would be looking
at it from a different perspective what
if we would feel about it in a different
way
I&#39;m doing that in a non-attacking way I
try to enrich ourselves through
different perspectives by then the wall
is down and they&#39;re spaced to create
something new to create a bridge between
people as a child I&#39;ve been visiting
eastern Germany multiple times I will
never forget the sound our car made when
we were driving on the transit highway
and I will never forget the smell of
brown coal one evening we were staying
with my father&#39;s aunt the parents went
for dinner when suddenly someone was
knocking on the shutter of the window
tanta Mitzi said quick go hide behind
the sofa they must have found out that
we are having contact with people from
the West we were hiding behind it so the
sofa my head was beating my borderless
fantasy went wild went on to meet she
went to the door opened the door she
welcomed some friends who couldn&#39;t find
the doorbell so it was not a dangerous
situation at all but the fear I felt was
real
a bridge has to be built from two sides
sometimes the paths of the bridge don&#39;t
instantly meet in the middle then we
have to go back and try again
so that they finally can meet when with
two parts of the bridge meet people are
happy they are relieved they are
thrilled and they&#39;re very much enjoying
crossing the bridge together which is
the greatest part and a logical
subsequence of having built that bridge
together I believe the the big majority
of people is more interested in tearing
down walls and creating this you might
think oh that&#39;s all very nice in theory
close your eyes close your eyes and
think a moment about the ecstatic
emotions when the Berlin Wall came down
I remember my father crying my meets all
these pictures on television you can
open your eyes again it is part of life
that we are hitting balls but most often
we have the choice to decide if we want
to tear the wall down and if we want to
create the bridge when I&#39;m working with
people from all walks of life and from
all across the world I have been in the
position in the lucky position to have
witnessed falling down wars a thousand
times a day the energy set free when
this happens it&#39;s contagious and it is
addictive once you have started you want
to have more of it and why is that
because it makes you feel meaningful you
need of togetherness is instantly filled
basically you set a prisoner free and
you realize that this prisoner was you
as Lewis B Smith&#39;s so wisely said and
who demonstrated that in more essence
then Nelson Mandela the biggest
ambassador of tearing down walls and
building bridges if you are into rugby
you might remember the 1995 Rugby World
Cup where Nelson Mandela put on his
green rugby the the green rugby shirt
from the Springboks and handed over the
web Ellis cup to the right to the
captain Francois Pina by doing so he was
living up to the slogan of the of the
tournament one team one nation until
then rugby was a sport being played by
white men by putting on the Springbok
rugby shirt and by handing over and
supporting the team Nelson Mandela has
torn down the wall and and killed the
last remains of apartheid and he built a
bridge some 20 years later my sons are
playing football in the fields of Changi
on the wild coast of South Africa if
this is possible for me and the people
I&#39;m working with it must be possible for
a year I actually assume you are already
doing it but I&#39;m here to advertise to
use this behavior on an exponential
level I think that this behavior can
only bloom if we commit ourselves to the
attitude of humanity I&#39;m not here to
talk about the attitude of humanity just
let me give you some of the ingredients
which I think are very fundamental
respect acceptance of differences belief
in diversity but most importantly taking
responsibility for your own behavior
I would neither be German no an academic
to bring in some stereotypes if I
wouldn&#39;t bring in the yes but yes there
are limits of what you can respect and
yes there are limits in your acceptance
of differences and yes there are limits
in your belief in diversity but there
are no limits in taking responsibility
for your own behavior let me give you an
example
once I work with students who studied in
a master of in maths and advanced
European and international studies the
students were already together for three
months in Istanbul before they came here
to nice where I met them for the first
time and we were conducting a workshop
together in the beginning of the
workshop I asked the students to share
an example of a cross-cultural situation
they have experienced everybody had a
story to tell but one student in
particular she stood up when she was
giving her example she was talking
brilliantly she was like talking like
giving a speech like talking to
Parliament the example she shared was an
example that she experienced in the
group of students she was presented to
when she finished her example the other
students applauded her with respect
she told me that she hasn&#39;t spoken in
front of the group for the past three
months that she ever felt so lonely that
she didn&#39;t feel the foundation of trust
given with cultural differences but
today in the workshop she jumped she
said who she walks
she set herself as a prisoner free
she created a bridge which the others
instantly crossed by uploading her with
respect and that changed her world if we
manage to do this in the little circle
we are living in as students in our
family with our friends in the workplace
we are having an impact on how migrating
people are being seen and how they feel
it is on us to take a responsibility for
our own behavior and be a champion in
tearing down walls and creating bridges
it is a shift that happens and starts
first within ourselves and it is our
obligation to be as contagious as we can
be I invite you to join this movement of
transition from balls to bridges in
order to make this world a better place
in which we can all across cultures can
live on planet Earth together with
billions of bitch thank you
you
