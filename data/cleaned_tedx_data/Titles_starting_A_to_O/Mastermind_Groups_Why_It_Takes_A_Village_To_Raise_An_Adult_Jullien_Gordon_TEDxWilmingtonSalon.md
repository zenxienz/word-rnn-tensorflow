so we&#39;ve all heard the quote it takes a
village to raise a child but I believe
that it takes an equally strong village
to raise an adult and today I want to
talk to you about the power of
mastermind groups I&#39;m going to open up
this talk with the talk or motto that I
use to open up my mastermind groups and
it goes as follows in this room is the
power to change the world and me is the
power to change the world if I&#39;m going
to change the world I need a world of
change in me change comes naturally but
it can also come intentionally until the
power of goal-setting and community I
can achieve anything I put my mind to
everything is possible to the extent I
believe it is and I want to dream wide
awake as much as I do asleep and through
focus action we can do it 30 days at a
time this is the life dependency curve
it goes from full dependency to
independence from birth to death and
when we come into this world there are
people to clean up our poop and on our
way out there are people to clean up our
poop and so as we navigate life we
actually have community when we&#39;re born
community organically forms around a
child and then on our way out community
tends to form again in terms of
retirement communities this being one of
my favorite of all times and so we go on
this journey from birth to adulthood and
we become more and more independent we
start tying our own shoes letting
ourself into the house we just start
driving a car we might go away for
college then we get a job more
professional and adulthood is synonymous
with being independent being able to
take care of yourself
but my experience of adulthood has been
a little bit different I&#39;ve actually
experienced that adulthood is the place
in our life where we need the most
dependence on others and this is what I
call the valley of adulthood
in this valley is when my parents got
divorced in this valley is when I almost
got divorced in this valley is where
I&#39;ve seen people I love and care about
experience depression be overwhelmed by
debt experience downsizing or diagnosis
and even death in fact my wife has lost
4 family members in the past 4 months
nobody teaches you how to bury your
parents nobody teaches you how to remove
the fog of depression yet because we&#39;re
adults people assume that we&#39;re just
going to be able to figure it out and
it&#39;s in this valley that we actually
need the most help this is my wife and I
on our wedding day
it&#39;s a beautiful day in a beautiful
picture and she looks absolutely amazing
but despite how much we loved each other
and how smart we both were we came to a
point in our relationship where we hit
this rough patch and she nor I could
figure out what was causing it it wasn&#39;t
a particularly
but something had changed and we were
stuck we were at a stalemate and we
realized that the thinking that a God
has to marriage wasn&#39;t going to be
enough to get us through marriage in
adulthood I had also somebody who I love
and care for deeply experienced
alcoholism and as they were on their
road to recovery they kept telling me
about this organization
a-a-a a-a-a-a and it was in this valley
that I thought friends and family would
be the ones who came through for you but
instead it was a group of strangers who
had become their friend and family and I
got very intrigued and so I went to an
open Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with a
friend and I walked into that room and I
saw the most diverse community I ever
seen people of all ages all cultures all
socio-economic classes supporting each
other towards one goal which was to stay
sober I left that meeting and I turned
to my friend and I said I want this but
in that same breath I recognized that I
couldn&#39;t have it because I was not an
alcoholic and that sent me on a journey
to try
to create a community that wasn&#39;t based
on addiction or depression but a
community that was based on people&#39;s
aspirations and dreams so I went to look
for Alcoholics Anonymous secret sauce so
I could apply it to what I wanted to
create and as I was doing my research I
came across this research from 2002
where they did research into show that
people who went to formal treatment
alone only had a 25.9% 3-year after this
rate but people who went to formal
treatment and AAA had a 50.9% 3-year
abstinence rate so participation in a a
going to meetings actually doubled
people&#39;s Astin his rates and here I had
found the secret sauce
it was the collective accountability in
the community the other thing I love
about AAA is that beyond just being in
100 120 thousand groups all across the
world with serving over 2 million people
a week is its first step and its first
step is really all about
admitting that there is a problem and
that life has become unmanageable yet we
as adults are taught to project as if we
have it all figured out and the humble
words of Kanye West
you can&#39;t tell me nothing and we have
all this programming as we mature of
every man for himself
survival of the fittest it&#39;s me against
the world if it&#39;s gonna be it&#39;s up to me
if you want something done do it
yourself and my favorite of all time
pick yourself up by your own bootstraps
raise your hand if you&#39;ve made
bootstraps before so the quote in it of
itself about self-reliance suggests that
we actually need somebody else to help
and so this is programming that we get
embedded into us from when we are young
and so we get into situations that are
in the valley we call for one one for
more information instead of calling 911
for direct help from other people we go
to Google we ask Siri Siri how do I bury
my parents Siri how do I get through
this fog or depression Siri can&#39;t answer
those questions see I found that the
most powerful three words in the English
language are not I love you there
actually I don&#39;t know none of us all
have it figured out if we all had it
figured out we&#39;d already have everything
that we want and desire and there&#39;s room
for growth and so when we look at our
education and we had to figure out how
do I know I need help we looked at our
grades well in adulthood there aren&#39;t
grades we have the different areas of
life from personal social family health
spiritual financial and if you honestly
had to grade yourself in every domain of
your life what would your life GPA be
most of us we would not have a 4.0 and
it&#39;s in this space wherever we have a
grade that&#39;s lower than we expected it&#39;s
an opportunity for us to ask for help
from somebody who has mastered that
particular area of life or from someone
who&#39;s just further along without feeling
insecure asking for help from a place of
strength when we look at all of the
world&#39;s most successful people there is
a crystal clear pattern whether it&#39;s
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak Bill Gates
and Paul Allen jay-z and Beyonce Michael
Jordan and Scottie Pippen every success
story in the entire world
involves other people there is no
autobiography written on the face of the
earth
where the author is the only character
in that story this whole notion that
it&#39;s lonely at the top is absolutely not
true because it is not lonely at the top
all the world&#39;s most successful people
move in packs and moves in teams but yet
as we become adults we try to do it all
on our own our contemporary Mark
Zuckerberg who was a genius in his own
right and could have got very far off of
his own intellect said this in a recent
speech no person knows how to deal with
everything find the team of people or
friends or family and notice that he
says team first not friends or family
that&#39;s what&#39;s really going to get you
through you don&#39;t have to be superhuman
you just have to kind of keep going and
not do it all alone find people who
share your passion so I started thinking
about my village the village that is
part of me from the age of 18 until now
and help me become a man and I started
putting all their pictures into this
collage that you see here and all
honesty I would not be Who I am or where
I am today without these people
I don&#39;t attribute part of my success to
these individuals
I actually attribute a majority of my
success to these individuals who have
poured into me in different ways and
different capacities at different
moments in my life you see when my wife
and I were going through our tough times
it was these specific people who I was
able to call on who gave me advice who
prayed and held space for me and just
listened which helped me see myself see
my wife see love see marriage through a
different lens it exposed me to new
thoughts that I can now take to the
table and it&#39;s what allowed my wife and
I have bounced back to a place of joy
and we still have a lot of work to do
but it was because of these people that
we are still together today and my wife
and I are in the process of building our
second marriage not legally but
symbolically and is why we&#39;re to reading
wings now because we had to release our
first marriage we had outgrown it and we
had to create a new one I started my
company on January 9 2009 the absolute
worst time in the in the last 67 years
of the sp500 I didn&#39;t know that then and
though I went to one of the top business
schools in the country I&#39;ll be honest
with you I didn&#39;t know what I was doing
and what helped me get through this wave
get through this time of scarcity we&#39;re
all these people in my village all of
these people supported me through
volunteering through making referrals
who&#39;s giving me feedback and there were
some people I even had to pay for in
terms of coaches consultants or
contractors these are the people that
supported me to be even more specific
these are the people who showed up to my
living room on November 22nd 2008 before
I quit my job to experience a full-day
workshop that I was doing on helping
them find their life purpose and they
gave me powerful feedback from that
experience and that is what literally
set my career on the trajectory that it
is today
this is the power of community so I
recognize that not everybody has this
village that organically formed around
me in my adulthood and that is the
question that wakes me up every single
day my vision is to create a world where
everyone has a team and this is why I
created masterminds org so that people
could find a team and be part of a team
that supports them and creating the life
that they ultimately want so I&#39;ve been
creating mastermind groups all over the
world this is Jimmy Jays in Alberta
Canada Elena in Detroit Michigan Salome
in Brooklyn Fatima and Amsterdam and
Stephen in Minneapolis these are just
some of the pictures and this is not a
Getty image this is an actual group this
is one of the longest-running groups
masterminds in the community and when I
look at this picture I see that a a
meeting I see diversity I see people of
all different cultures in all different
ages and what&#39;s even more special to me
is this young girl sitting on her
father&#39;s lap experiencing her parents
not trying to just figure it out on
their own but actually getting support
and help from other people who simply
want what they want for themselves
so what is a mastermind group a lot of
people may have heard of the word and it
seems like this esoteric thing or this
space that only already
that&#39;s what people are invited to and
that&#39;s not the case similar to a a
mastermind has three criteria which is
it&#39;s a group of people who meet
consistently there&#39;s a space where an
individual can step in the middle of the
group and share a struggle and get
support or coaching from the community
or they can step in and share a
successful that everybody can learn and
it&#39;s also a space where everyone gives
and receives there&#39;s no Google and a
mountain in a mastermind where
everybody&#39;s just bowing at their feet
this is a space where everyone
contributes equally the concept comes
from Napoleon Hill and his book Think
and Grow Rich where he talks about the
mastermind principle and we&#39;ve all
experienced masterminds in different
ways if you&#39;ve ever heard the Pope
whenever two or more gathered or two
heads is better than one or two go fast
go alone go far go together all those
speak to the power of masterminds and
the truth is that you&#39;ve already
probably been part of a mastermind
you&#39;ve ever been part of a Bible study
or a book club or sister circle or a
men&#39;s group or accountability group all
of these are essentially masterminds and
then I the favorite quote that I have
from Jack bowling he adds that a
mastermind group as a space where people
believe for each other things which each
alone may find difficult to conceive or
believe for him or herself we&#39;ve all had
that moment in our life where we were
caught up in self-doubt and had it not
been for someone else around us
believing for us when we didn&#39;t have
belief in ourselves we would have
stopped dead in our tracks but because
they believed in us and for us we were
able to overcome and make it through and
so I went on and started creating
mastermind groups all over the country
and the world and I started joining
mastermind groups and the upper left is
me at a mastermind I&#39;m the youngest
person in that room I am the only
African American in that room and as a
result of being there I was able to soak
up all the wisdom and experience of
people who were 10 years 20 years even
30 years ahead of me in the particular
space that I was masterminding around
this is the power of maximize they can
accelerate your success and your
transformation now a lot of people will
say Julian I have great friends and
family I already have people who believe
in me why do I need a mastermind well
here&#39;s the thing a mastermind isn&#39;t
about surrounding yourself with people
who think just like you like friends and
family because that&#39;s likely where you
got most of your thoughts from anyway
it&#39;s about surrounding yourself with
people who think differently so you&#39;re
exposed to new thoughts about love about
marriage about money about business
about life so that you can actually
expand your awareness of what&#39;s actually
possible for you we also have to
recognize that love is layered and
especially when friends or family have
their lives intertwined with ours when
we decide to take a road that&#39;s less
traveled what tends to happen is that we
tell them for some of you it may have
been changing your major in college or
leaving a job that everybody else
thought was good for your purpose and
what comes up for people is this thick
layer of fear this thick layer of fear
and really that&#39;s just love being masked
because they want you to be safe but
deep down below that layer of fear
people around us simply want us to be
happy and to have what&#39;s best for us but
imagine a space where you could go where
there was no thick layer of fear where
people simply believed for you that
which you want for yourself that&#39;s what
a mastermind is really all about and I
found that the easiest way to access
that is through a coach or through a
team now when people try to start
masterminds they typically think about
their friends and in this age of social
networking we tend to put all of our
friends in the same bucket right imagine
if Facebook had an acquaintance button
things we could awkward pretty quickly
right but we literally have two types of
friends there are our social friends and
our successful friends our social
friends are the people who take you out
to parties they take you out on weekends
they take you out to brunch they take
you out on nice trips and you need your
social friends right life is supposed to
be fun but you&#39;re successful friends are
the people who take you out of your
comfort zone these are the people who
push you to your highest level and it&#39;s
very rare to find somebody who&#39;s both a
social and successful friend this is a
person who would party with you till

3:00 a.m. on Saturday and still wake you

up at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday to work on
that business plan and so when you look
at your network a lot of people have a
lot of social friends but we don&#39;t have
as many successful friends and as the
late great Jim Rohn said you are the
average of the five people you spend the
most time with so if you look at your
network and you don&#39;t have that many
successful friends around you one of the
ways to access a mastermind is through
having a coach remember it says whenever
two or more gathered or two heads is
better than one does
have to be a whole group of people and
when I think about my favorite movies of
all time from the Matrix Malcolm X a
Karate Kid there was always this
character whether it&#39;s mr. Miyagi
Murphy&#39;s or brother Baines who was
holding space for the main character and
believing for them that which they could
not believe in themselves yet and that&#39;s
what a coach does a coach literally
compress his time and expands your
awareness of what&#39;s possible for you in
your life I&#39;m a huge LeBron James fan
and he often times he is compared to
Kobe Bryant in Michael Jordan and what
people fail to recognize is that Kobe
Bryant and Michael Jordan literally had
the best coach in NBA history LeBron
James has taken all rookie coaches to
the NBA Finals if LeBron James had Phil
Jackson or Gregg Popovich as his coach
he would probably have 10 NBA
championships by now this is the power
of a coach and so how did I build my
village one I accepted that I did not
know everything and that opened me up to
receiving help too I invited my
successful friends to mastermind with me
around very specific areas in my life
and then I found mentors or hired
coaches that would support me as well so
a lot of people say that success is just
a matter of time if you work hard enough
you get enough education one day you&#39;ll
be successful and while those are
important I found that success is really
a matter of team we are a tribal people
and so if you want to transform your
life find your tribe or create it thank
you so much
