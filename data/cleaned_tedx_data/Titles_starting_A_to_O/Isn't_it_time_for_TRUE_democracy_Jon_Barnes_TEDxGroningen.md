Hey
oh my and before we start I want to
introduce my grandma to you guys here
she is we call her mama
this summer we celebrated her 95th
birthday so she&#39;s been alive almost a
century she&#39;s seen commercial flights TV
the internet so a lot of change as well
as some incredibly inspiring social
movements like gay rights women&#39;s rights
the environmental movement now I love a
lot of things about my nan but one thing
that perhaps amazes me most about her is
how over the years she&#39;s managed to
change her point of view on the world as
the world has changed and so don&#39;t get
me wrong in lots of ways she&#39;s very very
traditional and conservative but there
are other ways where her views are so
nuanced oh just recently for instance
she supported a friend financially so
that they could have the surgery to have
a gender transition I think it&#39;s amazing
at 95 years old so she&#39;s really open to
change there&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t
changed at all in my Nan&#39;s lifetime is
politics so every four years she still
drives to her local village hall where
without even having to show her ID she
takes a piece of paper she puts it in
the ballot box and from then on she
outsources all of her decisions for the
next four years to someone else
so in an era where we have the
technology to crowdsource all of our
collective decisions she still out
sources her opinion on every issue to
someone else and in 2017 I think that&#39;s
mad so I wanted I want to do a little
test on that in this room okay we&#39;re
gonna do a quick a quick quiz we&#39;re
going to vote we&#39;re gonna vote on
dress code how will your dress all right
so I&#39;m gonna you&#39;re gonna have two
options option one is you dress like a
skater and option two is you wear a suit
all right so we&#39;ll start with the raise
of hands for option one who would like
to dress like a skater okay and option
two to wear a suit mmm I&#39;m gonna say
there&#39;s a fifty to forty eight split in
favor of dressing like a skater now
you&#39;re probably thinking this is
ridiculous it&#39;s particularly ridiculous
because you might have wanted to wear
that say jeans in a jacket like you
probably wanted to choose the items but
the the question was choose one thing
and choose the whole thing and that&#39;s
how democracy today works we choose one
ideology and we adopt it wholesale so it
strikes me that everything&#39;s changed in
my grandma&#39;s lifetime everything accepts
for democracy and so this used to be
understandable right we couldn&#39;t vote on
every issue because the only technology
we had was pen and paper and a box and
so hierarchy was the only way you could
scale participation but that doesn&#39;t
have to be that way anymore because it&#39;s
2017 and in 2017 we have amazing
technology from Wikipedia to our likes
our swipes these are already methods we
use to crowdsource our collective
opinions and so for the first time in
history we now have the technology to
create true democracy
which we&#39;ve never seen before and so
this will be a form of democracy that I
think will be more engaging more
effective or more efficient and
ultimately just more democratic than
anything we&#39;ve seen before so how can I
be so sure about this well I&#39;m sure
because it&#39;s already happening it&#39;s
happening in companies so I help
organizations to be run by their people
some
some people call them self-managed
organizations and what we see is that
organizations run by their people have
happier people they have happier
customers they&#39;re more profitable and
they&#39;re more resilient to economic ups
and downs so how is this well I think
there are three principles that explain
this like pretty neatly the first is
that these organizations are always
evolving so rather than let&#39;s say take
on huge projects or have a five-year
business plan or manifesto what they&#39;ll
do is that they&#39;ll put their work in
small chunks and they&#39;ll prototype very
fast and iterate so they&#39;re constantly
changing what they do and how they do it
a second important principle is that
they have like an obsession with the
customer so rather than let&#39;s say go up
the hierarchy to decide if a customer is
going to get a refund or not what
they&#39;ll do is they&#39;ll let the person
closest to the customer decide because
they trust that person and they trust
that organizing themselves around the
customer will bring them more success
and then a third principle but perhaps
the most important is that these
organizations don&#39;t have powerful people
they have really powerful processes so
each team or each meeting would have a
coach or a facilitator someone who&#39;s
totally neutral who has no say in the
decision their job is to focus on the
process the process by which the
decision is made their job is to help
the group decide and that&#39;s what
democracy is
so once you&#39;ve worked in this way
working working in an old-school
organization just doesn&#39;t really make
sense it&#39;s less human and it&#39;s far less
effective so with this in mind I started
asking myself this question if companies
work better when they&#39;re run by people
couldn&#39;t we scale that using technology
so that at long last countries can be
run by citizens and the answer is yes
and the answer is it&#39;s already happening
in small innovative pockets around the
planet it&#39;s being built right now so
let&#39;s let&#39;s go through our principles
and check this again always evolving
my friend finner in Iceland was a part
of a group who crowd-sourced the
constitution of Iceland and the way they
did it is every Friday they would
publish a draft version of that
constitution online and get feedback
from their citizens spending the whole
following week adapting it for the world
that we live in
second was customer focus while in
Estonia there a residency program asked
users for feedback to such a degree that
they&#39;ve changed numerous laws in just a
few months a speed that you&#39;d never see
in another country and which shows that
they&#39;re organizing in their government
around their people not the other way
around and then finally powerful
processes so I&#39;m on the tectum up the
board of a tech democracy movement
called my votes and what we&#39;re doing is
using blockchain technology to create
the first form of true direct democracy
and the way we do that is that we have a
robust process so we start as democracy
should by asking the people what their
will is because that&#39;s what we should
enact and so we put this on every issue
to a decision we ask what what&#39;s your
will then we have independent
researchers give some key facts so that
people are informed in order to make
that decision rather than misinformed
and based on those facts if you choose
to read them you can then choose between
four options where you choose to support
or not support in other words we don&#39;t
come in and say we have an ideology that
solves all your problems we ask what
your will is and enact that because
that&#39;s what democracy is and so this is
what real democracy will look like it&#39;ll
be more engaging but it&#39;ll also be safer
because it&#39;ll be distributed so no ins
or outs left or rights red or blues this
will be a case of asking people to vote
frequently on more nuanced direct
decisions because when you do that it&#39;s
mathematically impossible for one
ideology to capture all votes on every
decision so populism can hijack one
decision every four years but it can&#39;t
hijack hundreds and so this is really
exciting for democracy this is why we&#39;re
speaking to the UN governments and most
continents to make this a reality so my
question to you and my ask of us all is
that we change the conversation that we
don&#39;t just focus on being enraged with
politics but we also become engaged in
democracy itself like we don&#39;t just talk
about what decisions are being made and
that are in the media but we also talk
on how those decisions are being made
and importantly that we support these
tech democracy movements around the
world who are focusing on redesigning
the system itself because democracy
needs an upgrade for the 21st century
when Tim berners-lee gave us the web he
said this is for everyone and soon I
believe we&#39;ll be able to say that for
democracy too Thanks
