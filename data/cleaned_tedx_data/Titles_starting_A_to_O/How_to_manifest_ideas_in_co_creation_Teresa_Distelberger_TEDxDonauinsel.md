so today I&#39;m standing here on stage you
see me and you hear me
maybe you tomorrow you will remember
something that I said it all looks as if
I am creating this talk but I would not
be saying this very words without you
listening to me
why would I be talking if there would be
nobody receiving my words I would not be
here without the people who set up your
chairs and the ones who did all the
communication around so that you and I
are sharing this room in this moment
it&#39;s actually there hosting that makes
me talk even before without the
invitation of the organizers I would
have not put my thoughts together in
this very focused TEDx way and I would
have not stumbled along for the last
weeks with all my ideas and with my
doubts with my ideas and doubts and
without the long list of loving friends
and wild guides I would have never made
it to that point it&#39;s because they
listened to all my very vague ideas and
helped me sort them out it&#39;s their
patience and support that makes me stand
here today and usually we tend to forget
that all of them all of you and I we are
co-creating this moment I am fascinated
by the fact that so often when something
new is created you will find these two
elements something that is holding space
that is receiving nurturing supporting
and something that can express itself in
that space
because most of the really great stuff
we cannot do alone I notice very well
from filmmaking recently I&#39;ve often been
the one who was publicly representing
this film it&#39;s sukoon of this path I see
hoof the future is better than its
reputation it&#39;s a collective documentary
about people who are engaged in social
change and there&#39;s a very complex
co-creative process behind we were
several directors I&#39;m one of them and
also the producer and the editor had
very important trade if roles when you
watch the film in the end you seen the
credits more than 200 names this is that
twice as many people as you see in this
picture team protagonists people on
location and all somehow contributed for
the film to be what it is and what we
can see in movie theaters this is when I
what I want to talk about today how
ideas come from imagination to reality
and how we are all contributing in one
way or another to really give them shape
give them form to make them real but
first let&#39;s start at the very beginning
let&#39;s zoom in for a moment into the
mystical process of manifestation it all
starts with an idea but where is this
idea coming from I want to use a
metaphor of one of my teachers
Thomas Weber let&#39;s imagine now that in
this room there is something like a
white cloud and it&#39;s hanging in midair
right above you this cloud is full of
potential ideas for the future but it&#39;s
only when one of us very personally
connects to one of these ideas that the
special bond is being formed
when I contemplate this in my own
experience it&#39;s somehow it&#39;s a mixture
of kind of reaching out and being open
to receive in these moments is as if I
am becoming that ball for the idea tool
and it&#39;s a very intimate moment and
sometimes we&#39;re just flirting you know
there are a lot of ideas around and we
go around oh this would be cool and this
would be cool but then comes the moment
when you really fall in love and then
you know okay that&#39;s it I want to see
that in the world I&#39;m ready I&#39;m ready to
commit something changes you&#39;re ready
also to take a risk to invest your time
and it she made even money without
knowing if ever something will come out
of it and that&#39;s a very important moment
Peter kunuk was doing a lot of work with
founders of companies he calls that
you&#39;re becoming the source of the
project and you will always have
something like a more direct connection
a special bond with the potential future
of this project and when you step in
into a project after that first person
it&#39;s very wise to honor that I want to
give you an example I once worked with
Nicole shayok a very dear colleague of
mine she&#39;s also filmmaker and she was
writing a concept of her new film the
sleep mist connect in a higher power
life isn&#39;t a rehearsal it&#39;s a film about
one of the last two making factories in
Austria and it&#39;s rebellious owner
Hainish tauranga so I joined her and
working on the concept the concept was
great we got the funding and I even
learned to be a sound operator to be
able to be with her in the shooting of
the film as well first it was great we
had all these conversations I could also
contribute a lot with my own background
what I know about alternative economy
but there was a moment when we somehow
got stuck
somehow she could not feel her own
connection to the film anymore that
clearly and we realized that I had to
step back a bit she needed to feel the
void of not knowing long enough for her
own truths to rise it was very hard in
the beginning for me not to jump in with
suggestions anymore sometimes I was
there holding space for her
clarification and it felt like in a yoga
I had something I wanted to say but I
was not saying it in special moments so
that she could have the space and I
realized in this moment that I often
thought co-creation means we are all
doing something but in these moments the
best I could do for the success of the
whole project was be there for her and
this is also when I decided to look in
much more detail in this what is the
power of these supportive qualities when
we are co-creating so of course there
are a lot of different ways of how we
collaborate but I want to highlight for
you three archetypes of these supportive
qualities that you may have come across
in your own life as well the first one
is the news the second the midwife and
the Gardiners so let&#39;s start with the
muse I think we all know how helpful it
is when you can talk about a fresh idea
and often there is something like a
searching in these very early
conversations it&#39;s simply a pleasure to
be with someone who is there able to
receive all this unfiltered information
who can ask wise questions maybe even
challenge you but being critical in the
right dose but then also in some moments
you know that when they are also getting
excited themselves and then you see them
they&#39;re sitting in front of you and on
their face you see simply like yes tell
me more about it yes so this is somehow
how the energy is flowing even more it
is as if the talking is a fountain of
water and the bowl is the listening
without this bowl the flow would simply
about the listening the quality of the
listening is often co-creating what can
be put into words it sounds very simple
but it can be crucial for how an idea
takes on form a good news you&#39;ll pick
the pearls out of your random salt and
hand them back to you as a brilliant
necklace so when an idea is landing and
then slowly sinking in deeper it often
hits our deepest fears do you know that
part I do and in these moments we need a
midwife because the midwife they already
see that there is something growing
inside of us in its own pace it will
want to come out they know that it will
probably turn us inside out and they
already know that there might be a
moment when you go and you say okay stop
it now I just leave it all together I&#39;m
not doing this in these moments they are
standing behind you reminding you to
simply breathe to collect your forces
and then try again they will celebrate
you the moment it comes out but it&#39;s the
midwives who often help us to keep going
in very crucial
months and there is another beautiful
quality maybe did you ever try to grow
your own tomatoes until we can eat them
it takes quite a lot of care and
attention watering looking after it on a
very daily basis and without the help of
gardeners a lot of good ideas would
never be able to really flourish
I like the gardener&#39;s also because you
know gardeners very good at discerning
what they want to support and what you
want to leave aside I feel very honored
when someone who has this gardening
quality wants to join me in a project
also resonates with my little plant I
know that in this part I&#39;m very bad when
I&#39;m doing it alone but together it&#39;s
much more fun it&#39;s actually the
nurturing of the gardener&#39;s it&#39;s this
all this loving care that lets a good
idea
grow strong roots in the world grow tall
and big so that we also have fruits that
will nurture us and can nurture others
and maybe also seeds so that it can
spread even further why am I telling you
all of this it&#39;s because I believe that
this is how we can help the future tool
and there&#39;s a lot of work to do right
now and you can do it together in Latin
there&#39;s a small syllable
called a prefix one word that sums it
all up Cole
it literally means together or with and
this is also very visible in our daily
language so much that we love and that
we are involved in has this Latin Coe
included companies cooperatives
communication connection you can choose
your own favorite covert
I like very much divert consciousness
it literally means knowing together and
I believe that we need a lot of Avernus
and consciousness around these processes
of co-creation and really honor all will
contribute as muses as midwives as
gardeners and if we all more consciously
aware of the power that often stands
behind the ones who are in the spotlight
all of us will shine more so these are
the people who were standing behind me
and a little bit of their energy and
wisdom was also flowing through that
talk let&#39;s honor all who contributed for
us being here together and don&#39;t forget
your listening is co-creating all that
talking on stage thank you
