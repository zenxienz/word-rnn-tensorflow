so that just happened the homeschooled
I got the opportunity of time and
society didn&#39;t have the chance to limit
me that allowed me to approach the
guitar in any way I liked I played flat
I tried different tunings I haven&#39;t
tried playing with my chin one time and
I didn&#39;t even learn theory and my
curiosity didn&#39;t really stop there
starting my first business at the age of
13 society couldn&#39;t put an age limit on
me so I created my first company and
projects all in different fields
nanotechnology software education game
design drone technology and this was all
while training to be a professional
tennis player so society society
couldn&#39;t define my limitations so I
could define my own and this was just a
small glimpse of what a child can do
with the power of curiosity it out lies
everything adults can comprehend so now
I&#39;m gonna show you something a little
incomprehensible yep
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Music]
all coming from my mouth well yeah this
is all coming from my mouth and this is
just a small example of a limitation set
on you guys
because what beatboxing is is it&#39;s
actually speaking and we&#39;re speaking in
syllables and what&#39;s the first thing we
all conform to when we&#39;re born
well that&#39;s speech so let&#39;s try and
remove this limitation now so everyone
say boo take a card take it take a blue
car okay well it&#39;s pretty simple
everyone can do that right and so what
if we now replace these syllables with
sounds so do with take a car with right
so let&#39;s replace all of these so it
becomes who took a car to get to keep
you accountable
so yeah so now I&#39;m gonna do the hardest
speed I know which is basically doing
five beats at the same time so you guys
ready first speed sorry fifth so that is
actually just like we can&#39;t speak out
word we can speak in order as well and
we can manipulate that and that&#39;s
basically the fifth sound which is in
word breathing in word yeah so let&#39;s put
all five sounds together so
[Music]

[Laughter]
[Applause]
so eventually I had to come back to a
regular school
unfortunately because education that&#39;s
when I realized education was just a
complete mess and we we kind of all know
that now so this all led me to start my
gamified education initiative Seibel so
imagine a ten-year-old kid he loves cars
right the ten-year-old kid loves cars
what do we normally do we give him a toy
car to play with but what if we could
give him a game or a simulation where
resources aren&#39;t a limitation and this
child has the tools to build his own car
in that virtual reality who&#39;s to say
this ten-year-old kid can&#39;t build the
car and now with 3d printing
technologies of the future we could
bring this kind to reality so who&#39;s
limiting kids well that&#39;s us
would you say
