I was good the t20 World Cup has just
ended and it&#39;s I feel season so it&#39;s you
know kept in the air so if you ask any
kid what you would like to be in future
it&#39;s very likely that he would say he
wants to become like a Tony or a surgeon
and it&#39;s no wonder that Tony and sits in
both our two biopics under production in
Bollywood there was a guy called mark
she was in undergrad in Harvard
University and he wanted to be like
idiots
like most kids had her dream and Mark
was really lucky one day bill the
billiards was invited to hard world so
Marco in there he his second last in the
last photo of the hall I think this much
for I see Bill Gates the person he was
driven to be so very soon mark started a
company called Facebook and he didn&#39;t
build it but he he became Mark
Zuckerberg the you know the person who
as revolution is the world of a social
network so mark would leave his ring he
did the job which he wanted to do but
most of the kids that who are aspiring
to become a Dornier setting may not even
play cricket in their life like you like
most of you know be like let me get most
of you we may not land up in a job which
we do I mean which I&#39;ve been really to
do from the childhood like I become an
engineer and I think like most of you in
this room I went to college but that was
not I want you to dream from the
beginning while I went to the Community
College is something like this you see
on this ads in front of the LCC or jeans
that you know 10 kilo weight reduction
guaranteed some people end up in two
villages with this assurance that it was
vo the school buddy right I think angles
go into item the same
[Music]
that was it&#39;s not a description that we
have so I think in the last few minutes
how many number of times of passion
and thanks to my colleague Meenakshi I
am actually plugging this this word from
word because he keeps on using this
world so it should happen sometime back
I was really down I was not getting
publisher for my second book so my first
book which is costly the historical
trillion and and and it sold few copies
and and people liked it and and my
publisher was very keen on in insisting
me to write a sequel for that but here
mother historical Scylla you cannot keep
on writing through the wanna fry another
right and I liked it of writing a book
which is about what I&#39;m talking passion
entails love story right and which I
wrote for my heart but the publisher was
not happening
Emma&#39;s insisting the palette
secretly closed Chabad clear so I I was
giving up on on this thing right
and I started writing Instagram so
that&#39;s when Meenakshi told me never get
a publisher I was I thought what is this
you know in this very rude right this is
and then she don&#39;t you remember that
line from Shahrukh Khan I was again a
little more so it&#39;s something seriously
you know like I&#39;m a little down when I&#39;m
not getting publisher and then she
stopped short Haruka but the line she
told it in retail ethnic shit that&#39;s a
magnet to my panic ecosystem her certain
image a to single and you suggested that
is a very important thing but passion
this is intensity if you intensely in
love with something if you intensely
passionate about something every
particle of the universe conspires to
make it happen you don&#39;t have to you
don&#39;t have to do anything you have that
intensity it will happen when you are
intensely passionate about something you
are in love and be in love with
something means believing in that that
so strongly that there is no doubt there
is no out of counterpart that it&#39;s like
you see that thing every moment of your
life every day every moment of the day
you just think about that when you&#39;re
dreaming when you are sleeping or
dreaming about that you know it&#39;s like
the Ferber soy muy muy and you have this
deep within you right I&#39;m DJ DJ DJ
and that&#39;s where the energy from within
you it get transfers to each and every
particle of the universe and everything
is moved and everything conspires to
make it happen you would have heard this
story that went unseen use to scientific
route it would be fire all around when
is to saying well Hara in to drain I
don&#39;t know what these triple
authenticity of this thing I don&#39;t know
I don&#39;t care about that but what is
reporting these are very symbolic thing
right
you have that much intensity with the
new world the universe cannot be unmoved
universe is in the second aspect is
third it&#39;s a passion word and ok why I
am using this Persian and Arabic things
because both this language is a really
some of the passionate languages of the
world because I am routine partying Rumi
wrote in person gulley routing person
and that&#39;s why I am you know lit more
influenced by these two languages and
I&#39;m using some of these words again and
again in some Bollywood you know the
good thing of all you do is that it
teaches us a lot of things in very
simple way very simple and unassuming
reason Roxxon to remember that above
Allah who is to give this game to learn
a couple about what is needed to be a
rock star so what used to think is
something very similar what Tagore wrote
in one of the poems in Gitanjali if the
pang of separation that Sprint&#39;s
throughout the world and gives birth to
the ship&#39;s innumerable in the infinite
sky so these words are film they go so
that&#39;s something which is the source of
all creativity and if you don&#39;t have
that within you I think nothing happens
so we you know I mean one thing comes to
mind have you heard of any writer who
cannot write so this so this something
will writers cramp it&#39;s a neutral
logical disorder where you can do
everything else in the world you can
sing you can dance you can play but you
cannot write it with your hand suggest
one week before my board exams I figured
out that I have writers can so I had to
get a writer to give my board exam so I
dictated mass and
and ever since I&#39;ve been doing that so I
think you know that somewhere that pay
you that worked and that might have
become you become strength within me
that finally I lined it up the become a
right there who cannot write so
structure was kicked out of Apple and
when you skipped out he was obviously
you know seriously pain and during that
period of pain he created Pixar which
revolutionized the way cartoons are made
and when he came back to Apple the rest
is history revolution is the way you
listen to music and the way you use
phones when you turn the when you was
very old used to sit in front of the sea
and used to always think that Ice King
is a little kid playing with pebbles in
front of a big ocean of knowledge which
is unknown to him and he lived in the
last day of his life with this pain that
has done he has not done enough same
thing with bigger every front of dipper
you know towards the end of his life few
stories have this insecurity that you
put me forget me
hi nice to always have this you know
dreadful villain is dreamed that bonding
Stamper orbit there at the corner of the
room and and to collect dust super
select ago he lived to the last day of
his life with this
so it has to be so ten years the couple
was inhibited usually talking about
Shiro shine
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that&#39;s like a cheetah spark
[Music]
so some submitters reported you to
connect the dots and you since
[Music]
[Applause]
