you have the power to change the world
with every interaction with each person
that you encounter you can make a change
all it takes is a choice a choice to
connect a choice to be in the moment to
be wholly present and to form a
connection with the people standing
right next to you the most powerful way
to connect to people together is through
a shared experience and some of the most
powerful shared experiences the two that
come to mind for me are sharing a crisis
and sharing some laughter now I&#39;m sure
you&#39;ve all experienced how a crisis
brings people together 16 years ago in
the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11 and
today as we contemplate and try to make
sense of the devastation caused by the
hurricanes laughter on the other hand is
a little bit more complicated to explain
after all what is laughter how do you
explain it now I could stand here and
put up charts and share with you
scientific research that explains how
laughter happens what causes it and how
laughter pulls people together but to me
I think the author EB White really got
it right he said analyzing humor is like
dissecting a frog few people are
interested and the Frog dies
so instead of all of this gobs of data
that are would not stick with you
instead we&#39;re gonna do little
demonstration and to do a demonstration
I&#39;m gonna need some help Sam didn&#39;t
mention it but I am a ventriloquist that
is what I do and so we&#39;re gonna get a
little friend out here come on fish
