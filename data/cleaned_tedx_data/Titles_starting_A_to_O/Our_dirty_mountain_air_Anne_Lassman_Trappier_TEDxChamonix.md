we&#39;re here in the Alps in the stunningly
beautiful mumbling area to talk about
air pollution not a subject generally
associated with the mountains is it the
air here just as elsewhere is not so
great anymore but here the majestic
surrounding around us that are so
mesmerizing make us more aware or the
fatness of the situation in truth it&#39;s a
hard break but local residents aren&#39;t
standing for it and are acting to bring
good air quality back to the alps
through the tireless work of local
environmental organizations the issue of
dirty mountain air has made it to the
media and also has brought a lot of air
awareness about this problem we&#39;re also
working to bring about solutions after
all where mountain people and we fight
when there&#39;s a problem we find a
solution we find a way let&#39;s start with
a fun fact did you know that 92 percent
of the world&#39;s population are exposed to
unsafe levels of air quality this is in
fact from the welfare health
organization young children are
particularly vulnerable to air pollution
because their lungs and their organs
aren&#39;t fully developed every single day
in the world a thousand five hundred
children under the age of five died due
to air pollution let&#39;s zoom into France
where on a daily basis a hundred and
forty-five people are killed prematurely
due to air pollution this is nearly ten
percent of all deaths this is 15 times
more than road traffic accidents
surprisingly only 20 percent of such
deaths are through respiratory causes
80% of casualties are in fact
cardiovascular related that&#39;s heart
attacks and strokes many doctors you
will find are unaware of this fact
because epi
is actually a fairly new science and
this is not taught at medical school
this chart compares the health impact of
air pollution in France
compared with two other countries per
hundred thousand of population if you
come from Sweden or Canada you might
think you&#39;ve made a mistake moving to
France if you from the UK or Italy on
the other hand you might think you&#39;ve
made a good move
the trouble is a killer is everywhere
we&#39;ve long known city air was polluted
but now we know that mountain air isn&#39;t
so clean and so pure anymore
air pollution is quite symptomatic of
the way we view our environment let&#39;s
face it we take it for granted we abuse
it we forget to notice how essential
nature is to our life instead we keep
poisoning it but in truth
we&#39;re poisoning ourselves the air here
in Germany is over the EU legal limit
for a pollutant linked to Road Transport
it&#39;s called nitrogen dioxide in the
lower our Valley in Pasi two other
pollutants are breaching European and
French standards the benzo a pyrene and
fine particles they are both linked to
industry and ready residential heating
in summer ozone pollution is all too
present in the Alps this is a
ground-level pollutant created by a
reaction between the sunshine and
Industry and traffic emissions the ozone
loves finding areas where the air is
clean so on hot summer days the higher
you go in the mountains the more
concentrated ozone pollution becomes the
deep narrow valleys that make our
scenery so stunning here also act as a
trap for pollution add a little cold
sunny weather in winter or hot sunshine
in summer and it all goes pear-shaped in
winter
on cold sunny days the air above the
valley warms up faster than on the
ground
therefore trapping all the air at the
bottom of the valley including all the
pollutants and this if the nice weather
carries on then bill pollution builds up
at Valley level and it causes a
pollution peak this is similar by the
way in other valley situations like in
Grenoble in France or in Salt Lake City
in the US and we are just talking about
a few pollutants here but just with
these pollutants we can see that the air
that we breathe isn&#39;t so clean isn&#39;t so
great here&#39;s another fun fact nearly 400
pollutants have been identified linked
with traffic and road infrastructure 30
of which are cancer cancer-causing and a
hundred more that are known toxics dozen
more pollutants are emitted by industry
by heating systems and even by
agriculture and no this is not from cows
breaking wind this is from pesticides
and chemical fertilizers not such a
great picture is it as if it wasn&#39;t bird
enough
some would like us to believe that the
air in Germany is more polluted than the
air in Beijing or in New Delhi this has
actually been quoted on French
television let&#39;s get the facts right the
air in Germany is above world health
standard and above for some pollutants
above EU levels but it&#39;s nowhere near as
toxic as the air in China as in India as
soon as we go up in the mountains in
winter we arise above the pollution
layer and we can actually see it this is
not lovely Valley haze mountain haze
this is a pollution cloud this pollution
and over half a million trucks that
cross the border to Italy through Mont
Blanc through the Mont Blanc tunnel
every year
have long been unacceptable to people
living here the local movement for the
protection of the environment has been
going strong for 20 years in Xiamen II
and this in spite of the strong forces
against us you&#39;ve all heard of the road
lobby the car lobby the oil lobby but
diesel lobby well let me tell you tell
you they do exist and we soon find that
found out about their incredible power
the hard way five years ago we citizens
decided to do things differently by
launching a visible and active campaign
for air quality and we quickly started
getting results trying to get
politicians to initiate big changes and
implement an entirely new transport
policy wasn&#39;t working so we created a
nonprofit organization called inspire
and with a bottom-up approach to show
many people cared and wanted change
we set a three point strategy work on a
futures and issues and get results gets
many people involved so decision makers
can no longer ignore us and be positive
and offer solutions to politicians but
also to the general public so they
actually want to be part of our movement
this quickly became a success and
politicians started to notice us and ask
us for our suggestions and our expertise
and even on the mammoth issue of
international Goods transport we started
making headways for the first time in
France we managed to get a local decree
saying that during pollution Peaks
trucks can be temporarily banned from
mobile eternal in order to protect
public health when you consider that one
of the founding principles of European
law is the free circulation of free
movement of people and goods this was
actually a big result a big hurdle
is that local politicians and mayor&#39;s
have actually no jurisdiction whatsoever
over the traffic going through Moonglow
tunnel or its access road this is
actually the preserve of the French and
Italian governments and we need to
attract their attention to try and get
measures applied and this is such a
difficult task
all of this pollution worldwide or local
you realize is in reality man-made
pollution of course we all love blaming
someone else for it some say the tracks
are to blame others say it&#39;s industry so
I&#39;m likely to blame it all on
politicians or on their neighbors all of
this is partially true but in fact we
are all responsible for the toxic air
that we breathe through our cars through
our heating systems and also through
what we buy because let&#39;s not forget
that most Goods travel long distances to
get to us and have a huge effect on the
air quality but also on our climate yes
pollution is a global issue but it is at
local level that we can most efficiently
act to reduce it if we want to break
bread breathe better air we need to
reduce all types of emissions so here&#39;s
another fact locally nearly 60 percent
of particles are from our heating
systems and 40 percent of traffic gases
are emitted from our cars mostly diesels
so what can we do here&#39;s here are a few
tips we have actually an effect direct
effect on three sources of a pollution
emissions our homes and energy
consumption what we buy and our trips
and travels regarding our homes the most
efficient solution is obviously to
insulate them better so we reduce
consumption whatever the source of
energy
then comes the solar choice of energy
direct solar heating is by far the
cheapest and cleanest energy retrieving
the heat from the ground through a heat
pump is also a clean solution gas is a
halfway house as it emits no particles
but it emits greenhouse gases and other
pollutants and then there&#39;s wood-burning
heating much vilified because of its
particles emissions so how bad is it
when we think of the mountains we
picture beautiful mountain chalets and
crackling open fireplaces well here&#39;s a
fact an open fireplace emits up to a
hundred times more particles than an
efficient wood-burning stove in a modern
stove the fires raging behind the glass
door and the emissions are efficiently
burned through a double combustion
system this type of system is acceptable
in terms of emissions it also uses a
local source of energy lead needing
little transport and it also emits less
co2 than fossil fuels with an open
fireplace the pollution is also worse
inside our homes that lovely smell of
burning wood the relaxing sight of a
crackling open fire
a sure sign that we are breathing in
great quantities of particles one thing
we can and must all do is to avoid using
open fireplaces as much as possible
regarding our purchases this is a less
direct impact but it it is our impact on
air quality try and buy product that is
as local as possible
markets are a great place to start and
they are so lovely here in France make
it as seasonal as possible because the
goods produce will be grown closer and
needs less transport
here&#39;s another fun-filled fact one kilo
of Apple coming from South Africa needs
five liters of oil to get here whereas
one kilo of apple grown in France needs
ten times 20 times less or than that our
trip son travels our most direct impact
on air quality and it&#39;s probably our
biggest effect on overall air pollution
you probably think you and your children
are protected from the outside air when
you&#39;re safely ensconced in your car with
the aircon on think again the confined
space and a car is in fact a trap for
pollution especially gases so inside
your car you&#39;re five times more exposed
to pollution to air pollution than a
cyclist outside on the same route for
better air quality we need to rethink
our trips reduce the use of highly
emitting fossil fuel transport we need
to try and bring into the mix more
walking and cycling because they
obviously the cleanest way of getting
around we can also use public transport
and car sharing and for longer distances
take the train in Western Europe trains
are pretty damn good and efficient when
taking into account the completes
door-to-door cost and time they&#39;re also
pretty competitive it&#39;s also a very
civilized way of travelling but don&#39;t
take my word for it try it yourself many
of you will think what&#39;s the use of such
small tips steps well let me assure you
they do matter because when millions of
us make small changes to our habits
imagine what that can do to overall air
quality and last but not least give a
helping hand to environmental
organization whose volunteers do an
amazing job trying to protect the
environment achieve better
quality and therefore protect our health
and our future locally here&#39;s one
accomplishment we had we organized our
first veneration that&#39;s a bike rally
here in 2014 hundreds of people turned
up and a mayor of Xiamen E publicly
recognized that not enough had been done
for cycling facilities he promised more
soon feeling the strength of public
opinion behind him he convinced the
local council to vote in a plan and
funding over four years to build cycle
lanes in 2016 the new cycle lane was
built and more will follow
we organized many such events and we
need people engaged to make a difference
and we would love for you to join us too
thank you
[Applause]
