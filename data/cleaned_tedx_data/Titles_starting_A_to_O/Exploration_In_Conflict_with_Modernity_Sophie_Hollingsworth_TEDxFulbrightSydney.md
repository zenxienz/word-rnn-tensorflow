I&#39;m frequently told that I was born 200
years too late apparently I missed this
great age of exploration now I disagree
but with the world&#39;s tallest peaks
climbed the depths of our ocean reached
and the poles mapped it is a seemingly
valid question what is left to explore
believe it or not even in 2017 we know
far less about our world than you might
think we know more about Mars than what
lies beneath our own oceans we recently
discovered an entirely undocumented
rainforest in Mozambique and indigenous
cultures are disappearing before their
knowledge is shared exploration is no
longer about planting your nations flag
in an uncharted territory or being the
first to summit the world&#39;s tallest
mountains while these accomplishments
are iconic they&#39;re part of a larger
fabric of exploration today exploration
is about increasing our knowledge and
understanding of the world we live in
which for me often means living with
indigenous communities in experiencing
alternative ways of interacting with the
earth in my time with these remote
communities I&#39;ve found we all face the
same challenges food water shelter love
yet given these common challenges the
range of cultural adaptation is
extraordinary let me give you a little
bit of background as a young girl I
devoured articles in National Geographic
about deforestation and tribes
disappearing at alarming rates and I
remember feeling this immense sense of
urgency along with the realization that
I could be a part of one of the last
generations to live in a world where
such remote places even exist
I knew pretty early on that if I wanted
to see these remote places before they
disappeared I was gonna have to act fast
so when the opportunity arose to explore
a potential anthropological anomaly
female Chiefs in the Pacific Islands of
Vanuatu I was ecstatic because for over
a hundred years
literature declared that there were no
female Chiefs in Vanuatu but in 2016 a
team and I discovered that there were in
fact female Chiefs
in Vanuatu now for me the discovery of
female Chiefs demonstrated that the
golden age of exploration wasn&#39;t over
exploration is now more important than
ever because there is a time pressure
that did not exist for explorers 200
years ago as a result of globalization
and climate change practices fundamental
to indigenous cultures such as sand
drawing and water music are disappearing
at alarming rates and with every single
one of these worldviews that fades we&#39;re
left with the diminished capacity to the
common challenges that face us all the
people of Vanuatu are famous for their
tradition of sand Rolly now sand Rolly
developed is this method of
communication between tribes in a
country of over a hundred and fifteen
different language groups sand drawings
are made in the ground when the Jala
uses one finger to trace this continuous
line which ends up creating a beautiful
design but these designs are more than
art they transmit rituals mythology
everyday songs and events but now they
can also be used like a text message or
a note say you went to visit your
neighbor and they weren&#39;t home you could
crank out a little sand drawing by their
front Hut entry to say hey Bob stop by
to say hi hope all&#39;s well with you and
the family but globalization is now
affecting even these most remote remote
corners of the earth continually
expanding telephone networks in Vanuatu
have meant that most youngsters are more
interested in learning to text in the
national language of beach llama then
learning the sand rawlings in their
island language seems we aren&#39;t the only
ones concerned about our youngsters
becoming glued to technology but
globalization is not the only factor
deserting the time pressure on modern
exploration climate change poses a
threat to our global diversity of
culture and the village of neuro Varro
access to clean drinking water used to
be found in a spring I&#39;m here five
minute walk from the village women would
go to the spring to collect drinking
water and engage in the practice of
water music a mesmerizing tradition that
involves standing waist-deep in the
water and and rhythmically slapping the
water&#39;s surface to create this aquatic
symphony now that spring I mention that
was a five minute walk from the village
its scents dried up after years of
unprecedented drought now the women must
walk 30 minutes each way to collect
drinking water
it&#39;s a strenuous walk deep in the jungle
and by the time they get to the new
natural spring they&#39;re tired and tight
on time which has resulted in a decline
in the amount of water music being
practiced and while it may not seem like
a big deal to you and me that these
women on a tiny island or practicing
water music less it is a threat to our
ethnosphere and cultural survival
besides how boring would it be if we
were all one homogeneous culture glued
to our smartphones
unfortunately these cultural effects of
climate change are not limited to this
tiny cluster of islands it&#39;s a worldwide
phenomenon that I&#39;ve observed with San
Bushmen in Namibia
off the coast of Panama with the Kuna
and when not being chased by crocodiles
on the banks of the Ola High River in
Madagascar so in my time exploring and I
often find myself alone alone in places
with concerning histories of cannibalism
violence against women and most tropical
neglected diseases found under the Sun
it can be both exhilarating and
cosmically terrifying but if we stay in
the comforts of our own community within
these confines of our own ideologies we
stand to lose so much so nerves be
damned I persist and after all I mean
isn&#39;t that part of what exploration is
all about the act of exploring and
discovering something about the young
even if it means being exposed to risk
my time exploring has encouraged me to
embrace responsible risk-taking and
discover belief systems profoundly
different from my own while some of
these belief systems may seem a little
peculiar it&#39;s important that we sort of
set our culture aside to listen and
learn from these unique voices before
they disappear one practice that I
initially found a little peculiar was a
traditional banking system Vanuatu is
heavily reliant on farming which is why
many communities maintain a barter
economy supplemented with traditional
money such as strings of seashells red
mats and pig tusks much like here in
Australia where you might go to the bank
to deposit a cheque in certain
communities in Vanuatu you would go to
the bank to deposit your string of
seashells or your pig tusks such as the
one I am wearing now this practice may
seem a little outdated or even archaic
in our billion dollar cash economy but
is it let&#39;s consider what happened in
the global financial crisis in Greece
essentially a lack of trust in banks led
people to try and withdraw their money
only to find that their money wasn&#39;t
there
perhaps our banks can learn a thing or
two from this not so archaic system we
can also learn a lot about effective
stewardship policy on mile island elders
noticed a decline in their island&#39;s fish
catch so in an effort to ensure future
access to the islands main protein
source elders placed an unequivocal
temporary ban on fishing with
punishments for non-compliers as severe
and ironic as being fed to the Sharks so
this all of these indigenous knowledge
and wisdom brought to light through
exploration can challenge our Western
wisdom limitations and contribute to our
collective well-being so yes
gone are the days where explorers are
rewriting terra incognita
but that does not mean that exploration
is in conflict with modernity today
exploration is about increasing our
knowledge and understanding of the world
we live in
while the opportunities for modern
exploration are endless there is a time
pressure indigenous voices are
increasingly being silenced amid a
whirlwind of conflict and globalization
and with every one of these worldviews
that fades every culture that disappears
no matter how seemingly remote or
extraneous so too does our repertoire of
wisdom to the common challenges that
face us all the cure for cancer could be
found in some little-known plant
endangered by deforestation who knows
what secrets lie in our ocean steps and
don&#39;t even get me started on space the
next great age of exploration is just
beginning and I hope you all will join
me thank you
