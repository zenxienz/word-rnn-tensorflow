so can I ask everyone here to have your
cell phone on your hands and check your
battery charge how much battery charge
do you have right now let me tell you
something the second happiest moments of
our life after the moment we find true
love is the moment that our cell phone
says fully charged it just feels so good
you feel ready and good to go but now
what if I told you that your life is
dependent on your battery charge your
life is at a greater risk as the battery
charge goes down I know this doesn&#39;t
sound to be true but this is actually
true for millions of patients around the
globe who have cardiac pacemaker cardiac
pacemakers are implantable by electronic
devices that monitor and regulate your
heartbeats these devices have saved
millions of lives around the globe
however cardiac pacemakers are powered
by batteries and this caused three main
problems the first those batteries run
out of charge
so the patient has to go through a
surgery after five to seven years to
replace the battery this exposes the
patient&#39;s to risk of infection and all
the headache that come from any surgery
actually there is a patient
his name was Omar Omar was 11 years old
kids he was happy and full of joy but
when the time comes he went to the
surgery and unfortunately complications
happened
and Omar lost his life and when you
think about it the most precious thing
on earth the human life is lost because
the battery charge is not enough this is
unfair this is unfair so the second
problem that
happening from the battery these
batteries are composed of toxic
electrode materials and electrolytes
which could be very dangerous if any
leakage happen inside the patient&#39;s body
due to an accident or maybe a bad
manufacturing and the third problem they
are bulky so they made the whole
pacemaker bulky actually 40 to 50
percent the size of the pacemaker is a
battery to make the base maker smaller
we need a smaller battery and to find
solution for these serious problems this
is when my research comes in my research
is focused on developing the alternative
which is called biological super
capacitor what is a super capacitor a
super capacitor is an energy storage
device it&#39;s like batteries has a
positive electrode and negative
electrode and these electrodes store the
energy and these are separated with a
membrane then this membrane is a porous
membrane and it also have an electrolyte
what&#39;s the electrolyte electrolyte is a
material that it&#39;s full of ions that and
these ions are important when we do a
charge and discharge without going to
the technical details this is a super
capacitor but why it&#39;s any better super
capacitors can be charged in a very
short amount of time it has a high
charge rate basically you can charge a
super capacitor to the maximum in few
seconds and to show you all this let me
do this demonstration my son loved it so
this is a simple electrical circuit an
example of a super capacitor is here a
small device and it&#39;s connected to a
small lamp we call it LED or a LED lamp
now the charr the device has no charge
so the lamp is off so let&#39;s charge this
super capacitor for just three seconds
so now I disconnected the device I will
connect it to a battery to charge it
and once I connect the other side let&#39;s
count to three together 1 2 3 amazing
audience so now believe it or not this
device now is fully charged and to show
this let&#39;s connect it back to their LED
lamp once they connect the negative side
now you can see the lamps on so why this
is important the whole point is we want
to harvest the energy from the body and
we want something that can suck up all
this energy in very short amount of time
and this is what a super capacitor do
but now we want to design a super
capacitor that solves these problems and
this super capacitor is made from
biocompatible components it&#39;s made from
our body proteins when it&#39;s interlayer
with graphene and this material that we
found by accident happen to charge very
very quickly and store high amount of
charge so we think this material is good
but now these electrolytes that happen
in all the batteries they are toxic so
we use the blood of the patient himself
as an electrolyte our blood is full of
ions which make it the perfect
electrolyte the first time I made the
device with the blood as an electrolyte
I connected to the LED lamp and it goes
on this was a moment of joy I was
dancing everywhere in the lab if you saw
me this time you&#39;d say this guy must
have discovered electricity but now we
know we have a safer device but we want
to make it smaller so we made the device
to be ultra thin it&#39;s actually thinner
than the human hair about one point one
micron not only this we want to test the
device
performance so we charged and discharged
the device for thousands and thousands
of cycles and that performance was
maintained so it&#39;s a durable device this
may this means that this device could
power the cardiac pacemaker for the
lifetime of the patient now we want to
use this device for all other
applications we want to harvest the
energy of the body our motion the body
heat using an energy harvester and this
energy harvester is a layer of the
device that sends the energy to the
super capacitor and now the super
capacitor can power all kinds of
implantable devices not only cardiac
pacemaker gastric stimulators deep brain
stimulators and all kinds of implantable
biosensors devices like this could make
a difference we actually use the device
to power a portable cancer bio sensor
that can detect three cancer biomarkers
all in the same time in a very short
amount of time in a cost less than a
dollar and a half devices like this
could be a game-changer and now let&#39;s
make sure that all the hearts like
Omar&#39;s never run out of charge thank you
[Applause]
you
