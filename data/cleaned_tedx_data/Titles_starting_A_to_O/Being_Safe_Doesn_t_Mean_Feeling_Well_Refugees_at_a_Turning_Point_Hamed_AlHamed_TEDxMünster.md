my name is Hamid before I start I would
like to ask question who if you have a
friends
hands up don&#39;t be so sure
yeah all of us but who of you has a roof
eg friend not all of us
so refugees so look like I am refugee I
came from Syria so may think I&#39;m a
problem but let me tell you why I could
be a part of solution I would like to
share my thoughts my ideas for a new way
living together in a world had changed a
lot in recent years to find out
something good and useful in a time of
war and painful turning points when the
civil war in Syria got worse my brother
and I decided like many others to get
out of the complicated situation and
escape from the war zone we lost our
house and our daily life almost every
respect - I&#39;m 27 years old
but sometimes I feel myself more
traveling over the sea crossing the
borders at night finding away from a
darkness through a darkness that was a
very hard decision we did a film for our
journaling we didn&#39;t believe even if we
will arrive safe we thought it could be
just a memory in 2015
19th October we arrived it to Germany
six days talk our journey from Tokai to
Germany we were so tired but we were
happy that we arrived safe it was
overwhelming I can still remember it was
at a rainy day actually to feel yourself
follow it and wanted it could be a
reason of many to leave your home and
family we live now in a counter sight
nice place quiet good for relaxing and
chilling and there you see a lot of a
green color this color doesn&#39;t make me
happy
as before there actually we tried our
best to integrate ourselves and this new
community we tried to learn the German
language overall but to feel yourself
your self safe doesn&#39;t mean you feel
well living together in one room
with five people sharing the toilet with
30 countryside where no young life the
young people move it already to cities
after they finish it their schools
having like this start was really a
paralyzing protein war and family still
in mind we already don&#39;t have much
contact with our family Jews the
situation in Syria the only channel to
keep in a contact with you&#39;ll love it
once whatsapp and Facebook sometimes we
can&#39;t hear each other good but it was
actually nice at least we know that the
family still alive at the beginning some
people came to us and it was really nice
that they helped at the people in
distress
they had like a new home in a hand but
the other hand fear for the culture and
worry from the growing number of
refugees and the other the other
backgrounds the sitting long time of
doing nothing timing of a process makes
your experience limited makes you also a
good target and an easy prey for Isis we
tried to get contact with the people and
that was actually all what we need
but the only place that you can get in a
contact with a German people was the
market place the only place that you can
see people moving their selves it was
really hard after seven months after we
arrived it to Germany after a lot of
trying to integrate our service in this
community to get an official Doge course
to take a place officially in George
Korres in our only and our only school
in the area which it was so quiet and
stop talking German stop talking English
and start speaking German without
contact after one here I get an answer
that I am NOT allowed to stay in this
country anymore I have to leave Germany
Dublin agreement I tried my best
like many others to make a best
integration that Germany accepted me and
that I am NOT just a number I tried to
take attention from the people then now
I don&#39;t have a real personal ID card
I still using F for a piece of paper and
yeah I still feeling myself as a number
or after nearly two years he helped ya s
key shaft he had the urgent
if you had miss xia good integrate each
father head intact understood the hint
when i need to hook to my announce
balloon is my house belonged here
administer involve ik alice media
english delta when you live in a country
site you have always to think about your

bus the last one at 7:45 and there is no
train to get you back and i can do more
i can give you the solution please don&#39;t
let the people alone
make them active keep them in a contact
with you all of us need a people to talk
me to share exchange our experience our
fear the sitting of doing nothing and
waiting it&#39;s unbelievable just what we
wanted and needed someone come to us and
saying hello this smile can let you
forget a lot you are already not allowed
to bring your family members to germany
you are alone but maybe you can have new
family do you like seeing your food
maybe we can we can cook together
cooking see your food and yeah I don&#39;t
like boggle
we should talk to each other we should
keep in a contact we should help each
other in this new community we should
really accept each other our problem no
matter no matter which color we are
black and white no problem love and hope
is our solution thank you
[Applause]
