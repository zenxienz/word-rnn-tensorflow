the wealth of my nation is not from the
oil or from the buildings that reach the
sky or how much land we have it is from
my people this was a quote by the late
Sheikh Zayed bin Salman and him he was
one of the most inspirational people
that this country has ever seen
and in fact the world but he inspired
someone that is so dear to me and that
was my late grand grandfather I&#39;ve met
soap on an enema and Fred he&#39;s always
telling me I&#39;m era you have to be a
voice and not an echo so I hope today
you will enjoy with me as I take you
through my journey where I learned how
to be a voice and not an echo I spent a
large part of my life in the United
States but my heart and my soul was in
Marathi and it still is still today I
had so much respect for my culture and
my people that I couldn&#39;t wait to come
back and start working in this amazing
nation I graduated with a master&#39;s in
criminology and I returned with
enthusiasm and curiosity but I never
realized how different I was until I
actually started working in the UAE I
worked in a government agency in the
early 2000s and we were discussing
various chemical compositions of
substances and one of my colleagues
whether unaware or he just didn&#39;t know
the answer had written the wrong
chemical composition on the screen so I
looked at him and I raised my hand
really quietly and I said sir you&#39;ve put
the wrong chemical composition could you
please change it or if you want I&#39;ll get
up and I&#39;ll change it his response to me
and my other female colleague shocked us
he told me that women only speak when
they&#39;re spoken to so if anybody knows my
my behavior my my mannerisms I was like
what did you just say to me
but I also understood what he meant
because he came from a different
ideology he told me
Romero you&#39;re going to burn more bridges
than you create with this Western
mentality of yours and your academic
superiority and I felt hurt and
embarrassed because that&#39;s not what I
wanted I wasn&#39;t there to embarrass him I
was there to explain and I was there to
showcase my ability as a person I
understand now why a lot of people
around the world
leave the jobs they love or things that
they are good at as a criminologist
there wasn&#39;t a lot of Amati
criminologists in the early 2000s but I
couldn&#39;t stay in this job I still felt I
had a lot to learn and I still thought I
could add value so I joined another
company it was called Dubai Development
and Investment Authority today it&#39;s
called by holding it was located in
Emirates Towers on the 31st floor now
Emirates Towers is home to a lot of
government agencies it&#39;s also home to a
lot of foreign companies it&#39;s a it was a
great bustling area in the early 2000 it
still is still today but in the early
2000s that&#39;s when that place was
happening and I was on the 31st floor I
have I had a boss who I respect
immensely till today but he used to tell
me every single morning are made are the
only reason you are here is because
you&#39;re in Marathi I know but I used to
you know I was young so when he used to
tell me that it used to I used to take
it to heart today I have more confidence
but at that time I was really upset and
I thought this is this is mean so one
day I started crying
and I was sitting at my dad
and I started crying now before I finish
my story there&#39;s a twist to it as I was
crying a voice asked me in Arabic why
are you crying my child Emirates Towers
was home to a lot of government entities
and a lot of foreign corporations it was
also the home and office of chef
Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum so when I
looked up my first reaction was of shock
and embarrassment as you ladies in the
audience will know what happens when you
cry and you wear mascara my whole face
was covered in black and I thought this
is the first time I&#39;m meeting the ruler
of my nation and this is the look that
he&#39;s going to look at so I worked up the
courage after wanting to jump off the
31st floor and I
I told him my story his answer to me is
something that stayed with me and has
stayed with me till today when I told
him that every day they tell me I&#39;m a
Marathi and that&#39;s the only reason I
have my job he told me well it&#39;s true
you are here today because your Emirati
where else in the world can a person get
a job because of their nationality they
have to go through so many processes but
remember this you are here today because
of you not your passport not who brought
you here because of you tomorrow your
expertise and how hard you work and how
hard you&#39;d say dedicated one day you
will run a department and you will do
that because you deserve it that really
stood with me in 2010 I was sitting with
a bunch of my nationals
we were getting training from a very it
was a very prestigious foreign company
but I noticed that my my nationals or
not engaging and I wasn&#39;t sure why so I
asked one of them and I said why are you
not engaging with the trainer and they
said when I may know we don&#39;t feel a
connection to this trainer we don&#39;t feel
comfortable listening to him or he
doesn&#39;t understand the Emirati culture
and one of them joked it might have been
better if you stood up there Ameri and
you gave the training that made me think
and I said I have to do more for my
nation as I remember Jim Hamid&#39;s words
and I said if I&#39;m going to add value if
I&#39;m going to bridge the gap between
different cultures between men and women
between young and old I have to come up
with a solution I have to bridge that
gap where we don&#39;t judge each other and
we work together to build this nation so
I set up a company called a LF
administration where we train and
develop URI nationals but what set us
apart was a funny story when I went to
actually apply for my license and I went
to chef Emmett&#39;s establishment for young
business leaders and I knocked on the
door and I said you know I have an idea
and I want to open a training company
and the relationship manager told me
well I don&#39;t know if this is such an
exciting idea so you know when you buy a
toy and you think like okay this toy is
broken can I return it so I went up to
the receptionist and I was like can I
return my relationship manager I want
someone else and they were like no
you&#39;re stuck with this one so I said
okay so it&#39;s feeling very upset and I
went to my father and I said I don&#39;t
understand what&#39;s wrong with this person
I want to open a training company so my
father who&#39;s the voice of reason was
like well Amero what will set your
training company apart from all the
other training companies we have in the
UAE and I said you have a point so today
we&#39;ve decided we will only train you in
nationals
we will only work with companies that
develop you in nationals
because we
want them to work together with other
cultures we want other cultures to
understand what is a Marathi culture and
we want mo hotties to understand what
its other cultures so that each together
can add value and they cannot just be
considered amortization quotas well we
have another angle I got divorced I&#39;m a
single mother I was a single mother of
twins and younger girls to three girls
and I was sitting with my grandmother
and my mom in my aunt
we&#39;re like the Golden Girls of the UAE
you know together and my mom said I made
a your your story is not finished
you have a voice you need to do
something else you need to help you need
to inspire women of the UAE as well so
we opened up a part of our company a
branch a humanitarian angle where we
helped divorced and widowed women from
all over the UAE we empower them to get
jobs we teach them we get them training
skills we allow them to go to the
workforce we we give them computers and
Printers if they want to stay at home in
to freelance we make sure that they are
not victims because we&#39;re not victims we
are all working towards one goal and
that is to be part of this amazing
amazing country that we live in I am so
honored and so thankful to be in front
of all of you today and I see such an
amazing mix of nationalities and I&#39;m so
proud that you have called you by your
home today I might be a leader that is
asking a lot of questions but I&#39;m
training the next generation to find all
the answers
my name is amerifat opal Emma and Aleya
Tremec yeah Damon because of you today
I&#39;m a voice and I&#39;m not an echo and I
hope that I make you proud and I hope I
made all of you proud today thank you
