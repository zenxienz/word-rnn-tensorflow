so when you were born into this world
the first thing that you did to
communicate with the outside world was
sound and movement and over time what
starts get hot what starts happening is
you are overshadowed by cognitive
reasoning analytical thinking social
conditioning and you start getting
further and further away from your
primal self so right now all of you for
two seconds just hummed and move your
hands without any kind of influence or
plan and I could see that all of you
were laughing and really enjoyed
yourself did you not yes all right so
what happens is over time as we grow
older and older and we start going to
school and we start learning how to
behave and how to sit and how to stand
and how to walk we start getting further
and further away from our true primal
self so if you look before the evolution
of language cavemen used the arts or art
to describe everything art was used to
describe issues of oppression issues of
community they used art to describe
their daily lives
they used art to show fear to show
solidarity community and art was even
used for tribes to kind of find a way to
identify themselves so there was a lot
of identity and self-expression
where art was concerned and there was no
prerequisite and there was no key
Machado Akasaka wookie name it&#39;s
whatever is naturally coming is art for
all of us even if you look at sound
prayers or chants or mantras that have
been with us for centuries and centuries
if you break it down are essentially
sound vibrations and these sound
vibrations represent the divine or
represent God and that eventually gets
manifested into becoming something of a
reality so I&#39;m sure you all hear key if
you pray and pray and pray and you put
your mind along with your prayer
something&#39;s actually manifest so if you
break it down sound vibrations actually
have a lot of power in this regard the
shamans or the medicine men many years
ago they used sound and movement to
actually heal people there were no
medicines and drugs and everything out
there around that time they just used
the sound of the drum and movement and
they believed that by alleviating
traumas of the mind or the soul a
physical body could actually have
balance and wholeness so healing was
done from the mind and the soul to the
body now let&#39;s fast forward many many
many years later and we&#39;re now in the
1900s and the 1900s the pharmaceutical
industry has completely gone
skyrocketing billions and billions of
dollars are spent every day in
researching new advancements in science
new cures new vaccinations new mutations
and it&#39;s amazing how we&#39;ve developed
ourselves in this field but my only
humble plea would be is if we spent even
2% of those billion dollars in actually
researching our own ancient practices of
healing and methods that our ancestors
used while they sat on this wealth of
knowledge that is being completely lost
in today&#39;s society so along with the
allopathic industry you also have these
other huge industries like the marketing
industry the beauty industry which is
taking us very very far away from the
primal cells that we actually are the
ideals of beauty are all extremely fake
and extremely unreasonable and we must
not get very swayed by such kinds of
thoughts
so little later on in the 1900s and
about 1930 after the Great Depression
the Second World War happened and people
really needed an avenue to kind of break
through and find some sort of sense of
expression
so people were shattered and they were
traumatized by what had happened after
the war they saw millions of people
dying they saw such violence they could
not even speak about what was happening
in their lives they were so traumatized
and this is where art came back into our
lives as a form of medicine so after the
world war in rehabilitation centers in
mental health hospitals in normal
hospitals people started valuing art
again because art was a means for people
to start communicating the kind of
trauma that they had witnessed because
words could not describe what they had
witnessed here are some of the images
from the Second World War where people
used art to talk about what their
feelings were soon after this in the
1960s people were still looking for an
avenue to break through and release the
kind of oppression that they were going
through and in 1960 there were these
famous modern dancers called Martha
grayham Isadora Duncan and many others
who said that dance is not only
choreography people should dance out
their own feelings so as a result of
what started happening they rejected the
very strict ballet rules where
everything had to be perfect and
everything had to be stylized and they
said no let&#39;s use dance and movement to
actually express how we feel and this is
where movement and dance started being
accepted as a means to self Express
I have a quick video clip to show you in
one of my sessions this is a bunch of
women and this is to give you an idea of
how dance therapy looks in terms of the
modern dance kind so they&#39;ve just spoken
about their names and then they&#39;ve been
asked to put their names in through
movement and the lady in the white kurta
is actually the one who&#39;s the main
dancer and she is performing out the
meaning of her name without planning it
so there&#39;s no choreography there&#39;s
nothing her name happens to be Kamla
which means the lotus flower and this is
the feeling that she is associated with
her name and she&#39;s just expressing and
dancing out the emotions attached to her
name so dance therapy is used for all
kinds of populations all of us sitting
in this room will benefit from dance
therapy along with you know you have
people on wheelchairs you have people
who have illnesses but while I was
training to be a dance therapist I
realized that you could have some kind
of physical deformity or some kind of
trauma that&#39;s stored in the body which
actually affects your therapeutic
relationship so as a therapist if I had
to speak to one of my patients and if my
patient was completely locked inside the
path inside their bodies dance might not
be my answer for me to get through them
so I came across this field called
expressive art therapy which not only
used dance will use anything expressive
that can tell your own true story that
can help you listen to your own inner
voice because from when we were kids to
when we are now that little inner child
within us has been so suppressed that we
do not have any chance for any time to
actually listen to our own inner
voice so expressive arts therapy uses as
I said anything like dance drama clay
puppets figurines toys anything that
could be used to tell your story and
what&#39;s amazing about this work is that
it&#39;s spontaneous nothing is meant to be
planned the moment you have a planned
step or the moment you&#39;re copying
somebody or the moment you&#39;re doing
something with some kind of influence
it&#39;s not therapy therapeutic is when you
and your body and yourself are there in
it spontaneously so expressive arts
therapy works with everybody there&#39;s a
picture of me with some children I work
with in Delhi who have cerebral palsy
and autism and this was during a
Christmas play that we directed with
them and it&#39;s really powerful to see how
children such as these who can&#39;t really
use verbal language they are they are
born with certain kind of special
abilities but for them to be in a social
school setting and to be able to perform
like other highly cognitively
functioning children and stuff so for
them using expressive arts therapy
essentially is very valuable because
they find meaning in their lives they
find a way to communicate with the
others and essentially they feel
extremely extremely happy because they
have got some sort of self-respect and
self-esteem
so in expressive arts therapy when you
have a bunch of people a lot of times
people are stuck with some kind of
judgments or stereotypes that oh if I
dance like this how will I be viewed or
if I paint I can&#39;t paint like MFO Sen so
a lot of the arts today is completely
controlled by commercial viability and
all of us feel that if we cannot sell
our art we are not artists but in my
opinion that&#39;s very very wrong all of us
are born with a primate
an innate ability to be creative and we
must not let that hamper our existence
this is a picture of a girl who used
clay and she made her own little secret
garden and every time she wanted to be
herself or she wanted to kind of let go
of some kind of emotion she would go to
a secret garden and find her solace and
peace this is another lady I worked with
and she was asked to describe an inner
conflict that she was going through
using clay and again this is not a
planned activity in the sense where she
just starts playing with clay and over
time she made this image and while
talking about her work she realized that
she actually has body image issues and
after she did this expressive art
activity she was able to start talking
about it and come to terms with what she
was going through so expressive art
therapy also works very well with any
kind of illness and any kind of disease
and people recovering from it so here
you have a picture of a cancer patient
survivor on the right-hand side you can
see that she&#39;s drawn the inner Tom
turmoil and and the inner cells and her
chemotherapy and what her body has gone
through and the left side it&#39;s her
external influence of the world around
her so when you go through a kind of
disease such as cancer there&#39;s a lot
that you&#39;re going through internally for
yourself and the way the outside world
views you and how you have to deal with
people is another added stress so this
is a way for her to describe her inner
and outer external influences and I
would work with her to actually find a
way to merge because as the shamans
believed that if you find balance and
wholeness you find healing and recovery
so this is some pictures of how
expressive art therapy works music
therapy you have a lady who&#39;s finding
strength and hope and on the Left
somebody who
made a mask to describe what she&#39;s gone
through internally and what she feels on
the external aspect this is another lady
who I know very well who&#39;s a cancer
survivor
and she has used art to try and find and
channelize healing lights to come within
her body and she named this darkness to
light and she really really used art in
her journey of recovery to help her feel
whole again
this pictures a quick example to show
you how even magazines and just simple
things that we see everyday in our daily
lives could be used to our advantage if
we are telling our own personal stories
so this lady over here has taken a bunch
of magazine photographs and has put
elements of her life and has told her
the story through magazines this is a
picture of a girl I worked who had
severe depression and when she was asked
to work with toys and figurines and she
made this she then realized and started
speaking about how big how big of a
problem it was at her parents favored
her younger sister more than they
favored her and the positioning of her
being a little far away from her parents
was what we talked about because she
felt very neglected and issues like this
also come up a lot in expressive art
therapy because essentially in
expressive art therapy it&#39;s your own
inner subconscious that is being heard
it&#39;s these small subtle things that you
live in your daily daily life but you
never actually like accept it or talk
about it or do anything about it you
quietly suppress it and just keep living
your daily life and in my opinion when
you suppress your emotions it can lead
to disease so let&#39;s not try and keep
anything inside us let&#39;s all find a time
to express ourselves let&#39;s pick up
crayons pick up art art materials do
whatever it needs to do
but don&#39;t keep emotions pent up inside
so the way art is taught in schools
today is in my opinion very wrong art is
very logically based it&#39;s very Theory
driven art is meant to be a journey it&#39;s
meant to be a process today we are
judged by how skillful we are by trying
to adhere to some kind of aesthetic form
but if I was doing an expressive art
therapy session and I felt like doing
dots or scribbles or splashing paint on
my paper that should be okay and that&#39;s
what our children in today&#39;s education
system should be exposed to they are
sitting there in class and the teacher
has complimented their neighbour for
drawing a good painting and they have
decided that they can never ever paint
for the rest of their lives because they
are not good artists because nobody has
said Mita both echad rock out there and
that&#39;s not happened to you you spend the
rest of your life believing that you
should never ever pick up a paint or
never pick up a crayon because that&#39;s
not what you&#39;re going to be in terms of
your career but that&#39;s not my point my
point is take our time introspect think
express because all of us need that
little self-love so there&#39;s this new
disorder called
ADHD which is become very very popular
in today&#39;s schools so a lot of
psychologists and counselors are
actually diagnosing little children with
ADHD and ADHD stands for attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder when a
child is very impulsive and they&#39;re very
intensive and they&#39;re fidgety all these
things are what normal young babies do
all children are inattentive and they&#39;re
fidgety but there&#39;s a very thin line
which makes somebody a little more
extreme and counselors and psychologists
want to drug these children and they
want to give them something called
Ritalin so that their behaviors and
their
personalities are suppressed Thomas
Edison was thrown out of school in the
third grade on the grounds of being
fidgety inattentive or slow he had ADHD
if it wasn&#39;t for Thomas Edison all of us
would not be blessed with a light bulb
in our homes
imagine if he were drugged and is in his
creativity was suppressed do you know
who else has ADHD you&#39;ll be shocked to
know Albert Einstein had ADHD Will Smith
Jim Carrey Michael Phelps the founder of
Ikea
the founder of JetBlue I mean the list
is endless today we live in a world
where our creativity needs to be honored
our true authentic self needs to be
expressed gone are the days where we can
live our lives in silence there&#39;s a very
beautiful story that I heard from Sir
Ken Robinson stalk and there was a girl
in a classroom who&#39;s making a drawing
and the teacher asked this little girl
what are you drawing and she says I&#39;m
drawing God so the teacher says but
nobody knows what God looks like and the
little girl looks at the teacher and she
says well they&#39;ll know in a minute so
this is the kind of things that children
of today can be teaching us and this is
the kind of platform that we need to be
giving our future generations every
child is born an artist in the words of
Pablo Picasso the only problem is
remaining one as we grow up thank you
