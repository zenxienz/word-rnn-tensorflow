I wish I rocked better at memorization
as I&#39;m using my notes in 2008 I arrived
on Hilton Head not knowing anyone but my
mom who had retired here after a 30
career through two-year career in
education I media identified with the
flourishing music scene here on the
island guys like Martin Les and Joe
Vickers playing Knightley around the
island I had no idea how to infiltrate
this thing not having knowing anyone or
any relationship to anyone involved this
is a tight-knit group of guys very
talented musician and I decided to do my
best on my own time to get recognition
for my previous endeavors and do my best
to help the scene expand I wanted to be
recognized for my own achievements and I
wanted Hilton Head to be recognized as a
place to come see amazing live music in
the mid 20th century Abraham Herold
maslul an American psychologist created
something called Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of
needs if you&#39;re unfamiliar with Maslow&#39;s
hierarchy of needs it goes like this
all humans have essential needs that
must be met through the course of their
development and these two tiers the
social need to belong and the need for
confidence and essentially respect are
obtained through the recognition from
fellow employees peers family etc so
it&#39;s pretty simple we as humans have the
need to be recognized in order to
succeed humans need some of these basic
emotions to fulfill their purpose here
on planet earth humans aren&#39;t that
different from a business in the sense
that a successful business is one that
achieves recognition which gives the
business the tools and strengths to
succeed the definition of success
depends you know on the type size
location of such business but regardless
of the size of the company or location
recognition drives profit that profit
may be something more than simply money
it could be awareness about a cause or
event it can be an in
flux in customers or consumers or it
could simply be a bigger audience for
that business or brand specific know-how
within the last 15 years the ability to
become recognized has become one of the
easiest tasks to overcome on february
4th 2004 something happened in a Harvard
dorm room that changed the way the world
shares information for students along
with their ringleader made this thing
and initially it was only available to
students attending Harvard University
this thing now has over 2 billion
monthly users there&#39;s seven point six
billion people in the world give or take
that means that 26 percent of the planet
utilizes this tool on a monthly basis
this thing is called Facebook that
ringleader is Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg
goal was quote driven by a sense of
purpose to connect people and bring us
closer together we are now all connected
if we want to be social media has
allowed anyone anywhere to create
content and receive recognition for what
they create content may be pictures
thoughts or videos of events that happen
and everyone&#39;s daily routine content can
be a picture of a peanut butter sandwich
you just made content might be a video
of your vacation content might be your
views on a political or religious idea
when we put this content into the world
we are now trained to expect a
recognition so much though that we may
initially put content in front of people
that we know they will disagree with we
also put content out that we know people
will like a comment about Affleck
political figure or party is obviously
going to spark conversation a photo of a
newborn baby is obviously going to
receive lots of loving and warm comments
but regardless of what the content is
all content is essentially some sort of
recognition when it&#39;s posted on social
media
and what does that recognition translate
to it means the world&#39;s a smaller place
and Zuckerberg has achieved his goal 20
years ago content was relayed at an
imperceptible pace
it was slow news life events general
thought it took hours days weeks even
years to be recognized on a global scale
that is all changed it is now possible
to upload content to a platform like
Facebook and have hundreds thousands
even millions of people see it within
seconds what does that mean for business
it means your customers and clientele
are a much broader demographic from a
substantially larger school of fish that
have the ability to receive your content
with a push of the button that&#39;s kind of
a mind-blower for me but what separates
good content from bad what&#39;s the
difference in successful recognition of
your company&#39;s product or service versus
negative recognition or even worse no
recognition at all the difference is the
story the content we create individually
or as a business should serve a purpose
and enough reason for us to want to
share it with the world
let&#39;s go back to that picture someone
posted of the peanut butter and jelly
sandwich to start with was the photo a
clear depiction of the sandwich was it
shot in good light with an interesting
angle or a photo edit that made us
interested was the sandwich on homemade
bread with grandmas jelly and freshly
ground peanut butter was it served on a
decadent plate or platter was it made it
one of the most recognized restaurants
in the world you get the idea if it was
a PB&amp;J on a paper plate made with
Smuckers jelly Jif peanut butter on
Wonder Bread sort of just content
without any story no caption no bigger
idea someone else could take that same
content that same picture
and a caption along the lines of two
years lost at sea eating minnows and
seagulls and all I could think about was
a classic PB&amp;J
I was just rescued by the Coast Guard
and this was the first thing I made when
I got home
that&#39;s content with story granted it&#39;s
an extreme idea but you get the picture
sharing content that is depth and
purpose and relative storyline is going
to generate recognition hopefully
positive and rewarding recognition that
either helps your business or at least
gets people interested in what you&#39;re
trying to share the more your business
or brand is recognized the more engaging
your content is to the viewers the
deeper the depth of your story or
purpose this all gives your business and
brand a message a real purpose out there
and all the noise of Facebook social
media etc etc etc when it&#39;s good your
customers and followers will nourish
your story and look for your content
they actually start wanting to know what
you&#39;re doing but maybe you&#39;ve been
sitting there for the past eight minutes
or so saying yourself I don&#39;t care about
Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or
whatever I don&#39;t even have a Facebook
profile every 60 seconds on Facebook
five hundred and ten thousand comments
are posted two hundred ninety three
thousand statuses are updated and a
hundred and thirty six thousand photos
are uploaded every single minute if
you&#39;re a business or individual that
wants to be recognized it matters and
yes it&#39;s amazing that there are that
many engaging and active users but
that&#39;s also a huge amount of information
competing for their attention so quality
and good content and engaging stories
matter Facebook and other facets of
social media have completely changed the
way we do business
it is fueled what I have done for the
past eight years I&#39;m a musician and
documentarian of music in and around the
low country my record label has put out
seven compilation albums featuring
Hilton Head musicians Katy
over a hundred thousand online plays my
band Cranford Hollow has used our
recognition and story to compel
thousands of people to watch us play and
listen to our music
each year we livestream our shows we&#39;re
live streaming this right now we post
snippets of life on the road
we have fund raised thousands of dollars
to make albums while offering listeners
early versions of songs exclusive in
studio video and early releases of
Records we want to be recognized so we
can continue to make music we are
fortunate to live in a community that
supports paying the rent by playing
music however in order to tour on a
national level make albums and get the
shows we need to propel us to the next
step we have chosen to do our best to be
recognized and tell our story and it&#39;s
working a recent single I recorded for
Progressive Insurance was played over
half a million times all over the world
we&#39;ve had over 300,000 live viewers of
our live streaming shows we&#39;ve sold
thousands of records digitally and
physically and we&#39;ve had the opportunity
to give back to the community by raising
over fifteen fifty thousand dollars in
charity last year my business myself as
an individual thrives on recognition our
fans share a content and respond to our
story your business or brand may not be
a musical act but there is definitive
evidence that being recognized online
increases the profitability of what
you&#39;re trying to sell right now wherever
you are there&#39;s an opportunity to tell
your story to share your brand to show
your accomplishments and accolades to
encourage your consumers to feel a
familiarity with you find a common
ground and connection that draws them to
you sometimes some of this feels like
boasting or bragging but that&#39;s the
point
recognizing your own endeavors and
sharing them in a manner that
essentially forces other to recognize
your endeavors as well is the objective
of what you&#39;re trying to accomplish to
hopefully bring success to your business
in the form of brand recognition
and market share and profitability and
connecting to an audience has never been
easier this niche group of online users
who are really into whatever it is
you&#39;re doing will recognize your
ambition they&#39;ll share it comment on it
and buy whatever it is you&#39;re trying to
sell goods services ideas art or all
things you want to sell your recognition
is your story Aristotle said in the
arena of human life the honours and
rewards fall to those who show their
good qualities in action in the arena of
the internet recognition is awarded to
those who tell their story I want to
hear your story and everyone who matters
to you or your company wants to hear you
succeed help yourself by letting your
business or brand be recognized I
appreciate the time you&#39;ve given me to
talk today and I think we all have a
story to tell and by the way in the 12
minutes or so that it took to give my
speech 3,600 new users created Facebook
account 3.5 billion statuses were
updated and over 1 and a half million
photos were posted with all that content
tell me a story more interesting than a
peanut butter sandwich thank you all so
much
[Applause]
