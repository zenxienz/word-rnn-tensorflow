you
name is always the bony around 14 years
old there are about 500,000 homeless
people in the US and every day custom
farther and farther away from society oh
excuse me I was trying not to call
homeless but people experiencing
homelessness to people and just because
they don&#39;t have a home doesn&#39;t mean
there are different species race
religion or color when I was younger I
used to think about random LOI but now I
understand what it&#39;s like to live in the
street for a day if you&#39;re having a bad
day just look at the people on the
street looking in the traffic some
foodie and can&#39;t even sleep because it&#39;s
illegal all I ask is that you give us
some respect to the heartbroken in the
heartless and stop being so selfish
because you probably don&#39;t know what
it&#39;s like to experience homelessness
this goes to all y&#39;all out there that
call me a terrorist all I have to say to
you right now is that you&#39;re racist
actually there&#39;s more I don&#39;t got bombs
in my pocket or a bazooka with a rocket
I&#39;m just looking I&#39;m just a normal kid
looking for a better life to live and
y&#39;all calling me Isis I&#39;m trying to run
away from war in my country I wear her
job and y&#39;all make fun of me this is my
culture this is my religion I don&#39;t walk
around making fun of your traditions
just cuz I don&#39;t care about your
ambitions I&#39;m just trying to get a
better education in this nation and
again this goes to all y&#39;all out there
who call me me me me a terrorist
[Applause]
okay let&#39;s get started today I&#39;m gonna
be presentable live Sorrento cheapo and
it&#39;s called expectations I welcome to
the doors of our brand new school new
people new places new ways to be cool
I barely know anyone still turn up it in
but it&#39;s gonna take some some other
people I&#39;m with first day first class
and the teacher asked me what do you
expect of you all right a pasta think
and in my head I say well I mean I want
to get good grades make new friends make
relationships here that will never end I
want to go to school where I could
follow my dreams
make my mom proud since she could barely
pay the fees I want to graduate from
here you know that I did the best I can
then graduate from college the first in
my family I want to be able to help the
whole wide world
even though where I&#39;m from that just
seems like a joke music has held me
since the day I was born and I want to
give back by helping people who feel
torn when I grow up I&#39;m gonna be the
best but I said this in my head out loud
I said this instead I don&#39;t know what
should I expect
[Applause]
