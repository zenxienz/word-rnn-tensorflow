hi everyone I&#39;m really excited to be
here especially because in my country
it&#39;s typhoon season when I say typhoon I
mean that they&#39;re pretty violent we have
20 of them every how we have 20 of them
that are extremely violent at about 100
km/h but one particular one really was
the darkest moment for me in 2014 was a
typhoon called high on the first super
typhoon to ever hit land 300 kilometers
per hour winds roughly that&#39;s what it
takes for you to take off with the plane
and imagine yourselves trapped on that
imagine a population least prepared for
something of that violence 4 million
houses almost 10 million people died
within 24 hours and it&#39;s in this area
that I was brought but you know we have
a volunteers for disaster where really
we go there to help out to distribute
goods but the roads everything was so
destroyed so 20 feet of sea rose up and
wiped out the city knocking off
electricity it was it was it was pretty
violent no electricity no food and I sat
there and as I said I was saying what
what can one do in such a situation I
was getting deeper and deeper into this
kind of helplessness and next to me of
course you know seated down there was a
there was a teacher from a school there
that was helping out and he took out a
piece of paper to cut a piece of paper
and he put a black dot on it and he says
what do you see I said well the only
thing on it the black dot is what
happens with the white paper and this
was kind of where I began I said what
happens when I&#39;m just looking at my
resources what I can do
but really not thinking what is possible
my resources are not the vision of what
I wanted to do there was help people and
so behind the relief center was this
huge amount of bottles and my job was to
try to see how to restart the schools
get the children out of the tent cities
come together talk about their pain have
played but how could you build schools
the only thing remaining was the roof
everything what else was washed by the
flood and so what we would do is we
started imagining what was possible
waste the bricks would not come for the
next two months we started getting women
filling it up with River mud from the
river that destroyed the city that was
flooded into their houses we started
filling up the bottles then from there
we started saying we don&#39;t have steel
what do we do so chicken is really
popular and so we would get the chicken
feathers and the chicken feathers are
really tough stuff it&#39;s like here
it&#39;s like when you open up a crypt the
only thing is is keratin the hair
there&#39;s nails there&#39;s bones and there&#39;s
hair but when you mix it in cement in
the little cement that we have you can
rebuild this ultra-tough school&#39;s
bottles are 12 inches but 10 of them
when you fill it up you could shoot a
bullet through it or the next typhoon so
that would be whoops sorry that would be
the plastic bottles and this one is sort
of a mystery gin bottles how do you get
gin bottles in a disaster we actually
called out to tell them hey can you
donate the gin with the bottle while we
build schooling you how many people
think that they actually okay anyway
let&#39;s get on but one of the hardest
things was grass how do you get flat
glass it&#39;s already dangerous to go over
paved road and so what we do is every
five bottles we would stick a plastic
bottle of water and this one was his
inspiration we looked around we worked
with other guys and Alfred the master
helped us like he said like when a hole
in a roof travels in a straight line and
you get the dot when you put a plastic
bottle the lights spread so beautifully
that houses light up
you know you will be a kitchen sand but
both specially children will be able to
get a great light in the schools that we
were building the nice thing there is
really we said why not start up from
scratch there&#39;s no electricity it&#39;ll
take a year for lights to come back with
power plants why don&#39;t we build the
first grassroots solar you know a solar
company how does that work women have no
money so during the day we would put the
lights and then they don&#39;t have to turn
on their kerosene lamps you know houses
are so next to each other they don&#39;t
have to put on the fluorescent light the
fluorescent light but then they say five
to ten dollars every month then we built
another camp where the women
cooperatives that lost their job started
we started teaching them to take copper
strips put pencil pen on them and dip it
in ferric acid and what would happen is
we would be able to upgrade with the
savings not that savings to be able to
light those bottles at night then later
on we started saying why not produce
them if the women can produce them they
can rent them so the women that were
making the lights not only they were
they doing it for their household but
later on they were renting it they were
making income in the villages instead of
money going out of the village for
kerosene they were staying in the
village but at the same time they were
becoming economically more sustainable
and what happened they started bringing
in doctors they started buying books so
I saw that investing in the women
cooperatives and giving them power to be
able to empower the village was actually
working in fact they&#39;re now called alone
and tahan and the women are called the
light of the village the next thing we
said is what about the youth everybody&#39;s
there&#39;s so many young people here how
can we get them involved then we started
saying if we can just change the way
that solar is done instead of imported
patented expensive takes 44% of my money
that I raised to fundraising and then it
arrives in that Indian arrives in the
village having gone through ships and
trucks and customs by the time it
reached me
I only have
less than 1/2 percent a half of the
money I&#39;ve ever raced and the worst part
is the fact it&#39;s designed to fail the
batteries are so cheap because it&#39;s so
expensive to move them from across the
world to where I was that they made it
into nickel-cadmium three hours of the
three hours of light and at the same
time in a year&#39;s time it would break so
I said why don&#39;t we shift why don&#39;t we
build kerosene lamps into solar and what
happens is we would have a business
where all the women with already this
kerosene lamps could come to our group
and we can convert them into solar and
then from there when the children would
make it as well so we went to the we
went to the cities and we said don&#39;t
just donate your old clothes don&#39;t just
donate you know water come and help us
light up these villages six hundred
thousand people in every city were
displaced why not convert that into
lights and give it and this made a
really powerful statement not only did
we start up a small solar organization
that we may knew how to fix the light we
may know how to make business out of the
light but more than that they started
spreading it all around the country so
we started making women cooperatives
where we actually had to rent a
Volkswagen to be able to distribute we
started making 5,000 solar lamps by hand
more than what was needed in that
village more than that was needed in the
refugee camps but we were able to light
up several provinces around the country
so we took a van which we which we ran
which we paid for and then we started
selling them around so I realized that
that by by being able to teach women how
to make solar lamps we actually were
onto something we were actually able to
spread this to different communities the
way that we do it is we lend them sort
we loan them the parts so what happens
is we grew group five in each village
and they don&#39;t pay us cash they loan it
together as five of them like Muhammad
Yunus and when they build the lamps and
sell it they pay us back and the same
thing 97
rate and so we would be able to have a
big warehouse instead of cash burning we
would be able to give it to women to be
able to assemble it themselves then we
started going into house lights and
street lights and the nice thing there
is instead of $2,000 it only cost us $50
to be able to build a street light and
what&#39;s nice there is that the the crime
rate in those villages would drop 70%
the most interesting part about this is
the fact that we&#39;ve created a revolution
we started out in the Philippines and
today we&#39;re in 30 countries around the
world from a develop you know from a
tragedy we&#39;re now hitting 1 million
lights around the world I wanted to show
you as the next generation a very
special lamp which basically is the next
generation of what we&#39;re going to do we
found out that only 3 hours of it only
takes 3 hours to charge a street lamp in
the rest of the time it was not really
doing much in the village so the other
you have the phone so what happens now
is we were able to add a Raspberry Pi
Internet as the technologies gotten so
cheap that you can put a Raspberry Pi
inside the streetlights and then you can
connect it to what is now very prevalent
in the developing country $25 cellphones
and what happens there is you&#39;re able to
create electronic libraries that can go
throughout the whole village you can
also communicate with each other across
the village without having you know they
come that they come back and then what
happens is they find out the price of
vegetables or they get some you know
some DVDs okay that&#39;s illegal but you
could actually spread it throughout the
whole village where there&#39;s our
streetlight and how do we put this up so
here you are community built
streetlights that can be fixed because
the parts are local the skills are
turned over and sometimes it&#39;s so
fantastic because we start out with 60
we come back in two years
and they&#39;re 600 but they&#39;re replicable
they can now upgrade so they own their
own electronic library and with their
cell phones they can now check into
education to healthcare into literature
and of course as I said you can they can
now talk in the village without having
to walk to each other let me show you an
interesting interesting in the education
stop this this is actually something
that goes on you&#39;re on your phone so
they can talk about do-it-yourself they
can they can talk about electronic
skills but the nice thing there is they
can also have great books now literature
sorry literature sorry with any
technologies it&#39;s the person using it
that&#39;s the failure see I didn&#39;t blame I
didn&#39;t blame it it but but the nice
thing there is
I just want to say that it&#39;s financial
kind of businesses that are based on the
village if solar cannot be built and
repaired in the village then it&#39;s not
going to be sustainable these kind of
important patented goods are very
expensive and when they break the
business model is for the woman to go
into microcredit to buy it again and
again and again there&#39;s a simple way of
building them that any person can do in
fact if you go out are boost in 30
seconds in 30 minutes we can make you
build a streetlight in 15 minutes we can
make you build I convert a dirty
kerosene lamp into house lights what&#39;s
the market like in my country alone 35
million lanterns can be converted so how
does an idea start from a developing
country and change the world
it&#39;s the power of replication it&#39;s the
power of getting young people around the
world today we have 1400 young solar
engineers going to the provinces
teaching women how to be able to
transform kerosene lamps into solar
Street uh plastic bottles into street
lights and now going to make a libraries
can anyone change the world not the
person alone here but by the strength of
multiplying themselves around the world
and this is the idea that we have
that made it to this page thank you
