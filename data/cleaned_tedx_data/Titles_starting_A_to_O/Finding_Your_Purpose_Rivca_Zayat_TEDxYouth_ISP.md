finding your purpose did you know that
70% of Americans are disengaged in their
jobs according to Forbes calm and did
you know that I was part of that 70% I
was fresh out of college with a
nine-to-five job that was what everyone
else was expecting from me but I was not
happy and I really did not know what the
future will hold for me that being said
how do you see yourselves ten years from
now I know that the images of the future
might seem a bit blurry because we have
a lot of pressure from society from our
peers from our parents and even from
ourselves but this is the reason why it
is so important to find our passion at a
young age good evening ladies and
gentlemen my name is the leaf casaya i
am 24 years old i am a business graduate
entrepreneur self-made healthy chef and
the founder and owner of feed seed the
first healthy bakery established in
panama we have a digital community of
over ninety two thousand people on our
success has been due to our innovative
idea of transforming sweet not so
healthy recipes into healthier ones and
since I love baking and it is my passion
today I&#39;m gonna show you how to bake a
recipe for success and we&#39;ll be needing
three main ingredients we&#39;ll be needing
being healthy eliminating the noise and
focusing on the eye and not the weak so
shall we get started
ingredient number one we have here six
ounces of health and you might say well
what does being healthy have to do with
finding your purpose because here we&#39;re
not talking about being healthy to have
a ripped body the perfect physique no we
are talking about health to achieve
mental clarity
and how do we achieve mental clarity
with three basic things number one
eating nutritiously and I always say
follow the 80/20 rule and why do what do
I mean by this 80% of the time you
should eat foods that nourish your body
that feed your brain for example walnuts
avocado healthy fats food for your brain
carbohydrates energy for your body
proteins whether you&#39;re a vegan
vegetarian beans or regular meat and 20%
of the time you should eat foods that
you love for example cheesecake burgers
hot dogs fries all that food that&#39;s so
tasty because let&#39;s face it food is
amazing and it&#39;s all about finding a
balance because everything in excess
it&#39;s not good either so the second thing
we&#39;ll need to do to find health is
staying active do physical activity fine
find that physical activity that you
love rather than you dread doing be part
of the soccer team the football team I
don&#39;t know blast the music in your room
and dance for 30 minutes do whatever
feels you may that makes you feel alive
do something that makes you sweat every
day and something that you love now the
third thing that we&#39;ll need is sleep and
rest if you have the two above and you
don&#39;t sleep and you don&#39;t rest then you
will burn out and none of the above will
be useful so sleeping and resting is
essential now the positive consequences
of leading a healthy lifestyle
you&#39;ll be focused and you&#39;ll be alert
and keep in mind this quote preparation
meets opportunity you need to be
mentally prepared to understand when
that opportunity comes for you to figure
out what is your goal what is your
purpose now I would like to share a
personal anecdote of mine when I was in
college I was going through a rough
patch I was diagnosed with depression
and I was told that I needed to take
medication for depression and I thought
to myself I don&#39;t want to depend on
medicine in order to be happy I don&#39;t
want to depend on something else to feel
comfort
so I started shifting my habits I
started eating healthier
I started playing sports flag football I
started eating nutritiously I started
sleeping more and at that point in time
I remember that I was given a class in
college called a business and they told
us well you need to come up with a
website for your own company and I was
like whoa this is a really big project
and I had such mental clarity in that
point in my life that one night when I
was about to go to sleep I was thinking
about ideas for the project and suddenly
the idea fit seed let fitness and health
grow popped up in my mind like like
magic and I had the mental clarity to
understand that that project that class
that website was going to be my passion
and what it&#39;s my job right now so we
have in green number one remember being
healthy we need to stay active we need
to sleep and we need to eat nutritious
sleep now ingredient number two four
ounces of eliminating noise here we go
eliminating noise and what do I mean by
eliminating noise well eliminate all the
negativity that is around you you need
to start by making very small changes
eliminate all of those words that are
negative for example I can&#39;t it&#39;s
impossible or I&#39;m never gonna achieve
that I&#39;m too young I&#39;m too old
I don&#39;t have the experience eliminate
all those small things and then you can
progress to eliminate all the other
things like unnecessary situations
unnecessary relationships things that
keep us from evolving and what is the
next step you need to surround
yourselves with people that have the
same aspirations as you do so it can
take you to the next level of finding
your passion if you need to think
positive you need to be proactive and
you need to take action and how are you
gonna do that by being part of something
that is bigger than you maybe be part of
the debate club or be part of the drama
club I know that you were hosting the
Beauty and the Beast here yesterday and
they told me it was amazing so maybe
next year you&#39;re gonna be part of the
play be part of something even bigger
TEDx this event is the living proof that
you can do something even bigger than
yourselves
so the positive consequences of
eliminating all the noise of being
positive is that you will emphasize your
full potential on that which is your
passion in that which is that you love
whether it is as a debater as an idea
creator or as a game changer now
ingredient number three we need 6 ounces
of I and you might say there we go 6
ounces of I you might say well I that
sounds a little selfish but let&#39;s go
back to the concept you need to love
yourself in order to love others and
it&#39;s just that simple concept you need
to make yourself happy you need to
understand what is it that you love in
order to find your true passion and we
are very worried right now about
pleasing others about approval from
society and especially in today&#39;s
generation where happiness is based on
how many likes you have on Instagram how
many shares you have how many retweets
you get but that that is not true
happiness we have a lot of worries about
approval we have a lot of expectations
from our parents our teachers our peers
as I once said but today today is your
wake-up call
stop worrying about what others thinks
and start focusing on what you want but
be careful do not confuse
focus on yourself of course but don&#39;t
confuse being reckless with taking
charge of what you like those are two
really different things and this is why
it is essential and crucial having
mentors whether it is one two three
thirty mentors you need to find people
that guide you towards the right path
that help you answer your own questions
but do not force you into doing things
that you don&#39;t want that don&#39;t force you
into the paths they did but focus on
leading you towards that thing which is
that you love so mentors are going to
help you to transform your abstract
ideas into tangible realities just as a
girl surprised I&#39;m sure they had mentors
mentors will help you go from point A to
point B now we have our ingredients we
need 6 ounces of Health four ounces of
eliminating noise and 6 ounces of AI now
what&#39;s the next step your action plan
but I&#39;m not gonna go into detail about
what your action plan should be because
each and every action plan once again
it&#39;s different we all should look for
different things in order to achieve our
final purpose so I would like to make a
comparison here an action plan is just
like a recipe you have three main
ingredients which are sugar flour and
eggs and you know you want to bake a
cake you want it initially to be a
carrot cake but you still don&#39;t know if
you have the ingredients so you need to
use your creativity in order to bake a
cake not a perfect cake but a pretty
damn good tasty and delicious cake so
today I do not have carrots but I see
here I have chocolate so let&#39;s bake a
chocolate cake which I&#39;m sure it will
turn out amazing
so lives is just like a recipe we have
we need to have pillars to
have discussed three mailers being
positive being healthy loving yourself
focusing on yourself eliminating the
noise you know you have a purpose but
you still don&#39;t know quite yet how
you&#39;re gonna get to your final
destination and this part the unknown
part of going from point A to point B is
where you need to play with the
situations
life presents to you but without losing
your overall goal or the sight of your
overall goal now as human beings we&#39;re
all impatient it doesn&#39;t matter how old
we are how young we are how much
experience we have we want things to
happen now but let&#39;s compare life to
baking once again life is like baking a
cake you need to bake your cake 25
minutes at 350 degrees if you put it
less time at a higher temperature what
will happen your cake will burn life is
just like that it&#39;s about enjoying the
process it&#39;s about learning from your
mistakes enjoying the good times until
you get to your ultimate goal so keep in
mind preparation meets opportunity
remember to be mentally prepared I have
given you the tools to be mentally
prepared to understanding when that
opportunity maybe it&#39;s a project maybe
it&#39;s a speech you heard maybe it&#39;s a TED
talk you heard maybe it&#39;s a million
things but be prepared to understand
what is that thing that is your passion
so do you want to be part of that 70%
that is disengaged in their jobs
that&#39;s not happy that does not want to
go to work or do you want to be part of
that 30% that is happy that it&#39;s
cheerful that is entrepreneurial
I have a better idea let&#39;s make that 30
percent growth left shift the paradigm
today right now we are the generation in
charge of taking things to the next
level of being proactive of taking
action so let&#39;s lift that 30% to a
hundred percent let&#39;s be that generation
and let&#39;s start baking
[Applause]
