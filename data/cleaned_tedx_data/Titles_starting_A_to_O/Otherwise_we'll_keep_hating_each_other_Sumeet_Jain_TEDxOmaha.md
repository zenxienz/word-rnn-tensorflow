I believe we&#39;re in the midst of a crisis
of understanding we don&#39;t understand
each other in this country very well
when we talk about important subjects I
found that we often have a tendency to
push ourselves further away then bring
ourselves together and it&#39;s the hardest
thing to do with it but it&#39;s so
important part of the problem is
definitions when I was a kid
racism meant anytime you do something
bad to somebody else because of their
race but that definition has changed
today it is a new definition that says
it&#39;s impossible to be racist to a white
person you can be prejudiced against
white people you can discriminate
against white people but you can&#39;t be
racist to a white person and language is
important and our words have power but I
think we have to ask ourselves how
important this particular definitional
debate is because other things are
important - I&#39;ve seen this definitional
debate derail other conversations that
would also have been important the other
day somebody posted on Facebook a story
about themselves they had been hurt by
some prejudice and they happened to be
white but they shared this story on
Facebook and the responses zeroed in on
the fact that they had used the word
racist in the post this person shared
vulnerably a story about them being hurt
by something and the responses were a
critique of their language and I feel
like there&#39;s a point at which we&#39;ve
stopped being empathetic in the way that
we would reply and I&#39;m I&#39;m worried about
it but it&#39;s also important to ask
ourselves why people like me fight for
this new definition of racism and part
of it is that this new definition of
racism takes into account white
privilege but that&#39;s another
definitional quandary I haven&#39;t really
seen a lot of good explanations of white
privilege either some conversations of
white privilege go something like this
one person says there&#39;s no such thing as
white privilege are you kidding me
you&#39;re telling me that some poor white
kid has more privileged than Colin
Powell&#39;s child and then the reply is
usually a long comp
cated summary of critical race theory it
doesn&#39;t go particularly well it&#39;s not
coherent and it&#39;s also not what that
conversation needs to be it shouldn&#39;t be
academic it should be personal and it
should be relatable we have to decide if
we would rather be right or if we would
rather be persuasive being right is
easier but it&#39;s also nebulous because
you can&#39;t prove it it&#39;s not scientific
over time
truth itself has changed drastically for
human society we used to think the world
was flat at any point in time we could
be wrong and we won&#39;t even know about
that until hundreds of years after were
dead being persuasive is testable its
scientific if you want to know whether
or not you were persuasive just ask the
person you were speaking to
hey did I persuade you and then you know
but it&#39;s harder being persuasive
requires us to understand the person
that we&#39;re talking to an understanding
requires compassion and patience and
listening to them even when listening to
them makes our blood boil some of the
ways that we talk about white people
today it&#39;s like we think they&#39;re
invulnerable like nothing we say could
harm them so we can say anything and if
it does run them good they deserved it
but white people are not invulnerable to
the poor white parent who can&#39;t afford
to take their sick kid to the hospital
the idea of white privilege is insulting
and confusing unless it&#39;s explained well
they don&#39;t have the time or the will to
extricate privilege of class from
privilege of race all they hear is
you&#39;ve had it easy this whole time and
you still can&#39;t afford to take your sick
kid to the doctor white people are not
invulnerable and they are growing
accustomed to only hearing bad things
about themselves from us that&#39;s big we
all need to hear good things about
ourselves if we don&#39;t find affirmation
from over here we&#39;ll find affirmation
over there and we will ally ourselves
with the people that have affirmed us
and understand us this is why it should
be particularly disturbing to all of us
that the only people who are saying good
things about white people are militants
and supremacists we really need to
prioritize persuasion we also need to
address the American Eagle Americans
don&#39;t like having it easy our heroes
were born and raised in a log cabin that
they built themselves when they were six
years old and they walked uphill both
ways to school in the snow and they read
their books by candlelight and then they
became president
this is the material with which we build
our icons so it makes sense that we&#39;re
so resistant to the idea of privilege
but we have to try to address the
American aversion to privilege part of
it starts with admitting our own
privileges freely and with more humility
I&#39;m exceptionally privileged I also
worked very hard to make a career for
myself and I was lucky and supported by
other people as well all of that
combined means that my kids will be born
into a financially secure household they
will not have to worry about health or
eating well they&#39;ll have fun they&#39;ll
work hard and play hard they&#39;ll travel
and make memories that they later write
about in essays for internship
applications
they&#39;ll have a good start they might
screw it up but they will have a good
start
they won&#39;t have worked for that at all
we&#39;re giving it to them isn&#39;t that what
every parent wants to do don&#39;t parents
want to give their kids the best
sure-footed start that they can
privilege is not something evil to run
away from accepting it can help us to
build some bridges white privilege is
not an attack on any one person it&#39;s not
about comparing one person to another
person or just cherry-picking a poor
white kid and then a rich black kid it
confuses the subject instead I like to
think of white privilege as part of how
we might answer a very complicated
question
and a question is how long does it take
to remedy centuries of oppression white
privilege suggests that it takes longer
than we think in the 1950s the GI Bill
helped people helped veterans coming
back from World War two buy houses and
go to college it&#39;s a tremendous benefit
you can really start to build wealth
with something like that of the first
67,000 mortgages that the GI Bill first
insured less than a hundred were given
to people of color this is also a time
when it was legal for many of the best
universities in the country to deny
admissions to people based on the color
of their skin you can build wealth with
those benefits but they were unequally
distributed some of you should also
realize that this wasn&#39;t that long ago
it&#39;s possible that you have a relative
living today who was denied a mortgage
or university admittance because they
were black how long does it take to
reverse remedy to reverse centuries of
oppression I&#39;m asking you to be open to
the idea that it might take longer than
we thought next month and we&#39;re sitting
around the table at Thanksgiving sharing
blessings as we sometimes do I&#39;d like
you to also consider not just how light
would be if you hadn&#39;t had a particular
blessing but how would things be if your
lineage for hundreds of years had been
denied many of those blessings what is
the impact of a family whose lineage was
affected by that what does it feel like
to them when they sight that inequity
are they heard properly is it hard to
make that kind of a claim and still have
your integrity I might not have
convinced anybody today that white
privilege exists I hope I&#39;ve made at
least a dent in the idea that white
privilege exists did because if we&#39;re
gonna argue and we should argue if we&#39;re
gonna argue let&#39;s argue about how long
it takes to reverse the effects of a
system where white privilege at least
did exist let&#39;s argue about how long it
takes to address the inequality of
unequal rights and benefits unequal
universities unequal suburbs unequal
prison sentences and when we&#39;re arguing
about those things we need to do it
better than we have some of you might be
hearing me and thinking&#39;s to meet how
dare you police my tone how dare you
tell me how to speak about my oppression
and you&#39;re right I can&#39;t do that and I
shouldn&#39;t deny it and I&#39;m not many of
you have taken on this tremendous
emotional burden of speaking about this
at all and I can ask for nothing more
than your courage that you&#39;ve already
provided but some of you are like me you
know racism firsthand but you are also
privileged to have had it easier than
some of you and of myself I do ask more
I ask you to have the hardest
conversations the ones that require you
to listen patiently to another person
and see if you can build a bridge to
understanding instead of just being
right there is this vision of the US as
a country where different ideas and
different kinds of people all mix and
everybody has the same power to choose
their path in life I don&#39;t feel like
we&#39;re getting closer to it it feels it
feels drifting to me but I love this
country
I&#39;m an American and I&#39;m worried about my
country and I think that part of the
solution is to improve the way that we
talk about the most important subjects
and a lot of it has to do with
understanding that righteousness has a
place and it&#39;s important but what I
would like you all to do is aspire to be
persuasive thank you
