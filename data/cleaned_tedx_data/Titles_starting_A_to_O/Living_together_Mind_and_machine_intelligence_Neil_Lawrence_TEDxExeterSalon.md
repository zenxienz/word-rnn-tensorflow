the diving bell and the butterfly is the
autobiography of Jean Dominique Bobby in
1995 Jean Dominique was the
editor-in-chief of the French fashion
magazine Elle he suffered a stroke that
destroyed his brain stem he lost almost
all his physical capability but remained
mentally active he had acquired what we
know of as locked-in syndrome incredibly
Bobby wrote his book after he had become
locked in the only muscle he could move
was his left eye so he wrote the entire
book by winking the way they did it is
they set up the letters of the French
alphabet in frequency order pointed to
each one and when they came across the
letter that he wanted he would wink it
took ten months four hours a day to
complete the book each word took two
minutes to write that is the nature of
being locked in your intelligence my
intelligence is also locked in Claude
Shannon is the father of information
theory he defined the fundamental unit
of information as to be the amount of
information that transfers between us if
I were to toss a coin look at the result
and say heads that&#39;s one bit of
information he suggested that
information should be additive so if I
toss the coin twice heads and in the
second time tails you get two bits of
information he was also interested in
the amount of information in the English
language and he determined on average
each word in the English language has 12
bits of information equivalent
well of coin tosses now if we think
about Bobby he was communicating at a
rate of one word every two minutes now
if we assume the amount of information
in the French language is the same as
the English which it certainly isn&#39;t to
me but to a French speaker it would be
then we can see that he was
communicating at a rate of twelve bits
every two minutes so six bits per minute
that&#39;s his communication rate so how
does that compare to us well the average
TEDx speaker talks at about 160 words
per minute 320 times faster than Bobi so
that&#39;s about 2,000 bits per minute 2000
coin tosses that&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t think I
could say that just straight out like
that so there&#39;s a lot of information my
words we&#39;re doing quite well but imagine
how much more thought that Bobby was
putting in to each of his words that&#39;s
what it means to be locked in now we
have other intelligences around us it&#39;s
not just us there are computers and
those computers also communicate with
one another now when a computer is
communicating with another computer it
does so at the rate of billions of bits
per minute orders of magnitude faster
than us it&#39;s in a totally different
regime now communication isn&#39;t the only
aspect of being locked in you have to
have a number of thoughts so it&#39;s not
just how fast you&#39;re communicating it&#39;s
how fast you can think so Bobby and I we
can assume we probably roughly think at
the same rate but where our computers on
that scale well you might be surprised
to know that actually computers think
slower than Mouse what am I saying that
doesn&#39;t seem to make sense because we
know that a computer can calculate
faster than us and ensure it can if
we&#39;re calculating consciously but
underlying our thoughts
there&#39;s millions hundreds billions of
calculations going on in our neurons
which generate our higher thoughts how
many we don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t know
the mapping of those calculations to our
thoughts but what we can estimate is how
large
machine it would require for us to
emulate a human mind the machine we
would need is actually here in Exeter
it&#39;s the fastest computer in the UK it&#39;s
the eleventh fastest in the world we
just missed the top ten it computes that
16 billion billion calculations per
second and it&#39;s used to simulate the
weather across the world every day so in
order to compute as as fast as a human
being we need that 11th fastest computer
but in contrast our ability to
communicate is slower this is what leads
to our locked-in intelligence the ratio
our ability to communicate versus our
ability to compute I call this the
embodiment factor and one way of
thinking about it is to think of how
long it would take to tell you what is
in one second of computation so if we
were to take a computer and take what it
does in one second of computation and
allow it to try and communicate all that
information it turns out it would take
for a typical computer not the Met
Office wanna sort of slow one that we
might own around 20 minutes so a little
bit longer than a TEDTalk should be
however if I were to stop and think for
a second and if I now was capable of
accessing all my neurons and all the
calculations they were doing and capable
of starting to speak and tell you those
it would take us 15 billion years to get
through them that&#39;s longer than the age
of the universe I think most of you
would have left
Bobi on the other hand is five trillion
years longer sure 320 times longer but
when you compare the computer with its
twenty minutes and asked with our 15
billion years we&#39;re right there with
Bobby we&#39;re in the same place that&#39;s
what I mean when I say that you&#39;re
locked in one analogy I use to think
about this is is cars I was a mechanical
engineer as an undergraduate I love cars
so I like to think of Formula one engine
is very powerful engines that&#39;s our
intellect that&#39;s the quality of what&#39;s
going on in our head that&#39;s the power
that we have but unfortunately when we
try and drive those cars think not of
the regular Formula One car think of a
car with that engine but when you look
at the wheels in your mind think of
bicycle wheels
that&#39;s your ability to deploy that
intellectual power onto the track in
contrast our computers are less well
powered they have less power in their
engines but they have well matched tires
they&#39;re more like a go-cart they can use
all their power to deploy so they&#39;re
more efficient than us but they&#39;re
somehow less beautiful less
extraordinary who wouldn&#39;t want to watch
people driving those extraordinary
vehicles or attempting to so where do we
use that excess power if we can&#39;t deploy
it on the track well I&#39;m trying to
communicate with you now whether I&#39;m
doing so well or not is dependent on my
choice of what words I use the analogies
I choose the things I say to try and
understand my audience and say if I say
this thing it will move their mind
towards where my mind is I can
communicate state in that way if I have
a conversation with an individual when
I&#39;m speaking to that individual I have a
mental model in my mind of what that
individual thinks and I choose my words
that I send to that individual in order
to try and take my thoughts and put it
in their minds they of course have the
same image in their heads of who I am
and what I think about them so they then
make a choice of what to say back
because they don&#39;t understand or they
look quizzically at me they make some
kind of response
when it works this this dance is
beautiful our ability to communicate
ideas but if we misdirect our words or
we don&#39;t understand each other what we
get is a horrible crash an argument
follows computers are very different
their intelligence is based on large
amounts of data they are not using all
that compute to model us they use more
data than we can possibly imagine and
that&#39;s not a problem
that&#39;s fine because that&#39;s complementary
to what we do we can&#39;t deal with the
large data but we work well with other
humans they deal with large data but
don&#39;t work so well with other humans
however when you interact with the
computer it&#39;s important to bear this in
mind it&#39;s important to remember that you
are not interacting with another human
our tendency to model what we
communicate means that we tend to
anthropomorphize everything embodiment
in fact is explain why at one level we
are capable of simulating our weather
across the planet but not capable of
designing things that understand our
moods as humans we empathize a cat&#39;s
dogs a cars we give them all human
characteristics in an effort to
communicate with them our computers are
very different their computation is
being based on very large amounts of
data the challenge is that our fears
around AI are based on this
anthropomorphize ation we fear we are
creating a better version of us
something with the same motivations as
ourselves but more powerful because it
has these additional abilities we are
not the real danger is a very different
one the real danger is that those
computers do not anthropomorphize us
they work below our cognitive radar they
make decisions about us without
understanding the human condition that
is the challenge
some researchers advocate transhumanism
who wouldn&#39;t want the ability to
assimilate this communication power of
the computer that multi-billionaire
power that is within the machine what if
it is our limitations that define us
what if the thing that we value the most
our consciousness is a side effect of
our need to understand and be understood
artificial intelligence is not the same
as humans the a in AI does not stand for
anthropomorphic it stands for artificial
artificial in the way that a plastic
plant is artificial there are real
dangers with AI as there are with any
new technology but if we are to face
those dangers head-on as a society we
need to understand what we are dealing
with we are defined by a need to
communicate our lives are defined by the
things we create whether it&#39;s music
dance art literature poetry even sport
the computer has no need of these your
cat understands you better than your
computer understands you your cat
understands me better than your computer
understands me and it hasn&#39;t even met me
when you think of AI think of the
plastic plant a plastic plant does some
of the things a real plant does it&#39;s
also very convenient it doesn&#39;t need
watering it doesn&#39;t need light it won&#39;t
outgrow the place you put it it fulfills
some of the characteristics of a real
plant but it is not a real plant our
fears around AI are based around a
conflation of who we are
and what we create we are defined by our
limitations just as Bobby was defined by
his or maybe limitations is the wrong
word because as Bobby says we can always
escape within ourselves and these are
his words my cocoon becomes less
oppressive and my mind takes flight like
a butterfly
there is so much to do you can wander
off in space or in time set out for
Tierra del Fuego or for King Midas&#39;s
Court you can visit the woman you love
slide down beside her and Stroke her
still sleeping face you can build
castles in Spain steal the Golden Fleece
discover Atlantis realize your childhood
dreams and adult ambitions enough
rambling my main task now is to compose
the first of these bedridden travel
notes so that I shall be ready when my
publisher is a missionary emissary Rhys
arrives to take my dictation letter by
letter in my head I turn over every
sentence 10 times delete a word add an
adjective and learn my text by heart
paragraph by paragraph this book this
fight can never bud from an artificial
plant
