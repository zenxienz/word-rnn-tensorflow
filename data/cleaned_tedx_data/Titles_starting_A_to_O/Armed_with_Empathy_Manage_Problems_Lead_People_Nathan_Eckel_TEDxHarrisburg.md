so I brought along two friends Fred and
George would you like to meet them
Fred Flintstone and George Jetson one
represented the world of the past the
other the world of the future but today
both are completely irrelevant because
in today&#39;s world problems can be managed
but people must be led we&#39;ve evolved and
we can no longer manage people by policy
instead we have to lead with empathy now
you remember the time when they dragged
this guy off the plane with a bloody
nose shrieking screaming and clawing and
we found out later he was a doctor or
maybe when the restaurant fired hashtag
Brad&#39;s wife after 12 years of faithful
service with no explanation at all on
Brad&#39;s birthday or maybe it&#39;s the latest
incident that has people scratching
their heads wherever you live work
worship or play
how can we fly and land dozens hundreds
thousands of aircraft safely every
single day for weeks months and years
yet we cannot manage to peacefully
remove one person from a plane problems
can be managed people must be led and we
can no longer manage people by policy
instead we have the opportunity to
practice new skills that will allow us
to lead with empathy and here&#39;s my
question
in a world that is fearful divided and
seems to be coming apart at the seams on
the one hand but on the other hand is
capable of unity empowerment and justice
for everyone which side do we want to be
on if you want to be the change that you
wish to see in the world as I also do
then here are three simple skills that
we can choose to practice to arm
ourselves with empathy want to hear him
right but first a story the other day I
was outside first thing in the morning
walking my down down by the river and
the words of my neighbor bill began to
haunt my mind everyone wants the
neighbor like bill personable but not
nosy and for me bill is a treasure trove
of do-it-yourself information that I
really appreciate because I&#39;m a
first-time homebuyer so when bill speaks
I listen and I do what he says so when I
was approaching the house
I remember the dill said the other day
some guys were looking for you Nathan
they said they need to work on your yard
now I know it&#39;s a privilege to have a
nice yard or in my case to have once had
a nice yard but I wasn&#39;t counting my
blessings in this moment instead I was
trying to remember the three skills that
I needed to know right then to arm
myself with empathy and I have a promise
for you here&#39;s what the promise isn&#39;t
arming ourselves with empathy is not a
magic wand it&#39;s not going to fix a
deeply divided world overnight but I
will guarantee you this when we arm our
self with empathy we&#39;re going to get to
things better results more of the time
than if we hadn&#39;t armed ourself at all
better results more of the time fair
enough the first way we can arm
ourselves with empathy is to assume
noble intent when we assume noble intent
we make possible a positive chain
reaction that can influence the
situation through good will because
these sticky situations in life that we
all seem to see online as well as get
into occasionally ourselves can go
either way
and sometimes it&#39;s a negative
self-fulfilling prophecy
why not reverse it right off the bat by
putting positive chain reaction into
motion by assuming noble intent what did
this look like for me well I had to say
to myself as I quickly as I was walking
up to these gentlemen and remind myself
why they were there these people do not
make a living destroying things
instead
they repair things so I said Nathan
they&#39;re not here to wreck your yard
they&#39;re here to fix the power for the
entire neighborhood they&#39;re not here
direct things they&#39;re here to fix things
assume noble intent the second thing we
can do to arm ourselves with empathy
starts with the letter R and that is to
reach common ground as soon as possible
when we reach common ground as soon as
we possibly can
we&#39;re able to build off of the
foundation of goodwill and we introduce
a couple of things we introduce the
opportunity to build trust quickly and
we also introduce the ability to
positively influence that other person
in a critical time sensitive situation
so what did this look like for me we got
to reach common ground here I&#39;m walking
up to them I say to myself not only are
they here to for noble purposes for good
purposes but you know what I want my
power back on and I also want it to stay
on and they want my power to go back on
and stay on see what I&#39;m getting at here
simple change in the way that we think
in a critical time so I want the power
back on they want the power back on we
reached common ground the third thing
that we can do to arm ourselves with
empathy it starts with the letter M and
that is to model the desired behavior
because when we did model the desired
behavior that we want to see then we&#39;re
able to build off of the goodwill the
trust in the influence of the previous
steps and we are then able to make
possible the opportunity to have
cooperation from the other person now in
this scenario who needed to cooperate me
so this is where it got a little bit of
a twist I did everything I could to
model the desired behavior from these
gentlemen I started breathing very
deeply
I started just kind of trying to relax I
put on the most contrived smile that
I&#39;ve ever had on this face even more
than this one in my entire life and then
I decided to keep the interaction as
light as I possibly could and then this
is where these gentlemen found that and
showed me and demonstrated their true
professionalism because they do these
kinds of interactions every day don&#39;t
they so they took my feeble attempt at
levity and they raised it so many
notches you would have thought we were
in a comedy club so I say hey guys
however what&#39;s you up to here on my lawn
and they said sir we are here to rip up
your yard and after a very nervous
shuffle the ice was broken and they
modeled the desired behaviors they
wanted from me basically scope the
project out let me know what I was in
for and then most important for what I
wanted in the situation is they did give
me assurance --is that someday someone
would be dispatched to repair my yard
imagine what could have happened even
what would have happened if I had
remained disarmed in this situation
here&#39;s what I know
my vital moment is still just around the
corner and so is yours and when we arm
ourselves we become our best self to
lead with empathy thank you very much
you
