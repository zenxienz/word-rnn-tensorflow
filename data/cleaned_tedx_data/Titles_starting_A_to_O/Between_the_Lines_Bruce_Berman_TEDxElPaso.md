I talked to you today about walking
between the lines and the nature of
documentary photography and I think
they&#39;re parallel ideas and I&#39;ve been
walking between those lines for a long
time and I&#39;d like to talk to you about
myself a little bit how I got started in
photography and wandered into
documentary photography somehow I this
first slide here which is already up
here is where I started documentary
photography but two months before that I
was at the University of Oklahoma and I
didn&#39;t go there to be a photographer I
went there to be a journalist and I was
taking creative writing classes and I
couldn&#39;t believe that was really
compelling to me and I started writing
query letters which was part of the
class requirement and I wrote all the
major magazines and I was getting very
nice rejections it was awesome but they
were nice and I went to my professor I
was totally encouraged like they didn&#39;t
just say no and my professor I asked
message
professor Swain you know looks like I&#39;m
happening so what should I do next
and he said looked me right in the eye
and he said I think you should quit the
university I think you should quit the
university and go somewhere that
something can happen and maybe start
living a life that you might have
something to write about
and find your mission in life oh wow
and I actually you always listen to your
professor right I did it I quit college
I wandered back to Chicago and you know
a funny thing is I I had a kind of job I
got down to my last pennies right
post-graduation
and you know pretty soon I found myself
you know I&#39;m you know I&#39;m not writing I
don&#39;t have a life yet in two months how
could that have happened so I found
myself though accidentally living in a
neighborhood where that last great
migration wave of Blues players were
ending up in Chicago that came up the
Mississippi River the Mississippi Delta
players Howlin wolf Little Walter Muddy
Waters the great ones I really wish I
could show you those pictures but I was
such a bad new photographer I don&#39;t have
those pictures they weren&#39;t that good I

was shooting in the bars till 4:00 in
the morning
but this is what I would do after the
bars on my way home by the way the bars

in Chicago closed at 4:00 and my job

started at 8:00 so these were kind of
tight sleeping years but okay so what I
did have because there was more light
out on the streets was the photographs
of all the Blues guys hanging out after
the bars and that wasn&#39;t quite you know
a voice yet but it was I did learn the
first principle a turning point so to
speak photograph was close to you and
what&#39;s your most passionate about and I
started hanging with these guys so much
I started thinking like I&#39;m part of the
blues movement in Chicago right now I&#39;m
not I&#39;m just a kid with a camera but I
think that&#39;s really important because
right off the bat eventually you&#39;ve shot
what you&#39;ve shot and you&#39;re not part of
the community you&#39;re photographing in
your walking between the lines of that
community and who you want to
communicate you so I&#39;m beginning to be a
photographer untrained as I am and I&#39;m
starting an idea it&#39;s a it&#39;s about the
people in front of the camera not really
about me I don&#39;t know how to do this
exactly but I buy the way I&#39;m not
writing anymore because I still don&#39;t
have a life after four months I&#39;m just a
beginning guy so I did start to think I
was maybe I didn&#39;t go to journalism
school maybe I should start to do
something with the news and those were
the years of heavy protests this was at
the end of the Martin Luther King the
spring before Martin Luther King had
been murdered in Memphis he was living
in Chicago and his organization went on
and all of a sudden there&#39;s all this
turmoil and police riots and stuff going
on it so I wandered round from protest
to protest I still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m
doing by the way those times sound
familiar all of a sudden right and I I
knew this man his name is Marvin he was
a pivot Pima Indian from Arizona and he
gave me a call and he said we&#39;re gonna
take over the Bureau of Indian Affairs
office downtown this also sounds
familiar a little bit and we would you
come down and I said well you know okay
so I get on the train and I go down and
it&#39;s eight o&#39;clock in the morning and
I&#39;m looking there&#39;s police with big
clubs and guns and you know big lines in
front of the building and I went out
I went across that line it&#39;s kind of
hesitating and Marvin came up to me and
he said another turning point said we
really need you to come with us because
if you don&#39;t come in with us this never
happened and I went wow there is kind of
a definition of what documentary
photography is it does things don&#39;t
exist unless a community can have a
voice and I started to find myself his
last thing you said to me was the key it
was the hook and we need your help you
know wow I can do something when
photography to help people this was
really compelling to me so we went up
there was a very dirty three days I have
to tell you there was one washroom in
that entire office and I took it over
for three days and you know there we
were but I was off and running I began
to understand that photography could be
a bridge between audiences between you
and him to get their voice out I also
found that to have an effective voice
you couldn&#39;t bear a proselytizer you
just have to show what&#39;s there and
that&#39;s what separates documentary
photography from journalism journalism
is about what&#39;s happening these days
it&#39;s kind of opinion and what&#39;s
happening but good documentary
photography is just what&#39;s there done
well it&#39;s not so much about the
photographer but about who&#39;s on the
other side
last slide from the Chicago era so these
were times of turmoil and disruption
Martin Luther King&#39;s organization was
still in Chicago Jesse Jackson beat the
Reverend took over that organization
after King&#39;s demise and I found myself
working with him and this man named
Chuck Geary who was a Appalachian person
were more Appalachian people in Chicago
in that era era than there were there
were anywhere else it was like up the
Mississippi River so I found myself
working with him I was sent there on my
big first job I worked for the learner
home newspapers in Chicago five bucks a
photo Wow I knew I started my career so
I working with Chuck and they were doing
things like feeding the community
educating the community all that
community organizers stuff we just had
one for president and bottom line I&#39;m
liking it but you know Chuck comes up to
me one day says look your
here all the time why don&#39;t you just
move in with us so I moved in with Chuck
URIs family and that was another turning
point because I realized to do good
documentary photography you can&#39;t come
and go you can be an insider but for a
while but you can&#39;t come and go because
you&#39;re you don&#39;t have credibility and
those communities are very closed and
they&#39;re very wary and they&#39;re very
helpless and if you&#39;re going to offer
your help and you&#39;re being asked to help
you need to move in so I moved in with
this family a week turned into a year
and a half and as all stories and I tell
my students a few of who are here today
there&#39;s a documentary clock you&#39;ve got
to start somewhere it&#39;s 12 o&#39;clock and
then you&#39;re working for 10-15 minutes on
the clock and all of a sudden I got it&#39;s
forget him he&#39;s just a fly on the wall
you know he&#39;s not important and that&#39;s
when you can work and you start working
and it&#39;s 10 after and 15 after and you
know you&#39;re heading toward you know the
end of the story but eventually all
stories in do you you&#39;ve said what you
had to say you&#39;ve learned what you&#39;ve
had to lay learn it&#39;s the second thing I
want to say that I say to my students
which is I&#39;d like you to use photography
as an instrument of Education not
self-expression
so maybe you can matter and they look at
me like oh it&#39;s too heavy and I go and
it&#39;s the way it is I had learned enough
about this community it was time to move
on so it was time to move west digging
out things for this talk I came across
this little document that was written in
November 1970 another turning point and
the primary thing here is Chuck let me
into his life and into his family&#39;s life
and I had the position of a privileged I
whoa that blew me away
because finally I&#39;m having these steps
photograph what&#39;s familiar photograph
which are compassionate about if you can
help help and then what a privilege it
is to be allowed into communities to do
that helping that set me that set me up
for El Paso so next next step we&#39;re in
El Paso I come down here from the dark
men living in the riots I&#39;m in Chicago
where&#39;s the trouble on the border and I
find that what trouble on the Borg Wow
and all of a sudden I&#39;ve been a
black-and-white photographer from the
beginning developing my little film and
everything and there was no way to be a
black-and-white photographer in Chicago
in my mind this place blew me away
instantly I had a job at UTEP is how I
got here
with three weeks they said you want to
come down to Utah can you be here in
three weeks I was there that&#39;s not how
they hire everybody don&#39;t worry but I
found myself here and you&#39;ve run into
the color and the animation of this
border and yes there&#39;s troubles on the
border and there&#39;s also great beauty and
great aspiration on this border so I was
on that this is a 1980 slide of the
corner of Mesa and father Rahm which was
5th Avenue here and the color and the
beauty and all of this was coming to me
like the documentary could be more than
heavy stuff it can be what it is by
definition the documentation of a place
and a people and what I&#39;ve learned from
this place is you know it&#39;s my riches
it&#39;s my adulthood which is family and
loyalty and that energy between two
distant and disparate things can be very
in enriching and empowering so I started
to realize I don&#39;t have to tell heavy
stories here I can just tell stories
this is Fred tourist Fred tourist lives
where I&#39;ve lived for 37 years on Alameda
Street three blocks from the bridge and
Fred saw me photographing out in the
street he says you want to come into my
house I&#39;m gonna oh it&#39;s one of these
places you might not come out him and
let me tell you Fred&#39;s story very
briefly fred is playing the yueqin 76
years old in this photograph this
photograph was made in 1987 in this
photograph he&#39;s playing the ukulele that
his high school sweetheart gave him
singing the song she most loved in the
room he was born in I&#39;m going this place
El Paso is so rich in stories so rich in
culture so rich in family so I decided
that&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna do I don&#39;t really
have a thing to do here I&#39;m just gonna
shoot who I meet and just tell their
stories and that became the
or project and I&#39;ve showed the border
project a few times in El Paso and
elsewhere and you may I hope some of you
have seen the work there was a new
definition of documentary photography
theory yes you walk between the lines I
walk between Fred and I walk between you
but I&#39;m more and more aware now it&#39;s the
walk between not trying to become part
of Fred&#39;s life not trying to become part
of Chuck&#39;s life dad trying to be a Pima
Indian from Arizona but walking in
between two communication channels at
one channel the people who live this who
are the other side of my camera and the
people like you who might have an
interest in a Fred tourists and the
richness of El Paso and how far back he
goes into our history yes I&#39;ve touched
on the issues here I worked for the New
York Times for about 26 years on the
border I was a contract photographer
until I took my recent job at NMSU and
yes the the border has these issues
immigration is one we&#39;re all involved in
that every day we turn on the TV or look
at a newspaper we are all involved in
that issue and I have a book I&#39;m not
gonna heart what do you call it wonder
they call it Hawk a book but my book is
called walking between walking wadis as
my talk is called walking between the
lines I&#39;ve walked the border a lot
you can&#39;t avoid certain issues we can&#39;t
avoid certain issues but I think the
issues are for you to decide not the
photographer and I kind of like to make
that point because I do teach journalism
and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re on trouble time in
journalism because we we to survive as
business entities there&#39;s more opinion
being offered than where it was offered
because they don&#39;t exist unless their
base keeps buying the paper so bottom
line I try to walk between that line
it&#39;s why I veered off into documentary
photography solely because I really
think it&#39;s the without the audience
being respected for their opinion about
these things you can&#39;t convince people
of anything you can only do what I the
second big thing I learned was I don&#39;t
somebody stole my Thunder here before
because I said save the world the
architect I used to think you could save
that
with photography I don&#39;t think that
anymore I think the only use it really
can have is to remind people who want to
be reminded of things of what they want
to be reminded of that&#39;s where I come in
I&#39;m the guy walking between the line
gathering the information Thursday this
is an immigration this is a levy I used
to hang there I was soaked so crazy for
doing this I actually left UTEP and just
decided to be the photographer and the
border and became the border guy you
know this is last one of this color
series there&#39;s much more work I have to
tell you by the way I showed this all to
my students last Thursday just to sort
of run him past it and they devastated
me they stayed after class they cut my
talk in half and they took out what 3/4
of my slides it was too long I hope I&#39;m
doing better with you but anyway this is
a classic border thing there&#39;s the
border fence but there&#39;s two two sisters
from both sides of that border there
there doesn&#39;t need to be a fence there
it really doesn&#39;t this is one people
however the cartel work came and I
couldn&#39;t ignore it because I was the
border photographer so I said to myself
if you&#39;re the border photographer you&#39;ve
got to do this and I didn&#39;t like it
it&#39;s saddest time we&#39;ve had it&#39;s a sad
time most a time I&#39;ve ever had here is
friends in trouble The Laugh was gone
from wadis but I had to do it so I went
over you won&#39;t be seeing anything bad
here what I have lots of it but what I
wanted to tell you was the grief is what
really impressed me the grief of that
war I don&#39;t know if that war is over or
it&#39;s back between the curtains but the
bottom line is it&#39;s a better time here
this is the time to be happier and if
you go to what is now you&#39;ll see the joy
and the animation and the it&#39;s wadis
again and it&#39;s a new widest so it&#39;s
incredible for our city I got to wrap
this up pretty quick gathering people&#39;s
stories this woman abandoned in the
Lower Valley here they came with her
husband here he didn&#39;t come back
these are little stories these are sad
stories and they they fold into that
this is Latin second-to-last photo and
in the series this is a wedding on the
bridge I find that real happy it&#39;s a
total illustration of our problem here
though he is from what is and he can&#39;t
get paper
to come over as she is from El Paso as
she can&#39;t get papers to come over but
they love each other so what do you do
you get married on the top of the bridge
then unfortunately you had to go back to
your respective homes this is an
illustration of immigration gone amuck
this is an helicam praying in front of
cross in front of Sagrado Corazon I
asked her why crowded Corazon and not
your church and Juana&#39;s and she said and
this is during the cartel war God has
left what as I hope you&#39;ll listen to me
here I want to conclude this just by
saying what I&#39;ve learned about
photography is there&#39;s nothing without
you there&#39;s them and you and I&#39;m just
the person walking in between those
lines I hope you got something from this
[Applause]
