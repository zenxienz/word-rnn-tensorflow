all right thanks so much and I hope that
grabbed your attention because it&#39;s it&#39;s
always a bit unkind to the speaker who
the last speaker of the evening and to
make matters worse I speak after one
tennis great and one all-around great
javed akhtar saab so i&#39;m both
disappointed that that i have to you
know try and do a finish up act after
him
and also excited to speak to you about
issues that really are close to my heart
you know people want journalists to
speak about journalism to speak about
the interviews they did and the stories
they did instead i want to talk about
the passion that makes most journalists
tick
the truth is that today it&#39;s not the
same as it was let&#39;s be honest ten years
ago ten years ago i used to go around
and give lectures about being a
journalist and i&#39;d get you know people
asking me to for autographs and you know
and people asking me how can i send my
kid to journalism school how do they get
into a television channel and everyone
had stars in their eyes today there are
no stars in everyone&#39;s eyes
words like a prostitute are used words
that that showed that the media is no
longer at a high pedestal at once were i
use and i just want to give you in these
next few minutes a sense of the kind of
passion that drives us I&#39;ll tell you why
I showed you that bomb blast in a second
it&#39;s of course it&#39;s it&#39;s not a real
video it&#39;s from the heart Locker as many
of you might know did you know for
example that the average bomb and the
average bombs just about this big right
you either strap it on like a suicide
bomber or you put it place it under
somebody&#39;s chair everybody&#39;s suddenly
looking to see if they&#39;ve got any there
it&#39;s about this big when it detonates it
detonates at the speed of eight and a
half kilometers per second to put that
in perspective that&#39;s 22 times faster
than a 9mm bullet coming out of an
automatic handgun right if you talk
about the air pressure around and you
can see some of that around a bomb that
goes off it&#39;s about a
in 50 times what your normal air
pressure of about I think 15 pounds per
second is if you look at the heat it
goes way over boiling point it goes way
over the hundreds even sometimes it goes
way over a thousand degrees as well
nuclear bomb of course is much more than
that
so we&#39;re talking about a very very high
intensity and that&#39;s when the bomb
detonates even so scientists will tell
you that there is one milli second one
little mili second in which the the bomb
detonates but all the oxygen in the air
is sucked down that&#39;s the kind of
silence you have in that one milli
second before the bomb detonates and
then every part of the bomb whatever you
packed inside the bomb sometimes it&#39;s
nails sometimes it&#39;s ball bearings they
go out like a projectile now think about
everything I have just told you for an
average bomb a small bomb and
extrapolate that to a car bomb a car
bomb packed with a gas cylinder which is
packed with explosives and there are
explosives under all the seats that
ladies and gentlemen was really my
moment of truth and that&#39;s what I want
to speak about this afternoon the fact
is we all go through life with many
experiences but there are a few moments
in each of our lives that are crystal
clear it was August 10th 2000 17 years
ago when I was a reporter in Kashmir and
as reporters do we tend to be in places
when there is a bad situation going on
there&#39;s a conflict in the area and we
happen to be in a certain area actually
I was shopping that morning because I
was headed home after that when we heard
something go off now the average
reaction of most people if I was to you
know set something off in the middle of
this theater is to run the average react
off the average journalist and certainly
every journalist I know is to run in the
opposite direction as in towards the
sound when we got there we realized
there was a little grenade and we sort
of took it easy not realizing that that
grenade was a ruse the idea off that
grenade was to bring in as many security
forces bomb disposal squad and policemen
into that area before detonating the car
bomb the car bomb exploded it exploded
right in front of us as I look around
and maybe now I&#39;m talking in nanoseconds
and no longer speaking in the average
second that human beings think of in
these things then and that&#39;s one of the
reasons why that bomb blast goes out in
slow motion because that&#39;s how you feel
when you&#39;re inside it when you&#39;re
feeling the heat or taking the pressure
or being hit by a projectile as the
photographer next to me was he died more
than a dozen other people died over
there but the truth was that for that
one millisecond before everything
happened I had a moment of clarity I
can&#39;t explain it it was just there it
was this moment of clarity which is why
yours later you know now when I hear
people say my entire life flashed before
my eyes I don&#39;t laugh about it it&#39;s not
a cliche it is the truth because it
isn&#39;t that one moment of clarity that
you realize what it is you care about
what matters to you or who matters to
you is it your parents
is it a husband or wife or girlfriend
the boyfriend is it your children is it
a home in the hills that you&#39;ve always
loved is it an idea is it an infant
unfinished work something you&#39;ve written
which you&#39;ve only half written what is
important to you and that&#39;s that moment
that you have to try and use so we all
have these moments you look in history
there are lots of these moments I&#39;ll
take all the most famous ones of course
Mahatma Gandhi his moment was probably
not
to do with the with with the Indian
freedom struggle it had to do with being
thrown off a train because he was
travelling by in a first-class
compartment as he sat on that platform
he tried to explain that he had a ticket
for the first class but the reason he
was thrown off was because of the color
of his skin or in the u.s. Martin Luther
King in 1956 he was already a civil
rights activist but there are lots of
civil rights activists I mean there were
lots even at that time what was his
moment of truth was being pulled over
not for protesting not for burning a
flag or burning his registration card
but for over speeding he was pulled over
because he was 5 kilometers over the
speed limit but the way that he was
treated once again because of the color
of his skin is what made Martin Luther
King jr. the man that we saw the man
that we don&#39;t even realize today was
less than 40 years old when he was
killed so there are all these stories
from before Malala yousufzai for example
we all know what her moment of truth was
right that moment of clarity should have
been when she was shot by a Taliban
gunman for attempting to go to school
and give her exams but that&#39;s not the
most important thing she&#39;s done so it&#39;s
not just important what your moment of
truth is because each of us will have a
moment of truth when we know what what
matters to us it is what you do with
that moment of truth that really counts
so Malala yousufzai will now be
remembered I don&#39;t know how many of you
saw that she is now five years later
entered Oxford and is known for her one
book one pen one teacher one child
campaign I had in my life to such
journalists who sort of told me it&#39;s not
important what you do it&#39;s not important
what your moment of truth is it&#39;s what
you do with that moment of truth that
counts
the first was a camera woman who by
coincidence I had traveled to Kashmir
with who said to me what are you scared
of in those days I was
you know Java top can just get an honor
stage and speak I just did not have the
courage to even get in front of a camera
I do 30 takes 35 takes and I&#39;d still not
be able to say my own name you know in
one go and she said to me what are you
afraid of now it&#39;s very intimidating
when somebody like her was saying it to
me because about 10 years before she had
come with me to Kashmir to do some very
grueling camera work
Margaret Motte was in Sarajevo and she
just had you know beat around the corner
and she was filming something when a
mortar shell hit her from here it took
her entire jaw off Margaret had to go
through all kinds of you know
restructuring of her jaw and she was
finally able to come back and and and
and work as a camera person and she said
to me if I can come back you can do
anything you want to do basically but
you have to find that moment of truth
the fact is that all of us you know we
we seem to think that motivation is
going to come from something that is
external but the truth is that
motivation ends up being something that
has happened to you there&#39;s no other way
around it for some people it&#39;s an
accident for some people it&#39;s something
terrible like this for some it&#39;s a
really great occasion you get married to
someone you love you you you have a
child there are others who have been
just motivated by you know a pet or
motivated by a desire to go into the
mountains there was one of my friends
who in fact address a TED talk just last
year who was motivated by a book he read
at the end of the evening this was a
techie MBA traveling around the world
living in the best of style who finished
a book one evening and said I want to be
a writer who can evoke these kind of
images and overnight he turned from this
techie MBA into into an author and he&#39;s
already
three books in so that became his his
moment of truth and each of us has to
find it and find what it is that we want
to do with that moment to be honest I
wasn&#39;t very good about my moment of
truth at least not immediately when I
got over my injuries and I had to have
surgery I felt that this was a sign that
I should basically take it easy then
somehow if there was a moment of clarity
in my mind that clarity actually meant
that I needed to take a back seat in
what I was doing I had two young girls
less than three years old at the time
and a husband and while he never said
anything I&#39;m sure nobody wants to be at
the opposite end of a phone being told
your wife is injured she&#39;s in hospital
and I felt that this was then my sign
just take a little bit of a backseat I
you know don&#39;t put your hand up for
every assignment when you do go on
assignment look over your shoulder be a
little more careful you know I even
could change jobs in the mean in the
meanwhile in all of this but if you were
lucky as I was that moment of truth is
going to follow you and I found that
even while I was taking my backseat I
was being pushed into areas as a
journalist where I just I didn&#39;t have a
chance for my fears so I was sitting in
in in an office minding the office wild
vacations were on when the phone call
came to say there&#39;s a military plane
going into tsunami hit areas do you want
to go and I looked around and literally
there wasn&#39;t even a mouse in that office
on Christmas Day and I said well I guess
there&#39;s nobody else to go so I will
there was another time when I was
sitting very safely inside a studio and
reading the news when a call came to say
they&#39;re asking if you can go to Lebanon
because Indians are being evacuated from
the war over there can you go cover it
and again you know I got pushed into
into going back and trying to find what
it is I love to do another was follow
there was Syria there was Libya there
was in my own region I I have a passion
for South Asia an identity I believe is
very very very important to all Indians
and I feel sorry that the next
generation hasn&#39;t yet come to terms with
the South Asia we once grew up believing
would be there and I got to travel to
Pakistan I traveled to Bangladesh to Sri
Lanka to Nepal and slowly I realized
that that moment of truth was coming
back as a result I have to say I&#39;m very
lucky to have been recognized and you
know TED talk is one of them I often get
to speak at convocations for journalism
students and there was this convocation
speech I gave that some of you may have
somewhere heard about it was entitled I
hope you have many job rejections and
when I gave the speech I remember the
students had a kind of nervous laugh
when I said I really hope you get a lot
of job rejections and their parents look
like oh my god this woman is absolutely
mad and my god why I was saying this and
then I explained why I was saying it
because in this period that I was just
describing to you in this haze there was
a moment where I went to apply for a job
which I thought would keep me very safe
it was a documentary channel where I
would be able to Commission
documentaries without working very hard
I really needed this job at that time or
so I thought so I made a very strong
pitch for it and when I walked in the
interviewer said sit down and I felt
actually like I done very well on my
interview and the interviewer said you
know you you are very convincing you&#39;re
probably very qualified for this job so
don&#39;t try and tell me you&#39;re qualified
don&#39;t try and tell me you&#39;re a good
talker you can do the marketing because
I can see that already
you&#39;re flexible you might even like to
like your job you might enjoy this job
but you are going to hate me because
your passion is news and I&#39;m going to
take you away from it if I give you this
job so sorry I&#39;m not going to give you
this job and that&#39;s what I meant by
saying I hope each one of you has that
opportunity has the moment of truth
where or somebody nudges you towards it
to understand what it is that you want
to do I&#39;m not going to wish for you I
mean as a journalist you can wish you
know me you have lots of really good
scoops may you have lots of really good
interviews but I as a conflict
journalist I can&#39;t wish for you me you
get into a bomb blast or me you get shot
at and all the rest but I can wish that
there is this this moment of truth so
I&#39;m going to play this video for you
once again and this time I want you to
watch it and close your eyes and have a
sense of what it is that flashes before
your eyes
at that moment can we just play it again
[Music]
Imagineer that person close your eyes
for exactly three seconds let&#39;s hope you
had your moment of truth thanks a lot
lady
[Applause]
