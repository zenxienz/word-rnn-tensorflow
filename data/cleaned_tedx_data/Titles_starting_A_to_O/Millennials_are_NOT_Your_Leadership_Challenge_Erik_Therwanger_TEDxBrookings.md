all right thank you how would it feel to
work in an environment that&#39;s filled
with passion and innovation and
empowerment what would it be like to be
in a culture that&#39;s productive a culture
that&#39;s inspiring and engaging when I ask
most people that question they answer it
with words like it would be great
incredible it would be awesome what
would it be like to show up to work
every day and be around people that
described it as awesome unfortunately
most people don&#39;t describe their work
cultures like that they use words like
it&#39;s frustrating it&#39;s overwhelming it&#39;s
unsupportive they don&#39;t use awesome they
describe their cultures in a way that
makes it feel off balance which is not a
big surprise when you think that Gallup
did a poll that suggests that over 80
percent of people in the workplace are
either not engaged or actively
disengaged leaving only 13% to be
classified as engaged only 13% who make
positive contributions in the workplace
so how is it with such high levels of
disengagement that some people achieve
harmony
some achieve teamwork that some achieve
balance I believe that those leaders
provide more than a place to work they
provide a place to grow now no one
strives for 13-percent engagement but it
happens and when I ask leaders what
their challenges are and what their
frustrations are in their environments
what causes it to feel off balance
they&#39;ll say things like communication is
poor and team morale is low they&#39;ll say
that I can&#39;t delegate things to anybody
and no one takes initiative and then
eventually inevitably one leader will
say the M word Millennials and the other
leaders will not in agreement yes
Millennials are my challenge too I
struggle with Millennials too and the
leadership fingers point the blame to
that generation now the millennial
generation has the birth years ranging
from the early 1980s to the early 2000s
is it possible that that entire
generation is a problem is it possible
that one generation is causing workplace
cultures to feel off balance around the
world many leaders would say yes and
they would refer to that generation is
entitled and lazy and some would call
them job hoppers with no outlook on the
future
Millennials are absolutely not
a problem they are not
Challenge for leaders who are focused on
providing balance in their environments
just as the Chinese philosophy of yin
and yang suggests that opposites are
required for balance
I believe that leaders who achieve the
highest levels of engagement provide
balance in the workplace but
unfortunately most leaders only focus on
training they train their people in the
hopes of having better workers but they
miss the other half they miss the
portion about developing developing them
so they have better people developing
them to perform like leaders if we want
to bring our environments full circle
then we need to provide the engagement
ring we need to make that commitment to
do more than train but the vow to
develop our people and I remember
exactly where I was standing when I
learned the difference between training
and development and it was August 24th
1987 and I stepped on to the yellow
footprints at the recruiting Depot for
the marine corps in San Diego California
that was my first day on the job does
anybody remember their first and their
job in most companies you have an
onboarding program you have a tour and
orientation you get to meet your
co-workers and I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s
probably friendly and nice
maybe welcoming that&#39;s not what happened

here it was 11:30 at night when all of
us showed up and we all stood on the
yellow footprints and we were surrounded
by drill instructors and they were
yelling and they were screaming and it
was chaotic but that was the beginning
of becoming part of something special on
something great that was the first step
for the onboarding program for the
United States Marine Corps also known as
boot camp so let me introduce you to my
on borders
and I want you to get a good look at
that picture because that was the
picture that went home to our moms we
never saw them looking that happy they
were hard on us and bootcamp was tough
we got up at the crack of dawn every
morning and we ran everywhere we went
through the gas chamber together and we
intensely prepared for combat but our
drill instructors did more than just
train us
they developed us as leaders they taught
us leadership traits like justice and
integrity and enthusiasm they taught us
leadership principles like know yourself
and seek self-improvement before I was
issued my weapon before I used my gas
mask and even before I knew what job I
would do I was developed to think like a
leader and act like a leader in every
situation no matter who was following me
in fact I didn&#39;t even know what job I
was gonna do until the very end of boot
camp and the drill instructors went
around and they called off our MOS is
our military occupational specialties
which is just a long way in the military
for saying your job and when they got to
me they called my name
third Wengert everything&#39;s loud in boot
camp so I replied sir here sir and he
said 73 11 they didn&#39;t know what that
job was so I asked my friend Robert
what&#39;s the 73 11 he said I don&#39;t know
man you got to ask him the him he was
talking about was the big guy on the
right sergeant Hughes who two months
earlier choked me out for scratching an
itch on my chest so I said to Robert are
you are you sure you don&#39;t know
and he didn&#39;t know so I had to ask him
permission to talk to him and I said sir
recruit throw anger request permission
to speak to drill instructor sergeant
who&#39;s sir and he said what do you want
dirtbag but he didn&#39;t call me a dirtbag
I&#39;ll let you think about what he might
have called me and I said sir the
recruit does not know what a 70 311 is
sir and he said you&#39;re gonna talk to
airplanes now get out of my face
so I did and I went back over to Robert
and he said hey what are you gonna do
and I said I&#39;m gonna talk to airplanes
and he says well wait a minute what does
that mean and they said I have no clue
but I&#39;m not asking him again on November
13th 1987 I graduated from boot camp and
I remember the words my recruiter said
to me right before I enlisted and he
said Eric becoming a Marine is not about
what you get it&#39;s about who you become
and on that day I became part of
something special and something great on
that day I earned the title of United
States Marine we were trained and we
were developed in an environment that
had balance and after boot camp I was
sent to school they trained me had to be
an air traffic controller and I worked
here in this tower has anyone flown
anywhere recently now how do you feel
knowing 18 year-olds are controlling air
traffic happens every day in the
military that&#39;s Marine Corps Air Station
Yuma Arizona busiest military airport in
the world all branches of service use
our airfield and we also controlled
civilian traffic I was in that tower
because I believed I should be there I
was in that tower not because I was
trained
but because I was developed and my
development caused me to do so much more
with my training I was in that tower not
because I was ordered to be there but
because I was inspired to be there and I
was 18 years old
and air traffic control is a pretty
stressful field but we operated in an
environment of balance of training and
development could you imagine just for a
moment if our entire military operated
with only 13% engagement and their
people and their ranks are filled with
Millennials how are they leading them
how are they achieving the highest
levels of excellence with a generation
that most leaders have given up on
military leaders create the highest
levels of engagement in their people in
Millennials and most business leaders
struggle to even find a shred of buy-in
from that same generation military
leaders create these high levels of
engagement and then I hear business
leaders say things like I can&#39;t find any
good people in this generation and yet
the military has hired trained and
developed 250,000 Millennials since that
generation entered the workforce they
don&#39;t have that problem regardless of
what industry we work in as leaders we
are in the people business and most
businesses miss the people side of their
business we accomplish things through
the efforts of other people including
Millennials and Millennials want the
same things that we do they want to
operate in an environment that&#39;s
balanced they want to be trained and
developed they want to make an impact in
our world they want to make an impact in
their communities and they want to make
an impact in business so don&#39;t just
train them develop them and there&#39;s a
number that we have to be very excited
about that number is 95 95 percent of
people including Millennials want to be
part of something special and something
great and as leaders it&#39;s our job to
plant those seeds in them of development
the leadership seeds that will help them
to develop and help them to grow and we
develop people so that we work with
people who are looking for more than
just income
they want outcome that we&#39;re working
with people who want more than a
position they want purpose we want
people on our teams who want to do more
than just cash a paycheck every two
weeks they want to invest their passion
with us every single day the millennial
generation absolutely does not want to
be your disengaged employees they want
to be your engaged team members and I
think I can speak for them when I say
most of them don&#39;t even like being
called Millennials because people say
the derogatory fashion right now there&#39;s
20 million more members of that
generation and the workforce than baby
boomers and baby boomers are leaving at
a rate of about 10,000 a day so if we
want to have balance in our environments
we have to provide the engagement ring
we got to have balance between training
and development we want to develop
people so they focus on more than just
what they do and how they do it or even
why they do it we develop people so they
focus on who they do it for because
they&#39;re who is infinitely more powerful
than their why at the end of the day
Marines are trained and they&#39;re
developed and they&#39;re developed to focus
on people they focus on their who as a
Murray and I looked out for the marine
to my left and to my right just imagine
for a moment imagine creating a culture
that has balance of training and
development imagine that you can develop
people who focus on their who what would
it be like to walk into work every
single day with people who look out for
the team member to their left and the
team member to their right a bet I bet
it would feel great incredible I bet
some of you would say it would feel
awesome thank you
you
