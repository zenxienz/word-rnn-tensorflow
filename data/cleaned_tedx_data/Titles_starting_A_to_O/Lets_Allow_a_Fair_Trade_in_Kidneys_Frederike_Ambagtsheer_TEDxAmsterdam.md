one step beyond did you know that at
this very moment almost 400,000 people
are waiting for an organ worldwide
400,000 men women and children are
waiting for a heart a liver a kidney or
a lung an even larger number of families
are deeply affected by the illnesses of
their loved ones almost every year more
than 20,000 people die because an organ
could not be found on time to save their
life what if I told you that many of
these deaths are actually preventable
simply by taking one step beyond and
changing our ideas and beliefs about
organ trade of all organs kidneys are
highest in demand and they can be used
from deceased and living donors kidneys
from living donors on average last
almost twice as long as kidneys from
deceased donors amicus live kidney
donation has become a safe procedure
with positive long-term outcomes for
donors in many countries the number of
living kidney donations now exceeds the
number of deceased kidney donations and
because of medical advancements it is
not only possible to use organs from
genetically related donors but also from
unrelated donors such as spouses friends
and neighbors some countries even allow
strangers to donate their kidneys
anonymously to patients on the wait list
yet despite all of the advancements in
transplantation technology and the
efforts of the transplantation community
organ scarcity has not decreased in fact
transplantation has become a victim of
its own success as results improved the
demand for organs increased and organ
supply is unable to keep up
transplant professionals are no longer
talking about an organ scarcity they are
talking about an organ crisis the organ
crisis is not only leading to patients
dying on the wait list or becoming too
sick to be transplanted it has also led
to the development of an illegal organ
market which consists mainly of kidneys
this market coexists with legal donation
policies to fulfill the demand that
legal donation policies fail to fulfill
and patients are now increasingly
turning to this market to buy kidneys it
is an illegal market with great ethical
legal and medical risks most organ trade
research is performed among the poor who
sell their kidneys on the black market
in countries such as India Pakistan
Egypt and the Philippines and their
stories are generally the same they
don&#39;t receive proper information about
your risks of living kidney donations
they don&#39;t get screened they don&#39;t
receive proper medical aftercare they
are cheated and deceived
after receiving much less than the
agreed price or nothing at all and
because they are ashamed and fear being
convicted of having done something
illegal they don&#39;t seek help patients
are victims too they often fly from
abroad to be transplanted in these
countries and return home with grave
medical complications and while donors
receive little to nothing some patients
are known to have paid up to two hundred
thousand euros for a kidney they need it
so badly so you can&#39;t imagine how
lucrative is illegal business has become
according to one estimation the illegal
organ market generates an profit of more
than 1 billion per year what can we do
about this how can we get more donor
kidneys and at the same time reduce the
black market abuses the solution is
ethical it&#39;s a simple but controversial
we should legalize the trade in kidneys
the problem is however that illegal
organ market has been deemed too
unethical and too controversial to
explore and implement most countries now
prohibit organ trading I believe if we
have to challenge these ideas allowing
organ payments may be a better solution
than strictly prohibiting them now let&#39;s
look at the reasons why organ trade has
been prohibited this first happened by
the World Health Organization in the
late 1980s why there are four reasons
organ payments are likely to take unfair
advantage of the poorest and most
vulnerable groups undermines altruistic
donation leads to profiteering and human
trafficking and conveys the idea that
people lack dignity that they are just
objects to be used by others so in short
we are not allowed to donate your organs
we are allowed to donate our organs but
we are not allowed to sell them the idea
is that if we allow organ payments then
it would harm the poor the vulnerable
and the poor would be the first in line
to sell their organs yet the evidence
shows that prohibition is not preventing
exploitation and trafficking in fact it
may be doing more harm than good in some
places it has driven the trade on the
ground it has increased the price of
organs making them more profitable to
sell and it has boosted the risk of
victimization
so prohibition is not working for those
people who are selling their kidneys of
the black market and it certainly isn&#39;t
working for patients who are dying on
the wait list other arguments in favor
of prohibition are also not well-founded
some people say that those who sell
their kidneys do so out of a lack of
free will
however the present situation has
already led to a lack of free will and
to exploitation and who are we anyway to
tell the poor that they can&#39;t sell their
organs
that they cannot make decisions for
themselves we say they are not allowed
to sell their organs but we don&#39;t offer
them alternatives to improve their
situation not allowing them to sell
leave them poor and let&#39;s look at the
idea that organ payments undermined
altruism there is no evidence for that
most people would sell their kidneys do
so out of basic needs the needs to
provide food and shelter for their
families the need to send their children
to school
those are pretty altruistic reasons
right payments are not at odds with
altruism it simply depends on what the
money is wanted for and speaking of
money economists have calculated that
the benefit to society of one living
kidney donation equals eighty thousand
euros so everyone profits from just one
live donation the economy the patient&#39;s
the hospital
the transplant doctors health insurance
companies everyone everyone but the
donor because he or she has to be
altruistic all that most donors receive
is a free lunch at a small travel
allowance to reach the hospital is that
fair and let&#39;s look at the idea that
organ sales are harmful not true organ
sales are not harmful per se it all
depends on the circumstances which makes
them hard which make them harmful a
transplant surgeon once told me that his
patient gave his girlfriend a boob job
in return for her kidney some would say
that&#39;s a pretty good good deal right I
think that&#39;s a pretty good deal and the
case that we studied in South Africa was
enlightening to donors were flown from
Brazil to South Africa to sell their
kidneys but some of them decided to
combine their kidney sales with Safari
holidays they went spotting the big five
and a few others use the money of their
kidney sales to buy surfboards
and they went surfing along to Durban
coastline these donors seem to be having
quite a good time over there they seemed
quite happy with the deal even if they
received far less than what the patients
paid should we regard these donors as
victims of exploitation or are they
parties to his to a business transaction
that share in the profit making but
still almost all countries still believe
prohibition is the way to go there is
one exception Iran Iran has a government
controlled program that rewards kidney
donors kidney donors receive cash and
benefits that can be as high as twice
the average annual individual income
their benefits include a one-year free
health insurance and free business loans
studies show that these donors are
generally quite satisfied with the
outcome of their sales they were able to
save a patient&#39;s life
and could use the money to set up a
business for example and they are
screened and receive proper medical
aftercare and there&#39;s more it is claimed
that Iran is the only country in the
world which performs transplantation and
has no waitlist the system is not
perfect though Iran allows donors and
patients to meet and they further
negotiate and drive up the price often
with help of middle people and
occasionally violent incidents and
conflicts do occur however these
incidents are nothing compared to the
scandals that take place on the black
market in countries that prohibit organ
trade I believe other countries should
follow Iran&#39;s example with four small
adaptations the government distributes
the kidneys anonymously according to the
same allocation principles that we have
now which means to the number-one
patients on the wait list all donors
receive the same amount I think 50
thousand euros is reasonable contact
sales and purchases between donors and
patients should be forbidden
and if there is resistance to the idea
of giving donors cash we can think of
other benefits such as a free lifelong
health insurance tax benefits or a
reduction of tuition education fees we
can start the Fair Trading kidneys as a
trial a trial that we monitor and adapt
as we go along all we need now is a
country that has to courage to start
such a trial all we need now are
politicians who have the guts to say
it&#39;s a disgrace that four hundred
thousand people are waiting for an organ
worldwide I am appalled that twenty
thousand patients die every year most of
which on an unnecessarily for whom an
organ could not be found on time let&#39;s
take one step beyond
let&#39;s save lives let&#39;s allow a fair
trade in kidneys thank you
