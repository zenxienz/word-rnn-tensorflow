fifteen years ago I ran my first and my
last marathon I found myself as a junior
transitioning to a senior in college and
my mom died of a cancer bout I was
orphaned at the age of 21 and I was
physically mentally and emotionally
fatter than I had ever been it was a
tough place to be and for six months I
soaked the day before Thanksgiving 2001
I went to our Wellness Center on North
Dakota State University&#39;s campus and I
got on a treadmill and for the first
time in my life I ran a mile things
jiggled everywhere and I was sweaty now
shoe and gravy and it just wasn&#39;t a
pretty sight but I did it
I ran the mile and I kept running and I
kept running and ten months later I ran
the Twin Cities Marathon now in the
process of that I found myself in the
summer of 2002 at West acres mall in
Fargo North Dakota searching for the
world&#39;s most powerful antiperspirant
because underneath this jacket right now
our pools of sweat and my armpits that I
would hope that the people in the front
row don&#39;t get affected from the splash
zone that&#39;s happening up here so I found
myself at Walgreens in West acres mall
here at Walgreens I was shopping for the
world&#39;s most powerful antiperspirant and
as I am looking through the through the
shelves
I hear the manager from down the aisle
yell stop stop and this guy my size now
is running full speed passed through the
through the hallway and my first
instinct as Eric pressed yourself
against the deodorants and
antiperspirants and protect yourself my
second thought was this is Eric you can
save them all and so as he drew closer I
went down and curled up into a turtle
shell position and he came at me at full
speed hitting me doing a 270 degree turn
landing what feels like 20 feet down the
aisle not affecting the feminine-hygiene
products on one side or the deodorant on
the other and I get up and I put my knee
in his chest and I said
folks I it saved them all
so the manager calls from all security
armed with walkie-talkies and
flashlights to protect and in walks two
people standing five feet tall the first
one a hundred pounds dripping wet the
second one three hundred pounds standing
next to each other they look like the
number ten now if you&#39;re not chubby shut
up don&#39;t laugh at that and they said we
have everything under control thanks so
much and I exited out of Walgreens and
made my way out with my bag of shoes in
tow I get no more than a hundred yards
from the door of Walgreens and I again
hear that same manager yell stop stop
somebody stop him mall security could
not detain this person with their
flashlights and walkie-talkies and he
had sprung three and remember I&#39;m in
marathon shape at this point and I had
saved the mall once and I won&#39;t save it
again so I throw down my bag of shoes I
hear the Baywatch theme playing in the
back of my head and I go on a dead
sprint towards this guy wearing leather
Doc Martens strap on sandals I think you
know what even if he&#39;s the fastest guy
in town I bet he&#39;s not in marathon shape
and unless he&#39;s Forrest Gump i mo catch
him and so I find myself running and I
catch up to him without much hesitation
and when I get within about 5 feet of
him I see him in front of me digging in
his pocket and I&#39;m thinking this guy has
a gun or a knife or a sharp number-two
pencil and I said I got to do something
so I put on the afterburners and I run
up to him and I rip his arm out of his
pockets I grabbed with my other arm and
I put him in a chokehold with this I
jump up into the air all 240 pounds of
my frame at that time and I wrapped my
legs around him and I rip him to the
ground and then I stretch and he lets
out a noise like this
he says to me I have asthma because he
was reaching for his inhaler the real
cops showed up I went to the hospital I
bruised my ribs from when he hit me in
Walgreens I go back the next day to give
them the hospital bill
I go back the next day to expect to see
it renamed hatch greens to be given a
sash that says savior of them all and
instead I got a $50 gift certificate to
Red Lobster which was lovely now I was
22 years old at the time and I realized
that at that crucial part of my life
that I was drawn to do good in this
world I wanted to make an impact I
wanted to be a part of something awesome
I got to do that with my life and then
this transition point comes in our lives
when we go from working being in school
and being wide eyed and bushy tailed so
we get smack dab put in the middle of
the real world and the real world and
the businesses that we&#39;re a part of are
either nonprofits or for profits there
are places that do good or places that
focus on profit and herein lies this
inner conflict now I actually think that
most of us want to be a part of
something bigger than ourselves that
were called to do good it&#39;s a part of
the way were developed it&#39;s our design
to serve it&#39;s our design to do good and
to be a part of something bigger was my
craving for a business so after college
I went to work for a non-profit I went
to work for the church that I was
baptized and raised in and I got paid to
have fun and I got paid to do epic
things I got paid to make an impact now
I didn&#39;t get paid a lot but I got paid
to do things that were natural to my
being right I was a part of something
bigger because I was affecting the lives
of young people and they certainly were
affecting my life I was working for a
non-profit and I had purpose and I had
passion and then I had bills right
and so I transitioned after eight years
to a life in real estate I opened up my
own business and all of a sudden I
started to lose my identity naively I
lost my identity because I thought that
the for-profit world had to be literally
for-profit and I thought that this
nonprofit world was something that I had
to leave behind when realistically I
believe we can have our cake and eat it
too but I found myself working in the
for-profit world and I grew a big
business and I grew it fast I was given
awards and recognition and had money and
all these things and I was dying on the
inside
in fact I became the poster child of
failure because I got kicked out I had
all these people in my life that left me
because that was a flaming hot dumpster
fire I was in authentic to who I was
created to because I was created to do
something good I still wanted to be that
person that saved them all and now I was
only caring about myself
and I failed you see the foundation of a
non-profit is you&#39;re there to solve a
problem where the foundation of a
for-profit traditionally is for profit
herein lies attention but I believe that
we can actually merge these two together
and have the heart of a non-profit exist
in a for-profit it comes with two things
the first is a purpose this purpose is
passion this purpose is that thing
inside you that says I need to do more
than just the average Joe this business
has to be more about pushing numbers and
making money there has to be more to it
and the second is people now you have
three ways in which I think to create
the business that you want with the same
kind of heartbeat that you&#39;re craving
the first is to get kicked out I would
not recommend that for anybody but I got
kicked out and I was given the gift of
starting over the second is to start a
new business something that doesn&#39;t
exist and to build it with purpose at
the foundation but the final piece where
most of us will find ourselves is caught
a place that&#39;s good but not great my
channel she was to create a side hustle
this side hustle is a unique and
incredible way to all of a sudden find
like-minded people ask your co-workers
hey do you want to get involved in this
party planning committee and you&#39;ll find
the partiers in your group right ask
your co-workers and your team members
are you drawn to a book study or a Bible
study and you&#39;ll find like-minded people
the conversations a lot of our
businesses are missing right now is who
else wants to come and do good and when
you get two or more gather together you
have the ability to multiply your
efforts and therein lies the site hustle
this side hustle is not the foundation
of your business it&#39;s rather literally a
gig on the side it&#39;s an extracurricular
activity and so find a way to serve find
a way if you care about kids in the sex
trafficking industry start a side hustle
with it if you care about abused women
and children start a side hustle about
it if your heart is for the homeless
your business can have that side hustle
in it and then here&#39;s the fun part is
that side hustles heartbeat starts to
infuse the heartbeat of your regular
business there in merging the two after
a period of time but in addition to that
when you put people in a side hustle and
you give them purpose you get to avoid
the just I&#39;m just a realtor I&#39;m just a
secretary I&#39;m just a banker I&#39;m just a
cosmetologist it&#39;s more than that
because you have purpose with what
you&#39;re doing now my friend Nick shivers
in Portland Oregon and I started a side
hustle we started a movement called sell
a home save a child which takes this if
you were to buy or sell a house with us
we&#39;re going to donate money in your name
at closing and we&#39;re going to pay it
forward to help save kids from garbage
dumps in the sex trade industry and
massive poverty around the world
we started this side hustle in Nick
is far more advanced than I am yet he
now says that his mission for his
company and he&#39;s one of the top realtors
in the country that have the mission for
his company is to sell homes and save
kids he tells his clients that he tells
his future and current team members that
and wouldn&#39;t you believe the law of
attraction for him is enormous people
are drawn to him because of purpose
because of character because he&#39;s
finally living in a business that&#39;s for
profit yet has the heart of a non profit
now I first said it purpose is the thing
that we have to pay attention to but the
second are people if you work at a
non-profit and if you work and represent
sell a home save a child I promise you
that you will do anything within your
power to help that little girl to make
sure that the guys that drive the
garbage trunks will no longer take
advantage of this girl you&#39;ll go to the
ends of the earth to protect her because
she&#39;s worth it and sometimes when we get
in our businesses we think that the
people that we care for are our clients
and yes they matter but the people that
matter even more so are our team members
that we will go to the ends of the earth
for our team members that we will give
them grace and we will give them
relentless pursuit of love and affection
and we will help them with whatever it
takes because the foundation always is
God and family but after that is your
team then clients then community in that
order and when you can give relentlessly
and a for profit to your team your goal
is to change lives the fun part is is
that it&#39;s your life that gets changed in
the process right I always thought I
wanted to have this incredible
autobiography about my life I wanted to
have the book of all books where Eric
hatch did all these things and was just
like super awesome and traveled and had
all these incredible adventures and
there is great value in that but my
friend Mark Anderson in Fargo challenged
me and he said wouldn&#39;t
better to be a chapter in everybody
else&#39;s book and I went oh yeah if you
want to be a chapter in everybody else&#39;s
book you need to find an aligned purpose
if you want to be a chapter in everybody
else&#39;s book you need to treat your team
like you&#39;d treat the least of these and
that is give everything that you can so
that they have a better chance at the
end of the day if you&#39;re privileged to
work in a business whether it be
for-profit or nonprofit it&#39;s not your
team that works for you rather it&#39;s you
that works for your team god bless
