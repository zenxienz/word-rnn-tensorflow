so are you blind a common question that
I usually get asked when somebody tries
to have a conversation with me about why
I started white print so did one of your
friends or a member of your family
inspire you to start a venture of this
nature and when they don&#39;t get any
interesting answers from me
they actually resolved to listening to
my actual backstory it was a night in
2012 when I was just reflecting upon the
day and I thought about what is it that
the visually impaired started there
David firstly for me I love my newspaper
every morning if it&#39;s even if it just
means ten minutes of you know breathing
through the pages I didn&#39;t find any
answers I looked up online to answer my
curiosity I picked up the phone in the
middle of the night spoke to a couple of
friends they thought I was being crazy I
went to the National Association for the
blind which is one of the largest
organizations working for the visually
impaired here in India and I requested
them to connect me to a few visually
impaired individuals for me to take my
journey researching about what I was
looking for
I&#39;d conducted thorough research for
about three months and I was convinced
that it was time for me to quit my job
and start a magazine and commit myself
to creating and giving my thought you
know a concrete structure in May 2013 we
started in this first English lifestyle
magazine and Braille white print we
cover everything right from politics
literature art Bollywood fashion
inspiring stories of the common man and
they even invite our readers to write
about anything that might interest them
a magazine is circulated across India in
schools colleges offices old-age homes a
lot of libraries and of course
Institute&#39;s that cater specifically to
the needs of the visually impaired and
our youngest readers 12 and our oldest
is 80 what we also realized in our pro
says of speaking to the community was we
were not going to make this a charity
venture we realized that the community
was tired of being sympathized with and
this of course took us to the root of
advertising we approached a lot of
corporate and shared our idea we knew
there&#39;ll be a lot of resistance and a
lot of hesitancy from them because they
had not really created advertising
material that was catering only
specifically to the visually impaired
till today but over time we realized
that they were not only excited about
the idea but they also wanted to
experiment we&#39;ve had corporates like
Tatas Mahindra&#39;s coca-cola pit Delight
Aircel Vodafone who&#39;ve come ahead and
created specific ads for instance coke
went a step ahead and they made these
musical ads for us very no it was just
like those musical cards when you open
the magazine the song would start
playing and I thrilled our readers pity
light recently created a very
interesting copy driven ad specifically
for our magazine for ferry call what we
realized through this journey of you
know evolving the magazine was that
there was a lot that needed to be done
in order to create awareness about
Braille literacy music in our belief is
supposed to be really strong in
conveying a message and we created a
short music film B for Braille which
I&#39;ll show you at the end of the
presentation you know took to spread
awareness of course spreading awareness
was the first step to action and to
tackle the issue from its foundation we
created Braille tactile alphabet books
to activate our released last year we
understood that the quality of Braille
printing has been constantly criticized
by our readers and to counter that we
came up with the Polli Braille
technology we use that and print
attacked a bit which gives the permanent
nature to the dots and tactile outlines
to every alphabet so we did that in
Hindi and English we what if we were
catering only to
visually impaired and we realized that
the images had to be clear but we also
focused on detailing to give them on
very integrated fun learning experience
in a National Institute of Design a
graduate Neha created these specific
designs for them and now the book is
used not only by the visually impaired
but kids with low vision with multiple
disabilities with complete loss of sight
across the country oh we learnt that
kids in schools in catering to the
visually impaired they teach them shapes
with a piece of thread that&#39;s when
you&#39;re not activate proved to be a great
learning resource of fun integrated
learning because one of my proofreaders
at nab told me that she is blind and her
kids were sighted so at a very early age
she had to appoint a tutor for her
children and she could not enjoy that
learning process with her children and
she said that if I had resources like
this it would be fun learning experience
for both my child and me but that
couldn&#39;t happen back then to counter
that dr. Pat has been highly appreciated
but what we also learned was that our
journey was not stopping there it was it
has been truly you know sort of a great
learning experience for us because we
understand that Abdo we are talking to
the visually impaired there is a sense
of change of perception that we need to
create among other people who saw you
know sort of have ignored this community
to a very very large extent and these
are some of the pictures of the schools
that have already started using tactimon
and we really you know enjoyed the whole
process of actually going to school and
getting the child to feel each shape
because till today if you know if I were
to tell my child and my child was blind
that you know a for Apple and you know I
have to get a fruit in front of you or I
could take a book and give that
experience that all other sided children
are getting in schools today I&#39;ll end
with a short music film but I also like
to end with them
message that you know this is just the
beginning these are very very small
steps that we have taken there&#39;s a lot
that needs to be done there&#39;s a lot that
we want to do in creating a much more
fun-filled learning experience for a
visually impaired child and moreover we
all need to start you know making a
society more inclusive in every form
that we can I&#39;m going to leave you with
the short music film b4 Braille
