good afternoon everyone
thank you for the opportunity so I&#39;m
shafte I work for a startup called
Utah where we try to use machine
learning and AI technology along with
human summer service assistance to try
and improve the user experience of any
product and service so I want to get a
bit talk a bit more about what it&#39;s what
artificial intelligences are like it&#39;s
something that came like seems to be
making exponential growth almost every
single week almost every day they exist
it seems to be like a new news about
like something great on AI but it is
something really new well not
necessarily like some of these ideas
have been around for a long time in
science fiction and even in reality like
the term AI was first used in the 1950s
so what happened after 1950s this is
almost 2020 like what happened with the
AI in between like why is there a sudden
it&#39;s like explosion of AI now well
basically what happened was that
computers have gotten extremely powerful
and comparatively cheaper over the years
which which enabled like the AI
algorithms to process a larger amount of
data more efficiently and come up with
better results so but at the core how
does AI work well the idea of AI is
actually quite simple you take a lot of
data you analyze the data you try and
find patterns in existing data and using
those patterns you try and predict
future patterns what might happen in the
future like how previous history might
affect your future outcome and based on
that you can make certain decisions to
help your daily job daily
and based on those decisions you again
feed the computer with your feedback
which helps the computer algorithms to
make even better predictions in the
future so why is it important like why
do we need to know about AI like is it
something only the tech guys should know
about is it something that should
concern everyone well let&#39;s see let&#39;s
try and see how a I can help in
different industries and then figure out
like who should be talking about AI
let&#39;s think about retail
what can a I do in detail I&#39;ll give you
a very simple example like of an AI that
we all have used for a long time like
whenever we make any purchases online
you know how the site gives you
suggestions related products people you
might also like to buy this product
that&#39;s a very very basic form of AI and
that has been around for the last twenty
years now over the years as you can like
a few guys are purchasing products
online you probably notice like nowadays
the suggestions are very very personal
like it can actually suggest the actual
product you might be looking for and
sometimes we do end up buying those
products yep and how does the computer
know this how does it know that I&#39;m if I
buy monitor I might need a keyboard how
does it know it basically checks through
your previous purchases so it probably
knows that you already have our computer
you already have a mouse but you don&#39;t
have a keyboard or our or a miter and
then it suggests you it looks at
patterns of what your friends are buying
so if your friends are buying a
particular type of jeans it will
automatically suggest you if you would
like to buy the same kind of a jeans and
it and this also helps the sellers
basically it helps them to better
predict their inventory and reduces cost
of storing a lot of inventory and it it
kind of increases their sales as well
like sometimes we end up buying more
than
we actually initially thought of but
then again if the if the accuracy of
those suggestions are right we&#39;ll
probably end up making smarter purchases
let&#39;s talk about another industry
farming I think like most people
wouldn&#39;t associate AI with farming I
think I hope that I&#39;m wrong but in
farming AI can increase productivity
exponentially think about how we plant
crops nowadays in Bangladesh like we
kind of follow the same kind of pattern
every single year if who you are growing
right for the next five years or till
after an amount of time you will be
growing rice but what if we could let
the farmers give give them more tools
and more suggestions and as to what to
plant and how much earnings they&#39;re
gonna they can expect at the end of the
year and what if we also considered data
from like weather reports population
reports and determine like which kind of
products will be more in demand in the
coming year and based on that if the
farmer does his a job so big it
increases the farms productivity it can
increase the sustainability of the land
and also it can did a like up it can
influence like how the entire farming
sector or the farming economy grows over
time City Planning can I help here well
definitely like in every modern city
nowadays we have tons of cameras or
sensors everywhere traffic lights and
tons of data on population and how the
population is growing and all the other
information can be processed through an
AI algorithm to predict how the city
would change in say 10 years 20 years or
even 50 years in in the future and based
on that data or based on that analysis
we can plan out like how many
Rhodes we might need how many schools or
part or recreational centers we might
need in the future
what kind of demography would our city
have in like 50 years time based on that
we can decide like if if there will be
more need for commercial space retail
space or even houses right even if we go
into houses would would the population
of the city be single-unit houses or
larger apartments we can all predict
this using a customer service like this
is something we&#39;re kind of working at
would I like trying to improve the
customer service experience so like how
can how can it really help here
basically like whenever we call customer
service number usually we&#39;d end up
waiting for some time for the
representative to go through my file and
then find out exactly what the problem
is and then come up with a solution but
that&#39;s like we did as quick like a small
study like and we found out that if one
person is calling about a product with a
particular kind of issue chances are
someone else before him has already
called regarding the same problem and
chances are the company already has a
proper solution for that problem so
whenever a new customer is calling the
companies no longer have to wait to go
through the entire process of finding on
what the problem is and then figuring or
the solution like they have a solution
ready just the moment the customer
contacts them and this reduces wait time
this reduces time at queues and overall
improve the experience of the customer
how about healthcare we are already
seeing like the benefits of AI in
healthcare like with like with AI like
in health care we can now like doctors
can now design specific medicines to
target specific cases in patients that
kind of you reduces the risk of side
effects from generic medicine and also
like instead of giving them a fixed
prescription for the medicine they can
tweak those prescriptions to meet the
patient&#39;s exact medical condition and
that way it reduces the chances of like
any misdiagnosis right and when just a
few days back Google showed Adem on on
how it&#39;s AI cameras are working to
improve medical healthcare so with just
our phone camera like we can take
pictures of human eye and detect early
conditions of our diabetes just from a
picture with a smartphone and that is
only possible with the AI algorithms
construction work definitely nowadays
there are already a algorithms in use
which can predict the cost of a building
or the environmental impact of that
building just by scanning the blueprint
like that&#39;s mind blowing like even five
ten years back this would have been
science fiction just going just like
scanning a blueprint of a building we
can figure out how much it might cost we
can figure out what the building might
look like in ten years or twenty years
time and we can figure out what
environmental impact that structure is
having in the sounding area well what
I&#39;m trying to get to is that like AI is
not really only limited to computer
science it&#39;s it is actually everywhere
we are already using it even if we don&#39;t
realize it like we all like there
already automated cars like which drives
itself like Tesla and they are coming up
with automated trucks and lorries and
all this stuff which will run completely
autonomously on their own we have
earphones now which can translate in
your time at least 40 different
languages and this is gonna be this is
only gonna get better and better over
time and enjoying one of the professor&#39;s
like pioneers of computer science and AI
technology in particular
he has this quote like in the early days
of AI like just as Industrial Revolution
freed us up from the burdens of physical
labor the AI Revolution has the
potential to free us from the mental
labor so we can all rely on computers
more and more to make better decisions
for us which we can use to like even
improve the AIS performance further in
the future the AI revolution is not
really a few not something that&#39;s going
to happen in the future it&#39;s already
happening it&#39;s already we are already
experiencing the AI revolution and in
five to ten years time it will be like a
part of life so I hope that by by that
time we as a country would be ready to
embrace AI not only in computer science
but in all aspects of life say be it in
construction and building city planning
medicine any kind of industry thank you
