what do you think of bankers it&#39;s a
rhetorical question do you know any are
you one I do you think that they cheat
and if they cheat
is that because banking attracts cheats
or it creates them well a few years ago
a team of behavioural economists from
Switzerland set out to answer that very
question they gathered together a
hundred and twenty eight bankers and
split them into two groups 64 in each
they then asked primed the first group
with questions about their personal
lives their families their hobbies that
they loved or did they hate reality
television
the second group they primed them with
questions about their work their roles
and responsibilities at the bank they
then asked everyone in both groups to
toss a coin 10 times and to record the
results but they added this important
rider you will get 20 dollars for every
head that you record you get nothing for
any tails so what did they find well you
would expect if it was pure chance and
there was no cheating that there would
be pretty even numbers of heads and
tails and indeed with the first group
that&#39;s what they found 640 tosses almost
even heads and tails but with the second
group the results were quite different
many more heads than tails now this this
is a statistically significant deviation
from pure chance and it led the
researchers to the conclusion that
bankers thinking banking thoughts are
more willing to cheat dishonesty in
banking and finance is a breach of trust
it&#39;s a breach of our trust in banks that
they&#39;re honest and ethical and that the
financial system as a whole is fair a
force for good and not evil and indeed
it was this good not evil thing that got
me a human rights law professor
interested in global finance in the
first place more than 10 years ago I
wanted to better understand how finance
operates and what sort of impact it has
on
human rights and it&#39;s been a daunting
challenge not just because so few people
outside finance really understand how
the system works but because so many
people inside finance struggle to
explain what it is that they do bankers
will point to sophisticated mathematical
models for predicting the financial
future but ultimately none of those
models can handle the sheer
unpredictability of what we human beings
do with our money the biggest challenge
of all though is to try and harness the
immense power of finance to do more that
helps human rights rather than harms
them and to help them more like this
finance has helped to create the wealth
that has fueled this spectacular drop in
global poverty from a position in 1990
when nearly 40% of the world&#39;s
population lived in abject poverty - a
position today where it&#39;s less than 10%
now that 10% still represents more than
700 million people living on less than
one point nine dollars a day but at
least we are moving in the right
direction where finance has pushed us in
the wrong direction is in the matter of
distribution of wealth the world today
is richer than it has ever been before
and yet so much of that wealth is
concentrated in the hands of so few the
richest 1% of the world&#39;s population now
possess more wealth than the other 99%
so while it is true that the financial
system has helped the poor a little it&#39;s
helped the rich a whole lot more
economists call this the trickle-down
effect but there you go that&#39;s it it&#39;s a
trickle and it&#39;s no accident the
financial system is designed this way
there&#39;s a revolving door between finance
and our lawmakers Wall Street today
occupies government&#39;s and has persuaded
our leaders to believe that what is good
for finance good for the wealthy is good
for the rest of the economy banks big
banks in particular have become a sort
of protected species
they&#39;re encouraged to take enormous
risks and if those risks pay off they
get to keep the profits but if they go
horribly wrong the state steps in and
bails the might it&#39;s a bit like having a
cat as a pet you think you owners are in
reality it owns you tax laws are a vivid
example of a rigged financial system why
do you think it is that multinational
corporations are able so successfully to
avoid paying tax by shifting their
profits and losses across the globe well
they can because it&#39;s legal
it may be unethical it may be unfair but
it is not illegal in fact the reason why
our tax laws are so incredibly long is
because they contain so many complicated
tax deductions for those rich enough to
be able to claim them the United States
tax code is four million words long
that&#39;s seven times the length of
Tolstoy&#39;s war and peace or four times
the length of all the Harry Potter
novels put together but whatever it&#39;s an
awful lot of tax breaks warren buffett
tells this story of asking everyone in
his office to note down their annual
income tax rate so this is secretaries
janitors middle management and Buffett
himself and when the results come back
it is Warren Buffett the world&#39;s second
richest human being that is paying the
lowest income tax rate by far so the
financial fat cats have got their cream
and we&#39;ve let them have it indeed are we
complicit in this crime
so seduced have we become by finance and
money
we&#39;ve reached we&#39;ve reached a position
today where we live our lives like Oscar
Wilde&#39;s definition of a cynic we know
the price of everything in the value of
nothing an Adid everything does seem to
have a price tag these days we will sell
our spare rooms to strangers for a night
we&#39;ve turned our private cars into
public taxis some people sell their
kidneys and other people sell their
children and then there&#39;s this guy in
the you now
States who sold his forehead for
advertising space for a month for thirty
seven thousand three hundred and seventy
five dollars most of all we&#39;ve allowed
money to become the measure of all that
we achieve in life and it may be that
the rich are particularly clever or
they&#39;re very greedy or they&#39;re just very
lucky
but whatever we venerate them as symbols
of success in our society and then our
eagerness to emulate them we binge on
debt and thereby we&#39;ve allowed banks to
effectively control our lives so we&#39;ve
created a monster and just like dr.
Frankenstein we&#39;ve come to regret the
creation our levels of distrust of banks
have reached epic proportions in a
recent global survey barely fifty
percent of us believed that banks were
trustworthy institutions when we
describe banks we use words like
unethical arrogant socially useless and
my personal favorite a giant vampire
squid wrapped around the face of
humanity our views of banks and bankers
have become so jaundiced that we now
expect bankers to cheat now this is not
how it should be banking should be a
pillar of society not some sort of
sheltered workshop for bankers so we&#39;ve
got to reclaim finance for the sake of
society and for the sake of bankers
we&#39;ve got to rewrite the mission
statement of Finance so that social
responsibility is not seen as some sort
of optional extra but it&#39;s part of the
core business of banking and that
bankers are made to take responsibility
for the wider consequences of their
action rather than be excused them as
they are today
the banks can do this because bankers
are men and women just like you and me
they have passions and desires and they
need to be respected like everyone else
I remember this one executive top
executive banker telling me that when he
looks at himself in the mirror in the
morning he wants to be proud of what it
is that he does that day
we can work with this we could appeal to
the better angel with in banking and
there is one for I&#39;ve seen over the
years how access to financial services
has fueled that dramatic decline in
poverty that we saw earlier how in the
poor remittances this is money sent back
by family members working overseas have
been lifelines for those back home how
in the Pacific Islands micro financing
programs have helped to unlock the
wealth creating potential of the poor
and particularly of women and how in
Myanmar Indonesia and even China a small
but growing band of ethical investors
are trying to better protect the
environment and here in the West the
growth of social impact investing the
idea that you can do good and make a
profit at the same time is being used to
protect and promote human rights so
there&#39;s an enormous potential within
finance to help everyone in society and
not just a privileged view but for that
potential to be exploited we have got to
change our attitudes and expectations of
banks and bankers be less tolerant and
accepting of ideas and cultures of
entitlement selfishness of greed and
more demanding that banks give back more
than they take banks after all are the
servants of society not its master and
so my message and it&#39;s been a long time
coming might my message to banks is
simple and it is this ask not what
society can do for you but what you can
do for society and that&#39;s what banks o
us
you
