and I&#39;m slightly disappointed but my
still my dream to go to the Amazon was
alive and kicking during my
undergraduate course in the University
of Kent I was studying conservation
biology all of us have to do a
dissertation that would you know result
into a research project for your third
year degree I chose my research project
in India but later on I got to know that
there was an opportunity to go to Peru
at the place where the river Amazon
originates to do your research I
immediately went to my supervisor and I
said listen I have already done my
fieldwork in India but I still want to
go to the Amazon he said no no no you
can&#39;t go you know you&#39;ve you&#39;ve already
finished and you know we have very
little funding we can&#39;t fund you to go
to there I said listen I have like years
of experience working on camera trucks
and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re you know you
have camera tops there and you&#39;re
working on Jaguars I&#39;m sure I can help
in some of the other way fortunately I
could convince him and he said okay fine
you know we&#39;ll take you along but you
really have to work hard it&#39;s like
absolutely
so finally was off and that&#39;s the first
picture I took of the Amazon River from
an airplane we had to land in this small
city called as Iquitos which has no land
route you have to land there the
airplane has to land in water and it was
quite intimidating at first the Amazon
incidentally is according to discharge
just by the volume of water greater than
the next seven rivers combined so you
can imagine how big that river could be
and it has a very huge basin as well
most people think that the Amazon
originated
Brazil and everything to do with the
Amazon is in Brazil but actually the
Amazon originates in Peru
right so I stayed on that thing for over
six months in that&#39;s that&#39;s a research
vessel deep in the Amazon I mean at
first I was like what am i doing you
know i wireman on this board for months
together we used to get you know we were
land sick you know because the the that
little boat was anchored at one place
for a really really long time so so yeah
we used to stay on that cook on that do
a research on that every morning go in
in the mornings in the forest to look
for you know different species that we
would encounter this would be our early
morning seems every morning we would
make up two scenes like this sipping
coffee for breakfast and there would be
a group of my cause that would fly by so
I was totally living my dream very very
weird looking frogs that I&#39;d never seen
before that&#39;s a clown frog and very
weird looking birds as well that&#39;s a
bird called the Hawaiin which lives in
the Amazon in the entire region also
some of my you know Co colleagues were
working on crocodiles the the crocodiles
over there are called Caymans
you know and that&#39;s a black came and
then they would they would put in a pipe
inside its mouth and feed it with lots
of water and then after a certain point
just in what the you know Cayman and
like shake it as if you know it&#39;s like
some dumping bags what the crowd the
Cayman would do is puke out the remains
of its stomach and they would collect
the puke and determine what&#39;s the Cayman
is eating so it was the research was on
what the Caymans are eating and how that
sort of affects their breeding biology
at first I was like oh my god like you
know what is this dealing with puke and
all of this but later on I found out
that it has immense value and research
because they found that the Caymans are
eating a certain kind of fish that was
getting depleted day by day due to
overfishing in that landscape that&#39;s how
we would walk you know with almost
knee-deep of water sometimes
and every time I would step foot in the
Amazon in the rainforest there would be
like a swarm of mosquitoes that would
surround me so you could not get into
that landscape without some core the
kind of DEET or like insecticide on you
really unhealthy but if you didn&#39;t have
it you would you&#39;d probably get eat like
you know eaten alive by mosquitoes so my
research basically looked at how during
the flooding season large mammals like
and especially big cats like Jaguars you
know how do they move around in the
entire landscape when the entire area is
flooded so in the Amazon you know it&#39;s
very different that landscape is very
different from India or Africa where you
could see through the forest for over
you know 10 meters 15 meters over there
you have visibility of like one meter
the jaguar might be sitting right next
to you and you wouldn&#39;t know about it so
there was it was impossible to actually
see animals you know while walking so
that&#39;s where ecologists or biologists
use these devices called as camera traps
now camera trap is a very interesting
device where you would attach a camera
it&#39;s a it&#39;s a remote camera that gets
triggered by infrared rays on to sort of
you know substrate on your own Road and
any animal that crosses the camera the
camera gets triggered and takes a
picture of that animal so we get to know
what kinds of animals there are what are
the densities of the animal what are the
abundances of the animal and then you
know do some statistical modeling to
find out how the animals are doing how
how are they spatially distributed
throughout the landscape so that&#39;s me
putting a camera trap and at night when
you know when animals would move and we
check our camera traps we would get
these really interesting pictures so
this is the animal called as a tapir
that&#39;s found only in the Amazon
rainforest and in Malaysia but that&#39;s a
different species you get there that&#39;s a
puma okay and when I saw this picture
for the first time I was like it was

11:30 a.m. and this picture was clicked

at 11:27 a.m. so you know that Puma was
right around us said at that point so we
were pretty through that&#39;s a Jaguar okay
so we were you know we are very lucky to
get about fifty six different
individuals in
span of about four to five months in
that landscape and we found out through
a research that Jaguars in that region
where during flooding season would
converge onto these small islands
because all the other spray spray
species like what they prey on like the
tapir there is a red rocket deer
armadillos also would come into these
little islands that would form so in
like a small size of about 50 square
kilometers you could find up to tell 20
to 12 different Jaguars which was pretty
cool but that was not you know what sort
of made me change my career path a
little and study humans rather than
animals when I when I first saw this
that&#39;s a bullet cartridge in India
Amazon I was shocked I was like you know
what there are hunters here there are
poachers here like what&#39;s happening I
was very surprised so I went into the
markets you know I made friends with a
local cop and I told him that you know I
want to go undercover and I want to find
out what&#39;s happening and I want to take
these pictures of you know these people
selling the you know animal products
that&#39;s a lot of monkey meat ok and
monkey meat is a local delicacy over
there
when I saw that for the first time I
cringed what these people eat monkeys
they look like us and they&#39;re eating
like you know these things and I was I
was judging them totally later on I
found out that I was very wrong because
this is the practice that has existed
for a very very long time
and eating animals in the Amazon or
forget the Amazon even in India is a
very normal thing and and and there&#39;s
nothing wrong with it so not just not
just monkey meat you know they would eat
they would make these you know skins out
of anaconda skin a large catfish stuff
then there&#39;s there&#39;s caiman skin over
there so a lot of animals were being
used okay for different purposes this
was slightly problematic because this
was more of a commercial purpose this is
for you know especially foreign tourists
coming and you know when they when they
see something that exotic they&#39;re like
oh I want to get this and when they
lined up
in Washington DC Airport they get going
to jail because international trade does
not allow them to carry something like
that but that&#39;s what sort of drives
markets like these so those are skulls
of monkeys as well that&#39;s a Fowler
monkey a capuchin monkey another howler
monkey which you know local co comma
tribals is a tribal community over there
called the co comas they&#39;re about only
ten to fifteen thousand of them left in
the world okay so they are they are a
threatened tribe as well they regularly
hunt monkeys and other animals for the
daily requirements because you know over
there agriculture is not possible and
they don&#39;t get the dietary requirement
of protein comes from bushmeat hunting
and which is very normal because they
don&#39;t seem to be having a very large
effect on the ecology or the environment
because they themselves are a part of
the ecosystem the problem is when
something like this happens okay this is
you know I found you know in a very
dingy corner of a market in Iquitos
where a Jaguar skin was kept and I
really wanted to go in there and find
out like you know what the prices are
and what drives this trade that was very
risky because five minutes later I had
like ten people with machetes running
behind me and I had to take you know
take police protection but I found out
that something like that sells for just
around twenty to forty dollars locally
the same thing if it would you know was
marketed in America or in China that
would sell for about forty thousand
dollars so you see like how end-user
markets are driving trades like this so
you know at that point when I was
speaking to this fellow I you know I
judged him they&#39;re like you know this is
the guy who&#39;s doing the hunting but
later on when I when I did a little
research on this and I found out the the
chain the market chain and how it
actually results in to driving forces to
kill rare wildlife I found out that the
people who consumed these things are the
problem at one point while you know just
when I was back and sitting in a in a
small town just
in the evening I saw a small canoe
coming from the forest there were four
or three or four Co commas in there with
two little kids and they they just came
up to me and started crying you know
obviously in Latin American Spanish and
I couldn&#39;t speak Latin American Spanish
at that point I could understand a
little bit of it they were crying
because they just lost their entire
family murdered by goons of an oil and
natural-gas sort of an organization
which are doing exploration in the
Amazon when I read around a little about
that I found out that it was an
organization that was based in the
United States of America which would
drill for oil for requirements on
consumers in in America and elsewhere we
don&#39;t really realize these things that
what what is the kind of effect that we
as consumers have on on local
communities and on wildlife far from
where we live and I would like to end
with that that I you know I live my
childhood dream but also realize a lot
many things that I didn&#39;t okay thanks
