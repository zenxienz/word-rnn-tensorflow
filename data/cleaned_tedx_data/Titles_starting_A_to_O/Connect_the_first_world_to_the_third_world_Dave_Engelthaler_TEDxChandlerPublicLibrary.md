I&#39;m a genomic epidemiologist which is
just a fancy way of saying that I study
the DNA of pathogens and microbes to try
and stop or prevent infectious diseases
it also means that I have lots of cool
and amazing and sometimes pretty gross
stories to tell but today I just want to
talk about three things first why I hate
statistics second why now is the right
time to connect the first world to the
so-called third world and third how Tom
Cruise can help save the world from
tuberculosis so the first thing why I
hate statistics well to say that I hate
statistics kind of makes me a
self-hating epidemiologist because stats
is our brand you guys have seen all the
health news headlines there&#39;s usually
some kind of statistic involved such as
drinking coffee decreases your risk of
diabetes by seven percent for every cup
per day or laughing can increase your
lifespan by up to eight years or most
amazingly in vitro fertilization rates
can be increased by 16 percent when
being entertained by a clown no I did
not make that up and kale makes you 33%
more annoying to your friends
I did make that one up but there&#39;s all
sorts of health statistics about red
wine right
red wine decreases your risk of heart
disease by 30 percent red wine also
decreases your risk of colon cancer by
45 percent and moderate drinkers have a
32 percent lower risk of developing
cataracts than non-drinkers you could
tell there&#39;s a lot of red wine being
drunk in my house which reminds me that
drinking absolutely increases your risk
of pregnancy by a thousand percent
believe me I know just saying baby
number three but you really have an
epidemiologist to thank for all of these
statistics that are you know frequently
confusing sometimes conflicting
oftentimes meaningless so why do we use
statistics if we know that they can be
bent or melded in any direction or any
way to make an argument well as a
harvard math professor fred Mosteller
once famously noted sure it is easy to
lie with statistics but it&#39;s much easier
to lie without it so that&#39;s why we use
statistics to be just an inkling better
than the Liars who make crap up like I
did with that kale thing but these are
not the kind of Statistics that I hate
the kind I hate are the kind that keep
me awake at night such as one third of
the world&#39;s population is infected with
tuberculosis that&#39;s a true statistic
that&#39;s scary as hell but it&#39;s probably
even worse than that because sure in the
u.s. that number is definitely less than
5% but in places in South Africa in two
locations in India that number can be
more than 80% think of an 80% of people
infected with TB it reminds me of the
walking dead virus where the whole
planet gets infected but it&#39;s not to
suggest that just suddenly one third of
the world&#39;s population is going to drop
dead from tuberculosis but it does mean
that they have the TB bacteria in their
lungs walled off somewhere so that
someday if they get sick when they get
old and their immunity starts to wane or
they get HIV they will also get pummeled
tbh so one-third of the world&#39;s
population of seven-and-a-half billion
people that&#39;s 2 billion 500 million
people walking around with TB in their
lungs what the hell are we gonna do
about that but this is still not the
statistic that I hate the most the one I
hate the most is that one person one
fellow human being dies every 17 seconds
from tuberculosis since I started
talking another 10 or 12 people are dead
by the time I finish that&#39;ll be another
15 or 20 people dead and by this time
tomorrow more than 5,000 more fellow
humans will be dead from TB and that&#39;s a
statistic we can all hate so this leads
me to my second thing why now is the
right time to connect first world
solutions to third world problems a
sidenote much of what we call the third
world used to be the first world because
for a thousand years they were the
leaders in cultural and scientific and
technological advancements and they can
be again and they probably will be but
let me get back to my point one of my
life codes is we have the ability
therefore we have the responsibility and
I happen to be lucky enough to work for
a nonprofit cutting-edge genomics
Research Institute where we&#39;re dedicated
to taking advancements in genomic
science and making great impacts on
human health
we are on the forefront of using DNA
sequencing for personalized medicine to
sequence every tumor and every infection
we like many other researchers are now
using the best of science to tackle the
worst of diseases and this is great this
is great that these devastating rare
childhood disorders are going to become
even more rare and it is great that
Senator John McCain&#39;s brain cancer will
get treated with cutting-edge science
and bleeding edge technology and it&#39;s
great that my own cancer survivor father
may now live long enough to see my
grandkids
but what about those in India and in
South Africa in Southeast Asia and
Brazil are pretty much everywhere that
isn&#39;t here
what are we gonna do drop a world-class
genomics lab into Nigeria or Laos or
Ecuador places where governments fail
and people don&#39;t have access to clean
water are plumbed bathrooms or high
school diplomas yes I get it those are
the reasons why we haven&#39;t done anything
like this for the last hundred years and
these reasons are all true but you know
what else is true things are changing
today in Nigeria ninety percent of
adults have a cell phone in Uganda over
40 percent used their cell phones to
conduct mobile banking the average
Malaysian has more access to information
and communication technology today than
President Bill Clinton did just 25 years
ago modern communication technology has
truly become democratized why not modern
medical technology and DNA sequencing
that&#39;s just digitizing DNA essentially
turning those a&#39;s g&#39;s t&#39;s and c&#39;s of the
DNA alphabet into ones and zeros turning
biology into information turning carbon
into silicon and silicon as we now know
has helped the developing world leapfrog
into the 21st century so why is DNA
sequencing so important well to know
what bacterias DNA is to know its
secrets to know where it comes from how
deadly it is and what drugs it&#39;s
resistant to unfortunately today in
Mumbai a doctor will order a drug
susceptibility test for her TB patient
and she will not get those results for
several weeks she can&#39;t wait that long
to find out how to treat her patient so
she pretty much just has to guess and
that is no way to beat back one of the
worst scourge ah&#39;s of all time and with
today&#39;s technology we can do this with a
tabletop sequencer
some easy-to-use lab supplies laptop
computer and a power source for a few
hours
heck I could do this in a Winnebago we
certainly can do it in a district lab in
Kampala or Karachi ARPA Phnom Penh and
we hope to be taking solutions like this
to places like these by this time next
year oh and one more thing what I&#39;m
holding here this is a fourth generation
DNA sequencer no kidding and it can plug
into an iPad and it can deliver sequence
data in as little as 15 minutes
practically by the bedside now it&#39;s not
quite the tricorder but it can be and
maybe it will be and then it should be
everywhere where there&#39;s a smartphone
which is just about everywhere so now
for my third thing why Tom Cruise can
help us solve tuberculosis and save the
world from tuberculosis now I&#39;m
obviously harkening back here to the
great movie thriller Minority Report and
this was where his character played a
detective in the pre-crime division a
great but scary concept that if we had
the ability to stop a crime before it
happens what length should the
government go to to make that a reality
should we lock up the pre criminals for
a crime they have yet to commit well
antibiotic resistance is the real crime
of tuberculosis and we are quickly
running out of options to treat the
infected not only are we seeing the rise
of MDR or multi drug-resistant TB and
XDR
extremely drug-resistant TB we are now
seeing pan resistance or complete
resistance to the available drugs which
essentially is putting us back into the
pre-antibiotic era where our only
response is to exclude these people from
the rest of society effectively locking
them up for a crime they never committed
but what if we were able to stop this
bacterial crime before it actually
happens
we may have found a way to do this you
see in clinical labs today we can detect
down to just about 5 resistant bacteria
out of a total of a hundred in a patient
sample but unfortunately if a patient&#39;s
infection is already 5% resistant it&#39;s
already too late the patient will
quickly become completely resistant and
will fail therapy but we have found a
way to hack the very DNA sequencing
technology I was talking about so that
we can identify the very first resistant
bacteria down to one in 10,000 we can
detect this genetic signal of impending
resistance many months sometimes up to a
year and a half before resistance
actually occurs before the patient fails
therapy giving the doctors enough time
to hopefully cure the patient this
minority report of a TB infection is
allowing us to get beyond Diagnostics
and move into the realm of prognostics
we are hopefully or at least envisioning
developing departments of pre resistance
for global TB control now this doesn&#39;t
mean that I fancy myself as some Tom
Cruise character but it does mean that
we may be able to stop these bacterial
crimes before they&#39;re ever committed and
so since we have the ability we have the
responsibility to move these first
world&#39;s solutions and to connect them to
our third world problems to give those
doctors on the front line actionable
information to beat back the worst
diseases and to give their patients a
fighting chance to not become one of
those statistics that we all hate thank
you
