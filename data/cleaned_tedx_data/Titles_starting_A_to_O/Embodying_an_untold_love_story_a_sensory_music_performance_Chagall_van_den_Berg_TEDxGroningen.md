good afternoon my name is sugar I&#39;m a
musician and performer music producer
and I play my music with the Mimi gloves
they let me control any effects on my
voice any electronic sound in my
computer and also the visual projections
behind me for example I could bring in a
choir with the role of my brace and I
want to move my left hand to the side I
bring in some sense
and the whiter my arms are apart the
more reverb there is
and I&#39;m bringing it back all together
all together all together all together
all together this is really exciting
technology and over the last few years
it really helped me to make my
electronic music performance is more
personal more intuitive more human so
this is how I make my music but this is
not why I make music why I love art how
it helps me to be a more better
functioning human being to understand
myself connect to others around me today
or in the past in a seventeenth-century
and Brad she wrote a love poem for her
deceased husband if ever two were one
then surely we if ever man was loved by
wife than thee if every wife was happy
in a man and compared me with her if you
can so hundreds of years later these
loving words got to me and I decided to
write a song based on them maybe because
I thought in the 17th century people who
were married didn&#39;t really fall in love
or maybe despite or because I&#39;m the
daughter of divorced parents I&#39;m just a
sucker for everlasting love for after 50
years of marriage love beyond the grave
love isn&#39;t it cool that after all of
these hundreds of years all of the
advances we&#39;ve seen in technology but
also in our landscape and politics we
are still touched and motivated by the
same thing so it&#39;s with this same
passion and driven by the same thing
that motivated everyone in the 17th
century that I make my music so I&#39;m
gonna play for you Shirley
