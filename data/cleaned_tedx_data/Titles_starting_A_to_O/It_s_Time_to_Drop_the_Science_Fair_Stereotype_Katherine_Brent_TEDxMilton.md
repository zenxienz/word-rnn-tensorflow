I&#39;d like to start off with a little bit
of a story I&#39;ve always been an
incredibly curious person I was the
person that wanted to take things apart
put them back together just to figure
out how they worked the way they did and
why they worked and I&#39;m really still
like that today so one day I think my
inquisitive nature led me to ask one of
my friends in sixth grade on the
playground the age-old question what
would you like to be when you grow up
now her response baffled me quite a bit
she told me that she wanted to be an
engineer now I knew I had heard that
word before but I couldn&#39;t quite place
where an engineer okay oh I know where
I&#39;ve heard that word a locomotive
engineer right okay I can get behind
that I love trains but that wasn&#39;t what
she meant at all in fact what she meant
in her case was that she wanted to be a
software engineer but to me the entire
realm of Professional Engineering was
completely unknown and let&#39;s
fast-forward to right now almost a
decade later and I&#39;m currently pursuing
a degree in engineering
now something must have happened in that
period of time where I not only figured
out what it was but I also figured out
that it was what I wanted to do for the
rest of my life and when I think back to
what that catalyst was that made me
really fall in love with the discipline
I realized that it was science fairs
when I tell you about science fairs you
may think of images of blue ribbons of
baking soda volcanoes and of other
stereotypical images of the like but I
can assure you that science fairs today
especially in Canada are not like that
these titles behind me look like they
may be able to be ripped right from an
academic dissertation but in reality
these are the titles of recent science
fair projects by elementary school and
high school individuals
it&#39;s easy to think that maybe I just
pulled out a few outliers here that
maybe these are just a few extraordinary
project in the sea of the mundane
projects but I just show you that these
happen all over Canada and the world
incredible steps and science are made by
youth everyday in Canada we have 102
regional science fairs they span every
single province and territory but
they&#39;re not super known although here
students can compete against their peers
in order to vie for a spot on the
regional and/or provincial teams for the
Kenda wide science fair the candle wide
science fair is Canada&#39;s largest youth
science event it brings together 400 to
500 of Canada&#39;s brightest young
innovators every May in order to share
their research with their peers as well
as people in the industry such as
doctors engineers and professors they
also get to compete which is really fun
for some enter provincial rivalries and
it&#39;s quite honestly one of the best
weeks for science students the step up
from that is the International Science
and Engineering Fair the International
Science and Engineering Fair sees
individuals not only cannot compete
against provinces and territories but
rather individuals represent their
country and compete against the entire
world kanda has historically done
extraordinarily well at the
International Science Engineering Fair
I&#39;m quite happy to report so especially
here is where you see those projects
that really do have the capacity to not
only change the industry of science
technology engineering and mathematics
known as stem but they also have the
capacity to have a lasting impact on
society and I don&#39;t say that lightly I&#39;d
like to introduce to you three
individuals who through their research
have been able to make an impact in
their field and send a ripple through
their academic discipline from a very
young age
the first is Jack Mogis Jack
participated in the candlelight Science
Fair three times and last year
participated in the International
Science and Engineering Fair he is a
health oriented materials researcher y
ou Li is a naturally occurring rubber
compound what Jack was able to do is he
was able to infuse the guai Li with
graphene which makes the very first nano
composite material that is antifungal
antibacterial electrically conductive
and has advanced mechanical properties
this is huge in fact he was able to
expand his research in order to create a
surgical glove that can be used in the
industry that because of its properties
is puncture-proof and he bacterial and
can be sterilized and reused multiple
times so as to cut back on medical waste
the next individual is some disease and
she like me caught the engineering bug
through science fair her focus is also
on health materials but it&#39;s more on the
bio interfacing level she participated
in the candle wide science fair in 2015
and the International Science
Engineering Fair in 2016 she&#39;s had two
incredible projects over those two years
and they both focused on bio interfacing
materials one of which was a bio inert
textured coating that can go on to
implants to make them more compatible
with the bone so that they are more
effective in connecting with the bone
but when somebody does have a bone
implant another one saw her create a
calcium phosphate cement that is able to
be used when in a surgery or in an
implant where a bone cement would be
used however it fully bio integrates as
the bone grows back it eats away the
cement so that when you&#39;re all healed
you don&#39;t have that foreign matter in
you anymore so it&#39;s completely
biocompatible
perhaps one of the most prolific youth
scientists in the science fair industry
today is Catherine Bowman Catherine
parts has fade in the candle wide
science fair for three years and the
International Science Engineering Fair
for two she works in the lymphedema
treatment lymphedema is a chronic
inflammatory disease that affects
approximately 100 million people
globally now despite this large number
of people affected there&#39;s currently no
pharmacological treatment instead people
that have the disorder or disease rather
are subjected to multiple rounds of
physically exertive tiring tedious
therapy in order to physically try and
move the liquid that&#39;s president
lymphedema off the tissues Catherine
decided it was time for a
pharmacological treatment and she is
currently having a great amount of
success with naturally occurring
compounds to treat lymphedema she&#39;s
currently studying health sciences and
has been able to speak across the
country in multiple provinces about
lymphedema and is a well-respected peer
in that field in fact she sits on the
Alberta land f√°tima Association Board
of Directors and she got that position
when she was just 18 I think it&#39;s
important to note that although these
people have some incredible inventions
now they didn&#39;t wake up one day thinking
I&#39;m going to make a nano composite
material or I&#39;m going to figure out some
bio interfacing cements or even I&#39;m
going to find pharmacological treatment
for lymphedema in fact they had very
humble beginnings jock started with a
project in liquefaction Sam his first
project was on color attention or memory
detention using color coding and
Catherine looked at bacteria in reusable
bags however through the outlet of
science fair they were able to build
their way up to projects that have
meaningful and lasting impacts not only
on the academic industry but on society
I think what it really comes down to
for me is four main points about the
importance of science fairs and the
effect on their they have on youth for
one science fairs are able to bring
sideline groups into the conversation
often people and groups such as females
indigenous peoples and people from
developing country aren&#39;t able to
participate in academia and especially
not stem now this is completely unfair
because these people have amazing ideas
and they have every right to be in that
industry so science fairs provide that
outlet for these people who may be
marginalized or sidelined in the
conversation to become a part of the
narrative
additionally science fairs enrich
scientific experience through cultural
dialogue and travel
I personally was able to travel to
Australia to be part of the National
Youth Science Forum on behalf of Canada
in 2015
being able to talk to people with
diverse cultural backgrounds diverse
academic backgrounds and diverse
interests for me was absolutely
incredible and to do it all while
bounding bonding over science was a real
treat people from Canada get to be get
to go to places like Taiwan and Norway
and Belgium for scientific initiatives
representing Canada and in a world that
is hallmarked by its divisive Ness I
think it&#39;s incredibly important for
people to start that international
conversation and to do so well making
projects and coming up with ideas that
can help not only one area but how does
potential to affect people
internationally in a positive way I
think it really is important to bring
people from different nations into the
conversation also science fairs
introduced academic practices an inquiry
early oftentimes when people get to
post-secondary education they&#39;re pretty
lost posters and reports and abstracts
are all foreign and it takes a while to
get used to which is especially hard to
do when you&#39;re undergoing academic rigor
studying no science for kids have a bit
of a step up
after doing it quite a bit poster boards
and reports and abstracts become far
easier so people are able to right away
dive into their research and be on more
of a level with some of their academic
peers I think one of the most important
things about science fair though would
be the camaraderie these photos are all
from the Canada wide science fair and
the four weeks I was able to spend over
four years of Canada wide science fair
absolutely changed my life I now have
friends from coast to coast and I&#39;ve
learned things that I never thought I
would be able to learn and I&#39;ve been
inspired to continue my innovations
through other people bouncing ideas off
each other and also just having a lot of
fun so when I really think back to that
one day in grade six on the playground
what I asked my friend what do you want
to be when you grow up I don&#39;t think I
asked the right question I think I
should have just asked her what do you
want to be what are your passions what
kind of legacy do you want to leave on
this world because the truth is you
don&#39;t have to wait till they grow up to
make an impact on the industry has
positive societal effects in fact they
can start right now people always say
that youth are tomorrow they are they
hold the future but I&#39;m here to tell you
that youth can be invested and are
invested in science technology
engineering and mathematics today and
through science fairs they get that
outlet to be able to be part of that
industry and to make real changes right
away thank you
[Applause]
you
