my grandfather used to tell me a lot of
choice starting from his traveling
stories and life lessons and some boring
stories that contained a lot about the
topic that I&#39;m going to talk about
tonight
so I decided the topic that impacted
most without his that&#39;s all boring life
lesson stories which was being the owner
of yourselves and tonight that&#39;s gonna
be our topic no three O&#39;s my
grandfather&#39;s to take me speeches more
than stories because it was really all
and then one night he told me about this
being the owner of ourselves starting
from small things all seven I didn&#39;t
really know what that meant but I still
kept it in my mind thought it was
important and then I started to do a
little things by doing my chores and
then cleaning up and keeping tick away
but I&#39;m supposed to study I start by
small things and then my grandfather
started to talk more about this topic
like this he gave me a really long
speech and then I was still young I was
eight years old or nine years old and
then I noticed that I learned a few
things but it was kind of off topic that
human being could sleep while eating at
the same time and then while we were
moving
we had a new house so we were moving our
bookshops was organized and then I was
moving my small bookshelf that I really
liked and then this random book just
fell out of the sky fry a bookshelf
though so it&#39;s called it&#39;s super nerdy
don&#39;t worry
it&#39;s called study is the respect of my
life so it sounds super nerdy but the
study here I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mainly
about the actual study math science
English it&#39;s mostly about the life
studying so it really impacted me and
that I had the same contents that my
grandfather&#39;s to tell me which also kind
of make me bored out and all the nanites
again but it also impacted me a lot
because I found that it was really funny
that it also matched my grandfather
story and I really liked the story
itself too it contains about stories
about starting from small chores or like
small things like like putting your tech
boy or YouTube away and also having time
management you because when you do this
sometimes you do something else while
doing this like for example when you&#39;re
in study hall you can watch u2 and like
the article at the same time that&#39;s not
being the owner of yourself
the book says that if you want to be an
actual owner herself has to do one thing
at the same time so I got motivated by
this book and I started to write my book
which title is normal life I know the
title is super normal because it&#39;s
normal life so it contains a story about
the same thing that the other book also
contains but an easier version it has my
life story kinda and my grandfather
story and also contains contains the
book the motivation so this also hasn&#39;t
but the it also is the meaning of that
book but the main reason why I named it
normal life is because many people can
take different paths is like someone
give me a doctor&#39;s or I can be an actor
somebody who can become I don&#39;t know so
it&#39;s a normal life you can feel like
it&#39;s a normal life even though you&#39;re
starring you might be it&#39;s normal I
don&#39;t care but I thought about this and
almost normal life without the question
mark until I finished the book after I
finished the book I added a question
mark there because I thought that it&#39;s
not a normal life like and actually
because there&#39;s no definition that
divides normal life and special life and
you don&#39;t know which life is a special
life because your life okay you might
feel it it&#39;s normal but it might be
special life from some people so I felt
like this and I wrote this book with all
my motivations and I really enjoyed it
and I started to make little changes in
myself too so I used to okay I&#39;ll tell
you this my adviser sorry I used to
watch to YouTube and study Oh sometimes
yeah I know it&#39;s funny and I&#39;m not
supposed to do that
and yeah I did it I got caught by mr.
face sometimes
and then after writing this book I kind
of started to make a change writing for
the TEDx and writing for my book I start
to make little changes to get away from
YouTube and then actually studying was
supposed to study and then actually to
write like my story man I&#39;m supposed to
do it so I had better time management
which was also in the before story so I
think like starting from the small
things it&#39;s more important than doing
like big things like doing something
to the society or something like I think
it&#39;s really important to do something
small and start from small things
because that might be a big it might
develop to a big thing so good luck and
be a good owner of herself thank you
