I&#39;d like to start today by introducing
you to two young people I met recently
two incredible young people who&#39;ve
risked their lives fighting injustice
and fighting for freedom on the left you
have aya she&#39;s from Tunisia and on the
right you have limine he&#39;s from The
Gambia both were active participants in
peaceful revolutions in their country
fighting to overcome dictatorship
fighting to overcome corrupt governments
and when we met we were talking about
the issue of inequality and what they
were very passionate about was that
changing government for them was just
the beginning they really wanted to
build a fairer better world and it&#39;s
that inspiration that I want to try and
talk about a bit today have no doubt we
are facing an inequality crisis we&#39;re
seeing levels of extreme wealth that
we&#39;ve never seen before eight people not
just people eight men owning the same
wealth as the bottom 3.6 billion people
when Oxfam started making these
calculations it was about three hundred
and fifty billionaires about four years
ago we had a picture of an aeroplane
then it was sixty two billionaires we
had a London bus and then this year it&#39;s
eight and we&#39;re thinking how small can
it get how unequal can our world become
and the facts are very serious if you
look at the poorest countries and the
richest countries the majority of them
are seeing the gap between the richest
and the rest of us increase rapidly in
rich nations it used to be the received
economic wisdom that as your country
became richer inequality fell and you
became a more equal society but
something happened in the late 1970s to
turn that around and now in the majority
of rich countries inequality has been
rising remorselessly now why should we
care about this why is it important that
we&#39;ve got more rich people with more
money than ever before there are a
number of reasons
oxfam we care passionately about ending
poverty and you just will not be able to
end poverty in the world unless you
tackle this gap between rich and poor
let me give you an example in Nigeria
they had seven percent economic growth
every year for a decade in the 2000s and
yet who got the most of that growth you
can see from this graph the vast
majority in fact that almost all of the
economic growth during that period went
to the top 10% in Nigerian society in a
country where 10 million children still
don&#39;t get to go to school and many many
children die before the age of 5
economic growth was strong poverty
increased and the number of millionaires
almost doubled so it&#39;s incredibly
important that we look at inequality -
and not just economic growth but there
are many other reasons why inequality is
really important I come from England I
come from the UK I grew up in in the
south I went to a government school and
on my way to school I used to cycle pass
one of the most expensive private
schools in the country and I was young I
didn&#39;t think it made any difference I
didn&#39;t really know these people I
remember thinking that they had a nice
cricket pitch and it was quite a
nice-looking school but it never really
occurred to me that this was a big issue
until I went to university and I
discovered that the majority of the
people at university with me had gone to
a private school and when you look at
the numbers 7 percent of British
children go to a private school just 7
percent yet 50 percent of our
journalists went to private school 70%
of our judges went to private school and
this perhaps the saddest thing of all
more than half of our rock bands went to
private school even Coldplay went to
private school so the working-class
bands of the past the clash the jam even
the Beatles forget about it unless you
went to private school you can&#39;t get
famous these days
why is this so important because it&#39;s
about social mobility we all know about
the American dream the idea that if you
were talented you&#39;ve got hard work
you&#39;ve got something to give society
that you can progress well the American
Dream has become an American Nightmare
if you&#39;re born poor
you will die poor particular in the u.s.
but all over the world the idea that you
can have mobility through societies
getting harder and harder and that&#39;s a
really bad thing for Humanity if you
think of all the challenges we face if
we face climate change we face huge
health problems we need our best most
talented people and I&#39;ve lived and
worked in in schools in Africa and you
see particularly girls dropping out of
school at the age of seven or eight
having hardly learned anything it just
makes you one to think of the
squandering of talent think of the the
rocket scientists the teachers the
engineers that as we speak are unable to
go to school anymore
they may be working in the fields will
never benefit from that talent so it&#39;s
incredibly important the other big
problem with inequality is if you&#39;re
rich if you just buy a yacht or you buy
a really nice car it doesn&#39;t matter that
much but when you start buying politics
when you start buying the media when you
start buying impunity from justice which
we see all over the world and not just
in the poor world you just have to look
at Donald Trump&#39;s cabinet to see that
the problem of billionaires empowering
purchasing power is a serious issue all
over the world
this man Franklin Roosevelt was
President of the United States just
after the Great Depression when it was
perceived that organized money had
really taken control of American society
there was a need to fight back and I
think that&#39;s just as true now as it was
then that extreme wealth breeds capture
of politics capture of our economies so
we have an economy that works for the 1%
instead of the rest of us some might say
inequality is inevitable it&#39;s like the
rain or the weather there&#39;s nothing we
can do about it
when people say that I&#39;d like to show
them this picture Equatorial Guinea
small country in Africa is actually a
high-income country it&#39;s a got a per
capita average income higher than
Portugal higher than Spain but it has an
infant mortality rate higher than Haiti
so it has incredible inequality and
these cars belonged to the son of the
president of Equatorial Guinea and there
were some I&#39;m not expert on cars but
some Maseratis mercedes-benz they were
seized from him in a in a lawsuit that
was brought against him in that in the
United States for crimes against the
people of Equatorial Guinea they also
seized his estate in Malibu and they he
apparently owned the white glove that
was Michael Jackson&#39;s at one point they
seized that to the point of the story is
that even in the most corrupt difficult
place on earth as an ability to fight
back that money was then given back to
the people of Equatorial Guinea and in
Latin America we&#39;ve seen real positive
trend in the last 10 to 15 years
countries all over that continent
bucking the global trend going the
different direction and reducing
inequality that gap between rich and
poor is getting smaller so it&#39;s not the
case that this is inevitable when
countries make the right choices we can
close that gap with all the benefits
that it brings and one of the four main
ingredients of reducing inequality
warren buffett is the second richest man
on earth every year he goes through an
exercise where he calculates his
percentage rate of tax how much he&#39;s
paying and how much percent he&#39;s paying
and he compares that to the what&#39;s paid
by his secretary and every year for the
last ten years he&#39;s paid a lower rate of
tax than his secretary we&#39;re living in
an upside-down world where the richest
people no longer pay any tax the richest
corporations no longer pay hardly any
tax is ordinary people
that of paying the taxation so we&#39;re
seeing a kind of upwards vacuum of
wealth and money going out to the top so
one of the things that has to be fixed
is the tax system we have to have the
richest people the richest corporations
paying their fair share education is
crucial public services like health
that&#39;s what we saw in Latin America
you&#39;ve seen a big investment in the
kinds of services that poor people need
for all the reasons that are outlined
about social mobility but also the huge
cost to poor people when you don&#39;t have
free health care when you live in fear
of getting sick because you can&#39;t afford
to see the doctor investment in those
kinds of things can transform inequality
and then finally wages we&#39;ve seen wages
stagnate from many many ordinary people
across the world across Europe and in
many other parts of the world whereas
wages at the top are shooting up so
things you can do to increase the
minimum wage is what they did in Brazil
to try and close that gap but finally
what&#39;s the fourth ingredient and I think
this is the most important one I&#39;ve been
involved in a lot of campaigns in my
life and been fortunate enough to work
with a number of incredible people and
we&#39;re very much standing on the
shoulders of giants standing on the
incredible campaigns from the past that
brought us votes for women that brought
an end to slavery and into apartheid
every single time you&#39;ve seen
progressive change in history it&#39;s been
through people power it&#39;s been through
the power of community the power of
ordinary people to speak up and to make
sure that their leaders are working for
them and not for the 1% so I think
people power is absolutely crucial in
this story and if we&#39;re going to combat
the inequality crisis if we want to
imagine a better world a fairer world
then we really need to come together
more than ever to try and close that gap
to fight for a fairer world and an
alliance is forming across the world to
do that this picture is from the
Philippines where I was recently they&#39;ve
just the terrible dictator elected
is carrying out many killings in the
country they are again on the streets
risking their lives fighting for a
fairer society fighting for a better
world which I think we can all imagine
and I think we all believe we could have
and we must have so I think it&#39;s
incredibly important to understand that
yes we know what needs to be done we
need to tax the rich we need to spend
that on services that benefit the whole
community we need to pay people a living
wage these are not rocket science we
know they work but more than anything we
and I mean you I mean me we need to
fight for these things because otherwise
we won&#39;t get them we are the people that
we&#39;ve been waiting for
[Applause]
