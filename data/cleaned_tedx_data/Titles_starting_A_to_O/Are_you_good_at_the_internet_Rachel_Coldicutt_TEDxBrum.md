right I&#39;m beginning by asking everyone
here to do the job so if you think
you&#39;re good at the Internet put your
hand up put you hand up okay so what we
got I&#39;m gonna say maybe two thirds you
say mm everyone here thinks I&#39;m good at
the Internet and I run a think-tank got
everyone and we&#39;re fighting before a
ferret internet and there&#39;s a part of
that over the last year we&#39;ve asked lots
of the people to tell us if they think
they aren&#39;t good at the internet and we
asked and then to write themselves out
of 10 and people are very confident so
only a tiny number of people are under a
provide nearly a quarter of the 10 out
of 10 all right that&#39;s pretty pretty
good however when we started to delve
into that and we asked people if they
understood how and tracking what if they
felt safe if they knew how that phone
was interpreting information about them
their general level of the confidence
started to go down and this is partly
because I&#39;m afraid people would like me
have spent the last 20 years we&#39;re
making everything really easy to do
right everything is really really easy
to do which means you don&#39;t have to
think about it I don&#39;t know if you know
made a purchase on Amazon and done and
done one-click or if you had Jeannie now
on your phone and you started to notice
there&#39;s kind of crazy thing
of the auto response which is
interesting because on the one hand that
is great because everyone hating mail
nobody is really interesting you know I
think more but on the other hand it
means that you no longer really have to
talk to your friends or lover or mother
because guess what but the Internet is
able to do it on your behalf and this is
both good and bad and it comes partly as
a part of years and years and years of
trying to make everything easier to use
this book here it was kind of in the
late 90s early 2000s but the thing that
everybody read and it explained as you
get people from A to B as quickly and
easily as possible and this is such an
in Grain thought that it&#39;s even one of
the government design principles it&#39;s
something like make it simple it makes
it better but the problem is it doesn&#39;t
help us to understand everyone is really
confident but nobody really understands
and that I think I&#39;d argue that making
it understandable is is the thing that
makes it better as opposed to and this
is a problem because we go through life
now making choices based on the things
that feel okay these kinds of
experiences that go on ain&#39;t a single
click they activate something in a brain
school called pre attended printer
settings which means you don&#39;t really
have to think or understand it hits and
it happens really quickly and this is an
issue in all kinds of areas we&#39;ll say
this here is something that that was on
Twitter last week on the left is the log
into iTunes that anyone who has meant
the phone has hopefully had probably
hundreds of times on the right is a
phishing scam and the two you look
totally the same and it isn&#39;t only about
the things that I have to go vertically
them we don&#39;t understand there&#39;s
actually lots of things happening more
intimately I delved into the location
data on my phone
this is everywhere I&#39;ve been in London
in the last two months it even knows if
I&#39;ve been to the supermarket and how
long like a bit of that and the the
times I come home and leave again and
this kind of granular data is the thing
that that empowers most of the big
internet businesses it either allows a
service to be to be targeted at you or
it allows ads to be sold to you and this
is sort of amazing on an individual
level but it becomes truly overwhelming
if you think about the scale of it so
there&#39;s an interview in The Guardian
last week with the CEO of Google he said
they are on track to have five billion
users the facebook now has two billion
making it larger than any country in the
world
but unlike countries we aren&#39;t able to
vote on Rebell right and that has all
kinds of impacts for us as individuals
and as as as as a whole and it&#39;s coming
out particularly in in terms of news and
democracy so this here is a fake
the site it makes the $40,000 the month
from making things up and then looks
pretty much exactly the same as the New
York Post which means that you know and
it gets picked up on google or
syndicated the face book book it&#39;s kind
of hard to tell
golly I&#39;m true I&#39;m not and this is
becoming even more pressing because it
means that a lot of us are making
choices that are based on implementing
position that we&#39;re not able to really
understand the the original said the
face but just announced that they were
aware that a hundred thousand pounds had
been spent on Russia in the run-up to
the election last year targeting between
the states and so and there&#39;s it&#39;s
estimated that three hundred and eighty
million people have been exposed to
those ants and this becomes really scary
when the most powerful man in the world
cannot tell the difference between what
is really happening and not right and
you&#39;re laughing but it is not a joking
matter because he&#39;s absorbed all of this
convenience easiness to the point that
if he is interested in talking about war
he doesn&#39;t have to go through the usual
channels it can happen or Twitter and
all of that may seem as if it&#39;s
happening a million miles away but it&#39;s
nearer to us
I think they weren&#39;t really aware anyone
who&#39;s been living in Britain in the last
two years it&#39;s really aware of the kind
of strange political and miasma and each
and every one of us has been targeted in
some way
and it&#39;s harder and harder to make
your rent mind and understand what&#39;s
happening so is there an alternative I
hope so and I&#39;ll talk very quickly about
four things we&#39;re trying i thought
everyone so that first is thinking about
like the internet is currently kind of
from lawless how about if we introduced
a code of conduct sort of like either a
geneva can can venture north on a
highway code or a Hippocratic oath kind
of rules of the road that everybody
understands and we&#39;re starting to bring
people together to help formulate man
think about it we&#39;re also experimenting
with prototypes to help people start to
introduce a bit of friction and thought
back into those into those and those
experiences
we&#39;re so here the point is you&#39;re able
to see is there a dating service or a
streaming app that better meets your own
values and then longer time rather than
moving in bananas as it&#39;s saying we&#39;re
thinking about the fare trend so if
technology is hard to understand can we
start to introduce kind of meaningful
the tools and the length of balls that
help people know more about the
provenance of the things they&#39;re using
and I think most interestingly and I
hope you&#39;ll start to hear more about
this next year we&#39;re launching a big
public information public information
campaign because all of us have the
right to understand and we think that
that&#39;s the beginning of changing it so
to go back to the beginning
put your hand up now if you think you&#39;re
good at the internet it&#39;s like less I
think this was like more like a quarter
but that&#39;s okay that&#39;s okay because we
all have an opportunity if you read that
slide you&#39;d have a real opportunity but
it&#39;s one thing because I think I believe
that the best way is doing invented to
predict the future is to in prevent it
and we all have the chance to do that
together
thank you very much
