so my theme is memory and forgetting and
let me begin with a little story we live
in Edinburgh in Scotland in the north of
the country and I had to go some years
ago on a business trip down to London in
the middle of winter so I flew down and
I got on the train got close to London
got on the Metro and was headed for my
destination and it was very warm on the
Metro incredibly hot so I took off my
winter coat and read the newspaper and
when I got to Oxford Circus on the Metro
I got off the train to go to my meeting
and realised just as the train was
pulling out of the station that I&#39;d left
my coat on the train so I rushed up to
the station staff and I explained what
had happened and I asked them would they
ring forward and ask a colleague if they
could tree see if they could find my my
coat so I waited and waited a while and
then the man came up to me and said
we&#39;ve found your coat a very kind member
of the public has handed it in and if
you get back on the train and go to such
and such a station you can get your coat
again so that was great so I got on the
train and I went to this station and I
went up to the office and just as I was
about to get my coat I realised that I&#39;d
left my briefcase back in Oxford Circus
so I had to explain to the station staff
would they phone back to the staff in
Oxford Circus and see if they could find
my briefcase
I heard the man say tenemos una Maria
Loco
in broad London slag you appreciate so I
went back to Oxford Circus gripping my
coat tightly and I got there and I was
finally reunited not only with my coat
but my briefcase
now the story actually goes on with even
more embarrassment but I think that&#39;s
enough for today to explain that
forgetting happens to us all
it&#39;s what my mum and dad would have
called a fact of life and it&#39;s annoying
isn&#39;t it when we forget something and it
seems to get in the way but what I want
to put to you today is that forgetting
is a perfectly normal part of memory in
fact it&#39;s a necessary part of memory and
I will try to explain this in terms of
the way the brain forms memories and the
processes that are involved now we make
memories all the time and there are
situations such as at school where the
process of committing something to
memory is a very deliberate process
intentional we&#39;re trying hard to say
learn English or in my case espanol and
you really have to make an effort but
most of the time the process of memory
happens just automatically you can&#39;t
stop it
whatever you attend to you form some
representation not necessarily
completely accurate but some
representation in what&#39;s had happened to
you
so I think I could probably ask anybody
in this room what you had for breakfast
today
and you&#39;d be able to tell me and so
there&#39;s this sense in which memory is
happening completely automatically now
the brain is clearly involved it has a
number of different memory systems and
as you know it has thousands and
millions of cells and these cells have
many connections so what might be
actually happening when we form a memory
well deep within the brain there&#39;s a
structure called the hippocampus
it&#39;s just inside here in the medial
temporal lobe on both sides of the brain
at least in most people and this area of
the brain is critical for actually
forming the connections that enable you
to make a lasting memory and the reason
it&#39;s critical is because information
comes into your visual system at the
back or your auditory system the smell
and passes from these sensory systems
through various perceptual systems and
down to this single area of the brain
which is able to somehow connect all
this information together and it through
an automatic process makes those
connections now the person who first
suggested that changing the connections
in the brain was critical for memory was
Santiago Rommel iike and he did so in
his book first published in Spanish
later in French in 1910 and in a very
famous lecture given at the Royal
Society in 1894 and he spoke about
mental gymnastics changing the strength
of connections between neurons in the
brain and what he did through
painstaking work was to draw the cells
that he found in lots of different areas
of the brain in lots of different
animals and this is one of his most
famous drawings which is here in the
Kahala Institute in Madrid this is
actually his drawing of the hippocampus
which I&#39;ve just been talking about it&#39;s
a beautiful structure in its
three-dimensional appearance as you&#39;ve
seen but its intrinsic structure has
this beautiful connectivity which
somehow enables information from these
various different areas to come together
and we are in the process of trying to
understand exactly what mechanism is
involved in making that happen and one
discovery was that indeed the
connections can be changed in strength
as shown in physiological experiments
we&#39;re beginning to understand some of
the pharmacology and biochemistry and I
over about 10 to 15 years with my team
in Edinburgh tried to do a number of
animal experiments to rigorously test
the idea that changing the strength of
connections really was in
volved in memory and the gist of it is
that a particular transmitter in the
brain called glutamate binds to a
particular receptor just like a key
going into a lock and when that happens
it triggers biochemical changes which
increase the strength of these
connections and in that way make
connections between different types of
sensory information now you may be
wondering if this automatic processing
is going all all the time isn&#39;t there a
risk that the system would become
completely saturated you&#39;re making
memories every second every minute every
hour through the day couldn&#39;t the system
then get completely filled up well that
is what happens you know at the end of
the day after a busy day your brain is
completely full you&#39;re you can&#39;t take it
anymore right
you&#39;ve got too much information in there
well this is where in keeping with the
theme of subtract forgetting comes to
the rescue because it turns out that
this process of synaptic potentiation
happens very suddenly when events happen
but then the synapse is gradually over
time a few hours and at most a day or
two move back down to the lower level of
strength that they had at the beginning
so what does that buy for you I&#39;m sure
you&#39;re all aware that evolution is very
clever and it works out somehow how the
best way to do things well what this
buys for you is that you&#39;re capturing
all this information and then you got as
it were some period of time for your
brain to as it were work out what&#39;s
worth keeping and what&#39;s not worth
keeping and let the boring
inconsequential stuff fade away so if I
were to ask any of you what you had for
breakfast exactly a month ago on August
the 2nd 2017
unless you have exactly the same thing
for breakfast every day I suspect most
of you can&#39;t remember unless you are on
holiday and sitting in a cafe and
Formentera and the next table had some
famous film stars or something like that
then maybe you could but this
information fades away now
evolution has a further trick up its
sleeve and that is that during this
period of time of forgetting other
things may be happening which as it were
shed light on the information you&#39;ve
just been processing they may turn a
parent into inconsequential information
into something of some significance and
this happens in situations of great
novelty or surprise or particularly when
rather terrifying things happen so if I
ask anybody in this room what was
happening to you on the 11th of March
2004 you will of course remember on fear
me that was the day of the tragic
bombings in the thick aeneas trains
between arkla and Natasha not so far
from here and it was a terrible tragedy
it may well have affected one or two of
the families of the people here in the
room but when we think back to that of
course there&#39;s the devastating images in
our mind of the wrecked trains that you
saw on the news and in the papers but I
suspect for many of you you also
remember many of the trivial events of
that day perhaps what you had for
breakfast who you&#39;re with where you were
who you are talking with and so on
because it appears as though in
situations where novelty you&#39;re
surprised happens particularly something
that&#39;s kind of terrifying there&#39;s an
upregulation of the arousal system and
then a kind of print now of capturing
everything and arresting this forgetting
process such that you
everything because after all if
something very surprising happens then
even the most innocuous things may
really matter so you might as well keep
everything now I became very interested
in this phenomenon and decided it would
be interesting to try to do some animal
experiments on it with a view to trying
to understand the underlying
biochemistry of what actually might be
going on so we set up some experiments
in which rats and mice were taught tasks
which they forgot within a day you&#39;d
learn something then they&#39;d forget it
they&#39;d learn something then they&#39;d
forget it
so that provided us a kind of platform
in which we could then every so often
investigate the impact of novelty and we
devised a way of giving of somewhat
innocuous novel experience to an animal
by putting him into the square box which
was had a floor with either carpet or
tea or you know rice or something like
that and of course the animals are very
sensitive to these surfaces and they
found it a novel experience and when we
did that then it turned out that the
animals remembered for very much longer
the question we wanted to go on to ask
was exactly what cells in the brain and
what biochemical mechanism may be
responsible and so we turned to an
amazing new technique called opto
genetics in opto genetics we combined
the power of light with the power of
genetics in a single tool that was
developed at Stanford University in Palo
Alto in California and the idea is as
follows that you in a surgical operation
implant a virus into a particular area
of the brain that you think might be
responsible for this novelty effect and
what you implant is something called
channelrhodopsin inside the virus and
channelrhodopsin has the clever property
that when it&#39;s expressed inside these
cells because of the viral
administration then if you direct blue
light through a little light guide as
you can see in the picture down
precisely onto those cells in the brain
they will activate
and we discovered that there&#39;s a group
of cells called the locus coeruleus
which is heavily involved in arousal and
activation which also project to the
hippocampus and which appear to provide
this kind of print now signal and so
instead of giving the animals novelty we
would teach them something they were on
the process of forgetting it all and
then we&#39;d far up the blue light and lo
and behold they remembered it for very
much longer
so that was an experiment showing both
sufficiency that novelty produce the
activity of the cells and necessity
namely that the activity of those cells
was essential for the process that we
were observing so my message to you
today has been that when we make
memories there&#39;s this instantaneous
mechanism of synaptic potentiation that
makes synapses stronger because it&#39;s
connecting different bits of information
together but the system doesn&#39;t become
saturated because there&#39;s this
forgetting process this decline of
synaptic efficacy over a period of hours
or days and if that didn&#39;t happen we&#39;d
be in serious trouble and so what&#39;s
critical also to the hippocampus doing
its job is indeed forgetting because it
clears as it were the desktop of your
mind so that you&#39;re ready the next day
to take in new information so forgetting
is very important so to finish I&#39;d like
to speak to all of the partners in this
room the husbands and wives boyfriends
and girlfriends you perhaps been in
situations where your partner has
complained that you&#39;ve forgotten to do
something you&#39;ve forgotten to take out
the rubbish la basura you&#39;ve forgotten
to give the cat his milk
you&#39;ve forgotten to pick up the kids
from football well just remember that a
memory scientist told you what to say
s muy facil kyrenia discúlpame poor
Obeidallah
pero s normal
