so my radical idea is that we need to be
engaging teenagers in all the decisions
in their schools in the programs that
they participate in and in the
communities in which they live and I
came to this radical idea from a
transformative experience I had as a
teenager I was born in a working-class
family in Aurora Colorado my dad our
sole caregiver told us to keep our head
down work hard and generally we didn&#39;t
ruffle any feathers needless to say I
was never in the principal&#39;s office at
fifteen my mom passed away she died from
a mix of heavy cigarette use anorexia
nervosa and bipolar disorder she was a
danger to all in her path and she lived
her life in and out of psychiatric
hospitals in Dale&#39;s loss so at 16 my
counselor Judy Hyneman she called me
into her office one day and I thought oh
no am I in trouble but I wasn&#39;t she
invited me to write a grant a grant that
was for the get real program Colorado&#39;s
youth movement against the tobacco
industry I wrote and received my first
public health grant at 17 and the giro
program believed that you didn&#39;t have to
be 18 or 21 or 35 to make a difference
the gabrielle program believe that you
can make a difference right now they
taught me the power of my voice I healed
from wounds that I didn&#39;t even know that
I had and I was involved in the get real
program for 10 years as a teenager as a
college age trainer and then as a staff
person and I helped teens all across the
state from Yuma to Lake City Pass local
laws I&#39;m going to repeat that I have
teenagers pass laws to support Kalakaua
ladies are all that so unfortunately in
2010 as a result of the fiscal crisis
the get real program ended I had learned
to ruffled some feathers i alert i we
did sit in and yet the program closed
his doors this is a loss I felt deep
into my soul but I realized that the
power of the get real program it wasn&#39;t
in the t-shirt or the conferences but
the power of the get real program it was
inside of me and so with that I&#39;ve been
crazy passionate a really stalwart
advocate for ensuring that young people
get to learn the power of their voice
but there&#39;s a problem with this idea and
the problem unfortunately is so many of
you it&#39;s adults because adults
consciously or unconsciously for having
young people from participating fully as
full citizens in their lives the
systemic subordination of young people
as a targeted group who have little
access to power and are not allowed to
participate in civic life is called
adult ism adults is improving our laws
and our policies as perpetuated by the
media what you might be thinking right
now is oh no not you not me Heather I&#39;m
chill I&#39;m good I&#39;m kind young people or
perhaps you&#39;re thinking she totally made
this up but I did I promise
many people have talked about it dolt
ISM I&#39;m gonna ask you to check yourself
and answer some of the following
questions have you ever said any of the
following
you won&#39;t understand till you&#39;re older
I&#39;ve been doing this longer than you&#39;ve
been alive which was a quote said to a
teen I worked with Wow Cecelia you&#39;re so
articulate or smart or strong for your
age or have you ever said any it or
thought any of the following teens
they&#39;re so lazy well
blew something or all they care about is
their smartphones and snapchat as if
adults don&#39;t like their smartphones so
the media is replete with negative
depictions of teenagers and it&#39;s
unfortunate because adults who don&#39;t
have teenagers in their lives rely on
media&#39;s interpretation of teenagers and
adults make laws in our country and so
if you google teenager and meme that&#39;s
what you&#39;ll find this is just a small
sampling and so adults who don&#39;t have
teens in their lives rely on these
images to make their beliefs about
teenagers and young people are also
prohibited from meaningful roles in
civic life young people by conservative
estimate pay about 5% of our sales tax
they&#39;re pretty good consumers and that&#39;s
millions of dollars of both state and
federal sales tax each year and yet
young people they cannot vote and they
cannot run for elected office so
effectively they are taxed without
representation
which is something we fought for in the
American Revolution right all right and
unfortunately young people they
internalize this oppression and it makes
them feel powerless
it makes them doubt their own abilities
and it can even lead to depression so
perhaps what you&#39;re thinking right now
is but wait a second Heather there&#39;s
brain science young people&#39;s brains
they&#39;re under development right but I
will argue that brain science and brain
size and shape have long been used as a
tool for oppression it wasn&#39;t that long
ago that it was argued that women&#39;s
brains were smaller and that&#39;s why they
shouldn&#39;t vote or perhaps that
african-americans brains were smaller in
it that justified a lot of her horrific
acts before the civil rights
so while I&#39;m not going to argue brain
science with you today I will say that
brain science has always been used as a
tool to other people and I would
actually argue that teenagers brains are
uniquely developed there is no other
time than during adolescence that we
have the amazing capacity to challenge
the status quo young people have a
significant amount of emotional
intensity which can be channeled for
amazing things they&#39;re creative so
creative and they really strive to be
engaged in their communities so we have
a huge pool of untapped talent I think
we need to tap into them and I hope
you&#39;re thinking that right now too
because I have some things that you can
do to disrupt adult ism and your
everyday life the first thing that you
can do to disrupt adult ism is to check
in with yourself what are some of your
negative beliefs about teenagers if you
saw a teenager sitting on a park bench
what&#39;s your go-to reaction one thing
that you can do is something called the
mirror test the mirror test developed by
John Bell says when I treat an adult
this way or would I say these words to
someone I really valued and respected
the second thing that you can do is
listen and be curious about young people
and their lives I promise they&#39;re gonna
surprise you so we&#39;re going to use a
youth program in Denver&#39;s public housing
neighborhoods and last December we were
asking the teenagers if you could change
anything about this world what would you
change and why we went around the room
and Franco who was sitting in the back
of the classroom leaning against the
bookshelf armed his pockets hoodie all
the way up around his face seemingly
disengaged says miss if I could change
anything about this world I think it so
that I could have both a place to live
and heat because right now all I have is
a place to live
and it&#39;s sure cold young people are
amazing they don&#39;t judge what they&#39;re
going to say they tell us the truth in
this world and Franco is not the
exception in fact the teams that I have
with me today and the teams I work with
every single day are all amazing and
have amazing talents to share with you
all so the last thing that you can do is
to advocate for young people advocate
for their participation in the schools
that you your children go to or the
organizations that you support you can
ask in what ways could young people be
engaged here and then if you&#39;re saying
but Heather I don&#39;t know where to get
young people I promise you don&#39;t have to
drive up with a van marked candy all you
have to do is go and partner with the
place where young people are for the
majority of their day young people
they&#39;re in schools by and large and so
your organization can partner with
schools and leverage both of your
missions to ensure that young people are
having authentic innovation so young
people such as myself at 16 and my
neighbor who&#39;s 13 since Julia we&#39;re all
there standing on a bridge young people
they&#39;re ready to be engaged they&#39;re
hungry so my question to you is will you
reach out to them
