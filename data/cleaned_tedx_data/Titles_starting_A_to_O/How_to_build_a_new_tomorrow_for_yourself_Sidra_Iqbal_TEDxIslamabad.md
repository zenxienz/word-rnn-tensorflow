we often know how a story begins and
along the line we forget it so today I&#39;d
like to begin from the beginning this
happy photograph was actually taken on
14th May 1999 that is the day when I won
the english-speaking union&#39;s
international public speaking
championship this was taken in London
I&#39;m wearing a royal blue velvet shalwar
kameez that my mom specially made for
the day and I&#39;m smiling silly me 15 year
old smiling ear-to-ear
in spite of my braces that used to make
me very very conscious it is the day
when I became the first and the only
Pakistani to have won this competition
amongst 48 participants from 26
different countries and the same year in
December I was invited to the Buckingham
Palace to receive my winner&#39;s
certificate by His Royal Highness the
Duke of Edinburgh Prince Bella
not a lot of people get to remember but
I can remember it vividly that this is
the day and this is the achievement that
transformed my life it transformed my
life because for the first time I got to
feel my purpose my power my voice the
impact I can have in moving minds and in
connecting hearts and then there was no
looking back because this opportunity
opened a number of new gates for me new
opportunities for me and more
importantly it gave me wings but that&#39;s
only half of the story the other half is
where I&#39;d like to take you I had my own
unique set of challenges I am the eldest
sister I have to do other sisters it&#39;s
an all-girls household an upper
middle-class family and for my parents
the biggest life investment is not land
gold or saving bones but quality
education for the three of us therefore
I&#39;m lucky that my family believed more
in me than the societal stereotypes and
the fears
the people put in us but that came with
the heavy responsibility of always being
vigilant I needed to look out for myself
and as I need that transition from my
student life to my professional life the
stakes got higher the barriers got
tougher and of course the judgment
became harsher when I look back I
sometimes wonder what life had become
you know the life that I knew then and I
still do is riddled with with mind games
with office politics with nepotism and
heartbreaks
I learned the hard way that some doors
are going to close but through
persistence and hard work many more will
open life has continued to bless me I
have had Fame abundance growth come my
way alhamdulillah and today you know me
as a as a well-known broadcast
journalist as a successful professional
as somebody who can who you deem worthy
enough to invite to TEDx Islamabad so I
can speak to you but let me divorce
myself from the shiny success you know
this is my store Stream Li proud of it I
would never do anything another way the
way I have done it but more importantly
when I look around I see that success
stories are doing something detrimental
success stories us are you ignite in you
this this go-getter attitude but you
want to just break the barriers live
your dreams and be the person the shiny
person that you want you&#39;re you know
that you&#39;ve seen your role model to
become but in that quest in that mission
we sometimes gloss over the struggles
and the pains you don&#39;t tell you about
them and to the point that we sometimes
glorify them to be superhuman none of us
are superhumans we&#39;ve all had our
struggles but what is this culture the
culture that we are breathing in
Pakistan is all about irresponsible
glorification of imbalanced work lives
you are asked to become risk-averse this
personality worship you are too
over and over again about personal
choices being the most glorious of
sacrifices and you can&#39;t really match up
this is a culture where unfortunately
personal happiness has come laughs now
passion has taken a backseat to duty and
duty as leaving no room for mistake in
fact mistakes and failure become
lifelong shame so what does that do for
young people I feel that you&#39;re pushed
into this really unfair delusional race
to success in equipping you to actually
harness risks you&#39;re unable to actually
face fear and failure so in my talk
today dear friend like to focus exactly
on that the new tomorrow that you and I
both have to face after a setback what
happened is an taste failure do you give
up how do you put yourself up again how
do you pick up the broken pieces of your
shattered self glue them together and
become functional how do you go back to
being your inspired self when you&#39;re
lost in this is all else doubt pain and
loneliness well that&#39;s the topic that&#39;s
the subject but I feel that at the heart
of all these questions are two
fundamental elements the elements of
success and happiness and then I say
that as a society we have actually
misunderstood the relationship between
the two we believe and we you are
actually propagated to believe that
success is going to make you happen a
success creates happiness that is
floored my friends happiness on the
other hand does have a chance in
creating success I&#39;ll give you an
example winning a championship backing a
big project being famous or buying a new
car and all this can make me happy but
yes if I&#39;m relaxed if I&#39;m joyful if I&#39;m
Pleasant if I really enjoy what I do
I have a better chance of winning all
these things of achieving them and
actually enjoying them so somewhere
along the line Society came up with this
really faulty equation that wealth Fame
and success equals to happiness what did
it learn does is it creates a lot of
pressure on you it creates the pressure
to seek acceptance to seek security and
to gain control another question comes
to mind when you are pressured like that
as normal human beings you&#39;re more prone
to falter when you are pressurized and
we see examples of that every day
pilots crash divers drown leaders take
detrimental decisions such as going to
war all of this and then we turn around
and we say you know what they panicked
they chose one of the key questions that
comes to mind is what about the way they
failed does that not say something about
us it&#39;s all failure alike or the way we
fail actually tells us something about
who we are and how we think ladies and
gentlemen when you talk about failure it
is easy to club it and say that&#39;s it but
more importantly I would like to take
you to one of my most favorite sayings
about success this is by Winston
Churchill somebody I think one operator
and he say his success is stumbling from
failure to failure without the loss of
enthusiasm how do you do that the
mystery question is that I think even
before we get to how we do it let&#39;s
stick to one part and perhaps agree on
it the agreement I seek is that when we
talk about failure we have misunderstood
it we see it to be the opposite of
success failure in fact is part of the
journey you fail when you are trying to
avoid failure so therefore it&#39;s really
important to come up with a with a
strategy where you&#39;re able to actually
bounce back and I in my life have been
helped by three three ways of doing that
and I&#39;d like to share them with
the three remain are reminders must try
and your mind to I think the hardest
thing is breaking yourself up but these
reminders can really help the first one
if you live the people&#39;s acceptance you
are going to die of their rejection the
first question to ask yourselves when
you fail or when you think you are a
failure is what did is exactly fail at
is it even my own dream or is it a
borrowed belief system that I have
acquired and I&#39;m trying to live up to it
because you&#39;re most likely to fail and
hurt yourself when you are trying to
please people when you&#39;re trying to cut
yourself up to try and fit their
definition of success are you slogging
away in a corporate prison not getting
your promotion not getting the right
opportunity when in your heart of hearts
you have a wonderful idea and in your
free time your mind wanders to that and
you wish that you could put it in action
are you trying to be rich enough thin
enough fair enough gray low enough or
whatever enough it may be because people
tell you that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to be
accepted that&#39;s what&#39;s going to make you
more worthy the big question my friends
is to know the difference that&#39;s not
failure that is self-sabotage because
you&#39;re trying to please people and
that&#39;s an uphill task you&#39;re bound to
fail at the second reminder we&#39;re more
frightened than we are hurt we suffer
more often in imagination than in
reality
please remember this you know perception
is everything
perspective is everything when you look
around and you&#39;re feeling down in the
dumps and you&#39;re like okay I feel like a
failure I feel stressed I feel
frustrated I feel trapped
please remember that what you have
recognized is that this is a habit of
emotion it&#39;s just like working out what
you get used to what you tolerate you
get more of it and you will become used
to a bit words my friends are very very
powerful they&#39;re magically powerful they
can make you love or hate laugh or cry
fight or run away so you can either be
stressed or you be strong
you can either be frustrated or you be
passionate it&#39;s like working out going
to the gym it&#39;s like a muscle so
practice it harness it as much as you
can
the third reminder it&#39;s not failure but
the low aim that is the crime very
important reminder when you look around
and if you if you look at what exactly
have you failed you need to understand
how personal it is to you is it
something that you set out to do for
yourself because if you&#39;re only focused
on your personal gain you&#39;re more likely
to have bad days you&#39;re more likely to
look back and say oh that didn&#39;t work
out I didn&#39;t win that contract but when
you&#39;re trying to serve something much
larger than yourself when you attach
yourself to that divine post when you&#39;re
trying to serve your community when
you&#39;re trying to serve humanity when
you&#39;re trying to make a dent in the
market or in the universe at large
that&#39;s when you tap into this infinite
resource of zeal or insight of
inspiration and even if you fail at that
whether whether aim that high with an
attempt that glorious even failing is
amazing so I want you to remember these
three points which have helped me and I
feel that it&#39;s an ongoing journey
sometimes people turn around and ask me
said oh do you not have a bad day do you
not have a frustrated day where you just
want to quit it all of course I do but
that used to be my address that way I&#39;ve
moved and I urge you all to move as well
be a go-getter
and not be the person who gets bogged
down by failure in the end I want you to
take a look at this magnificent picture
it&#39;s that of a solar eclipse and this

was taken on the 21st of August 2:17 big
event you know people started to talk
about it and it got me thinking it got
me thinking that every failure every
heartbreak every setback is actually
like a solar eclipse
imagine this in the sky of our being the
Sun represents our passions our dreams
our true desires and suddenly it&#39;s dark
it&#39;s all goes away
but you remember that glimpse that light
which basically illuminates all these
wonderful things to your imagination and
you want to go for it the intensity of
your desire is also exactly like the Sun
it can burn you it can blind you it can
give you the unquenchable thirst and it
can also builder you to a point where
you start seeing mirages just like a
madman but more importantly do you know
that the word Eclipse in English
actually has a descendant in Greek
eclipses see and amongst all the words
that Eclipse he can mean one of the
things and inant so when you have failed
or you feel that your face has said bad
it&#39;s that abandonment your son has gone
away and that Sun is that fireball that
nut that anchors in an otherwise cold
cosmic world of course it&#39;s gonna hurt
but in that moment I just want you to
remember this analogy and know that you
have not been doomed you have not been
banished to a horrific permanent kind of
darkness but in fact it&#39;s a temporary
shadow oh wait the murky Gray&#39;s are
going to live the only thing you need to
remember is in that moment with all the
devotion that you can muster with all
the reverence that you can have with all
the dedication that you can have commit
yourself to something that you love
because when we talk about success you
think of bright and shiny things
if you want to shine like the Sun you
first have to burn like the Sun thank
you
[Applause]
