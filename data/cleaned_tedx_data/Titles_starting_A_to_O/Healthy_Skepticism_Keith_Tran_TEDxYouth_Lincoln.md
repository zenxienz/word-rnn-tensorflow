next year on August 17 2018 the TEDx
Year Program will officially make it
mandatory for LPS students to attend the
speaker&#39;s presentations any LPS students
not in attendance will be more cash
truant and face the appropriate
consequences can you believe it
well you should because it&#39;s not true
this is an example of fake news now
before I begin my presentation here&#39;s a
little something about me my classmates
parents teachers and everyone have voted
me the rumor buster for the last three
years I do not like spreading rumors but
I do like to plant the truth and correct
people when they&#39;re wrong and sometimes
I do spread the truth so when you have a
rumor you&#39;re unsure about you know who
to call the thing is I tend to be a busy
person though because I enter correcting
many misconceptions so because there&#39;s
always that one person that spread some
alternative rumors the thing is we are
all drawn to this a story that is too
good to be true
luckily in America there&#39;s a high demand
for these people in the field of
journalism and politics so instead of
producing alternative rumors they can
produce alternative facts in fact the
Federal Department assisted statistics
finds that one out of every seven point
five six articles contain major
falsehoods let that sink in for a moment
one out of every seven point five six
articles because if that statistic is
true our country is doomed to fail
miserably it&#39;s not I just made it up
which leads me to my point that we
should be a little skeptical of stories
facts of statistics that&#39;s not a lure
too good to be true in other words
fake news so what is fake news
Paul Chadwick a journalist editor lawyer
whitey Ford a guardian and this is a
real definition family real article
defiance fake news as fiction is
deliberately fabricated and presented as
nonfiction with the intent to mislead
recipients into treating fiction as SPAC
or intra doubting birth libel evidence
that&#39;s a mouthful one an easier
definition I&#39;m guessing the President of
the United States was simply treated
definition eyes fake news is news that
is fake period an actuality the term
it&#39;s up doesn&#39;t have a single definition
it is constantly changing is being used
in ways that users want it to be using
false information in an election isn&#39;t
all that new dating all the way back to
1522
Pietro Aquino tries to manipulate
elections by writing harmful poems an
example of his literary satire with CERN
he aim is poetic slandered at Adrian
Florence who is campaigning to become
Pope Pietro called Adrian their German
ring war today but you really cannot do
that because let&#39;s face it a lot of us
fell asleep during the poetry unit in
our English class but what most of us
are gutta are using our phones which we
spend a lot of time on so instead of
fake views in the form of poems and
newspaper fake news can explode on
platforms like social media where every
tweet sharing light creates an echo
chamber of falsehoods fake news
invalidates important political issues
and raises questions through irrelevant
but I catch him a good example of this
is a pizza gate scandal the occurred in
a 2016 election originally it started as
a simple rumor on Twitter which quickly
escalated into a dangerous situation
a gunman fired directly at a pizza
restaurant in DC
his reason he was completely convinced
that hooli Clinton was operating a
pedophile ring out of the basement of
the pizzeria he was in DC along with
even dozens of demonstrators to protest
demanding the government to look into
this case the truth is there was no
basement
apparently pietre time travel of 2016
to serve a pizza what is poetry in a
world without petrol improper pizzerias
and alternative facts we all may be able
to actually trust each other how can we
truly be indivisible where we&#39;re so
easily divided by lies let&#39;s take a
journey to places that this figure out a
lot better than we do in sweden students
or school as young as 10 or how consume
news in Czech Republic high school
teachers instruct teens on how to
identify propaganda from Russia and in
the United States public officials are
only starting to propose media literacy
standards in public schools more school
systems to start combating this
alternative fact epidemic one of the
ways is to have a curriculum that
teaches us to distinguish news from fake
news teaching teams to be skeptical in
choirs can leave tennis and other
perspectives and not fall into the trap
of fake news in the 21st century the
internet is exaggerating this problem in
school systems to treat it like a 21st
century problem by promoting and
teaching online civic reasoning but
until then what do we do we all use our
phones every day it&#39;s going Pass one
headline article after another until we
see something interesting fortunately
there are ways to detect fake news here
are the three ways to detect fake news
number two or shock you
number one saw what the headline if it
sounds like satire or something too good
to be true it&#39;s probably fake news if
you see a headline claiming that the CIA
realizes that they have been using a
black highlighter you should be
skeptical I mean do you really think
back letters even exists but don&#39;t stop
there
we haven&#39;t even read the article where
the content is really important
headlines are not accurate
representation of the article itself
number two check the source check the
source if it sounds like if they if the
author has crazy credentials or is not
be identified that should raise a big
red flag the website itself also gives a
big clue about the truthfulness of the
story if you see other articles like
nine-year-old AXA discovery cure for
cancer world death three is steadily
approaching eighty five percent all from
the same source
you should be regretting even waste your
time on this website
beware of new source does not slow to a
test of time and you have not familiar
with number three check the evidence
many times fake news outlets don&#39;t have
evidence for their claims and even if
they do it&#39;s often not accurate
reputable news source have the incentive
to provide drinking news that is
accurate or else they would face a
backlash in contrast fake news has the
intent to produce articles that tricks
people in to believing falsehoods then
there is also fake news there&#39;s a little
heart to sniff out and many times
credible source can also stay untrue
claims websites like polly deepak fat
check and Snopes are all designed to
assist everyone into debunking bogus
statements if a journalistic or
political claim trips are warning your
head it&#39;s always a good idea to check it
with another rep your own news source
using these tools we all can be a rumour
buster with enough people we can even
form our own rumor Buster team
your classmates parents teachers and
everyone might cause nosey but I call it
critical thinking instead of getting
rumors or news from one source listen
and find these from many sources because
ultimately when we understand our biases
and the biases of others we reach a
point to respect other perspectives and
not fall into a trap of fake news we
cannot let fake news continue Misco
rising perspectives where leads to
distrust I heard this rumor the global
warming is not real another devastating
effect on the environment intensifying
natural disasters and devastating effect
on the environment is not real I heard
this rumor that other local pizzerias
all places for politicians who operated
on pedophile ring I heard this rumor
that said that sandy hooks was a hoax
that the victims losing their children
in the shootings was a staged scene in a
conspiracy stories facts and statistics
that we take for granted now or makes
with lies and fabricated data that blows
the mind for reality in a turn of
reality in this world there&#39;s plenty of
exciting real facts and knowledge we
don&#39;t need alternative facts I&#39;ve heard
I one final rumor for you I heard people
whisper that our generation cannot
overcome the major global challenges we
face or these rumors really true let us
use some healthy skepticism
