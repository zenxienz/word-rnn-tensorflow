hello hello just gonna put this down and
call it the white elephant in the room
we&#39;ll get to this one so runnin with
some of the other themes that we won on
today I&#39;m a musician
I guess that&#39;s my night job my day job
is producing records and here in Houston
I teach a lot everything from juniors
and seniors at Christopher a Jesuit I
teach the juniors ethnomusicology and
twenty-six of them and they played they
play it&#39;s mostly drumming based but they
come in with pretty much zero musical
backgrounds and we just finished playing
an arrangement of a salsa tune by Hector
Lavoe which is great my seniors are
learning to record music and a program
called Ableton Live and they&#39;re learning
to produce and learning to write music
and compose even though none of them
know how to read music or know anything
behind it the whole point behind that
and it weighs into other teaching I do I
teach production at Houston Community
College I work with the dance department
at University of Houston and I teach
little little kids four five six years
old
which is all the blast part of being a
musician is you can only perform so much
during the day so almost everyone I know
who does this professionally we all
teach and it&#39;s a great way to keep your
knowledge good keep your practice good
but also really just get to know what it
is that you do what is your connection
to music and what I can share that my
connection to music is connection as a
drummer I am a team player I don&#39;t even
like drum solos I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think
most people want to go buy a t-shirt or
a beer when you have the drum solo
happening but what I do like is
providing a context to keep everyone
working together
I love playing dance music my main gig
is a band called escort we play live
disco and it is an absolute blast
creating an environment for people to
move and connect it because what do we
have what we have is the oldest language
in the book
everyone here is a musician you were
before you could walk you were before
you could talk my son is two and a half
years old and before he could even say
data
he could sing his favorite song or
clapping rhythm I didn&#39;t teach him that
I&#39;m not forcing anything on him he just
picked that up so from before
you are verbal before you&#39;re ambulatory
you are a musician this is the first
connection you have the sound of your
parents singing is probably the most
important connection you&#39;ve got so what
I have here is a really big drum they
come bigger but this one&#39;s a good size
my dad&#39;s from India from North India and
state called Punjab and this is a drum
from there purchased in Delhi but made
in Punjab anyone know what it&#39;s called
yeah this is why I love being in Sugar
Land I get a yes this is called the dole
so dole from like let&#39;s say from Romania
over to China dole essentially just
means two-headed drum there&#39;s Armenian
versions of the dole there&#39;s Turkmen
versions of the dole it&#39;s always dramas
got two sides and you play both sides so
let&#39;s go through the ecology of this guy
I&#39;ve got a big wooden shell here this is
one piece if you buy a drum made in the
States it&#39;s made out of plywood this you
have to cut down a tree put it on a
lathe and hollow it out it takes about
four or five days then you gotta let it
dry then you gotta carve it which takes
about a month I know this because I
hired a guy to do it it was pretty
awesome comes with a strap easy for
carrying and then I&#39;ve got as I said two
heads played with sticks so this one
plays the one on my left side this is
called the Douga it&#39;s curved no one
knows why seriously in a culture where
the classical music is thousands of
years old and codified down to
everything when you play tabla you have
a name for every note and you have
compositions they&#39;re composed hundreds
of years old down to you know every
hundred twenty eighth measure that you
repeat you have lots and lots of context
but in dole this is a folk instrument so
a lot of stuff got lost we have no idea
why this is curved when I ask people
they say well we like to play with the
roots and it&#39;s less work to just
straighten it out so they cut up the
root from a tree that&#39;s nice and heavy
and here we go
this stick I use for my right hand this
is called Attili or Chucky it&#39;s made out
of cane really really flexible so what
does that do well the way the drum
sounds the way the drums played the
rhythms that are played on the
instrument sure they&#39;re culturally
significant but they&#39;re that way sort of
because these are my tools so let&#39;s look
at what I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got low note
called gay a high note called na and as
you can see there&#39;s not a ton of
subtlety in here this is a loud drum
it&#39;s quite easy to connect to right so
the dole Duncan job is almost mythical
this is a community drum this is meant
for accompanying weddings and mostly
weddings and weddings and celebrations
and weddings and weddings and weddings
and weddings this is a drum of
celebration this is a drum of community
even when you see videos songs that
don&#39;t have dole in it you might see the
pictures of it because just the
iconography of this instrument connects
people together the Punjabi the aspera
could be you know Holi put together just
by the dole people will connect around
that food your food has regional
differences but this drum from the dhaba
of the hamato Pradesh everywhere else in
Punjab including Pakistan this is the
guy so what does it sound like let&#39;s see
again this stick since it&#39;s so wispy
it&#39;s hard for me to just play straight
but it&#39;s very easy for me to swing and
sort of roll along like that then on my
low side I have all the punctuation over
here all the exclamation points that
make the rhythm exciting
so people ask what&#39;s the significance of
all those rhythms well they&#39;re a made
for people to move to this is not a
sitting down instrument this is not art
music this is physical music and at a
broader sense when you go to certain
temples when you go especially in Lahore
this is an instrument used to accompany
really intense worship and the rhythm

played is this at about 11:00 p.m. by

3:00 a.m. intense the rhythm is called
the mall anyone want to translate for me
fun yeah but more like wild abandon and
it plays into the sort of relationship
of Sufi worship being a mystic
relationship between you and your God
but the music is the pathway to it and
it&#39;s essentially just intoxication so
what do we have here
everyone&#39;s a musician everyone&#39;s
connected via music rhythm is the basis
of music this big drum gives you rhythm
do it right it might get you on the way
to God thank you
