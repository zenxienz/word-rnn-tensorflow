selamat hello everyone my name is
Larissa anawa and today I want to tell
you a story about a decade&#39;s old enemy
how he became my Valentines um anyway on
August 10th of 1998 when I was still 17
slightly older than Sadiq I planned my
father his 59th birthday letter and I
ended it with words that harkened
expression be careful with what you wish
for in the closing of that birthday
letter because what do you really buy
for the deputy prime minister blazer I
wrote to annoy Ibrahim this veteran
political activist Papa I&#39;ve never had
to fight for anything other than good
grades and basically rewards for my good
behavior all my achievements and
everything else tell me how was it like
for you when you were busy demonstrating
to fight poverty for the for farmers
embodying tell me how it felt like tell
me if life could mean more than just
studying so by 20th of September 1998 I
basically got my answer and annoyed
brahim sacking is Deputy Prime Minister
weeks earlier by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad led to one of the biggest
protest rallies in the country it was
more important it was my first rally
I&#39;ve never had attended any
demonstration before and let me tell you
this hundreds of thousands of people in
one particular setting it was just
phenomenal and of course they were
demanding Mijares resignation and they
called for reforms in a country they
felt that was dominated and controlled
by one man so it was exciting
exciting day I was sooner with my jacket
shirt you know all unassuming felt very
encouraged elated at night our lives
changed forever so that very same night
you had armed commandos who broke into
our home pointed machine guns at my
siblings including many others and
arrested my father where they dragged
him wealth you know your fun of all of
us and they handcuffed and they fight
for that him and I felt I remember the
feeling of being so powerless that was
the most powerless moment in my life and
I I remember not one thing to feel that
way ever again and after he disappeared
that night we found out later he was
beaten still blind fold that in
handcuffed by the Chief of Police of
Malaysia and he was left untreated
conscious for this so but you know
what&#39;s important is it wasn&#39;t just my
family there was cause of others
presidents of non-governmental
organizations who pledged support and
sympathy for unknow Ibrahim and the
reform movement they were all detail so
when you had family members who felt so
angry they blamed one person who was
responsible for taking away their loved
ones so for me for more than a week we
could not see him we didn&#39;t know where
he was and then we started just
basically writing letters at the time in
1998 the fax machine was the ball no one
emailed anybody people just effect
letters so that&#39;s what we did we fetch
the police station bombarding them with
requests demands to see our father and
finally one day Hana
my younger sister she was six at the
time she fell ill and doing her illness
she also decided scribble or not to most
Hassan that then investigating officer
and she wrote in that note we&#39;re simply
to one Haneda mom Hannah not jumper Papa
and she placed a tiny thumbprint and
believe it or not within 24 hours we did
get to see our father and it was very
difficult and painful to see him because
he was so frail was beaten but he still
had the same smile and that&#39;s still
strong spirit and you know I just did to
share with you I mean Hana scroll
Hannah&#39;s thumbprint if a six-year-old
could manage to exact change I mean that
was the moment I felt no one was
powerless so my father&#39;s imprisonment
was the ultimate crisis in my life it&#39;s
a good crisis because as you know in
life you&#39;re never going to be devoid of
any problems but in hindsight it was
also the fate they brought about greater
heights of maturity and a very steep
learning curve that was very valuable
for me so I had to take off a year from
my studies which is very difficult
unlike most of you actually love do
University life and at 18 I was a real
nerd at 18 I became and began this
nationwide and and sort of world white
world alone many others to meet with
concern activists and Malaysians
everywhere to seek support not just for
the release of my father and other
political prisoners but to promote the
reform agenda and you know for me it was
very important because if the second
most powerful man in the country could
be treated so unjustly imagine the
average person in Malaysia imagine the
panel from Guam oosa imagine the Orang
Asli from rawa imagined refugees some of
whom I met
the Police lockups and all detail in
detention centers
what militia and imagines their fate so
I eventually was able to continue my
studies at unit 10 but I wanted to tell
you I was actually denied from
International Islamic University the
University my father founded and funded
and the reason was I was too politically
toxic to be allowed in so it is good
because you can empathize with the
plight of many others and of course I
shied away from a formal political rule
for myself for as long as I could I took
up engineering and by 2008 scores of my
comrades who decided to contest in their
particular elections and they asked him
to join along and I thought you know if
I didn&#39;t do this and if I just joined
shell or any other multinational
companies I might live to regret that
decision
I had to be part of such a pivotal
moment when I lose I mean it was such an
important moment for democracy requires
Democrats and reform requires reformists
so in 2008 I join my colleagues and
extremely supportive people of the BOP
and I assured me into that they were not
yet I remember something I was just born
my first child and you know of course
you hadn&#39;t extended families Member of
Parliament but it was just really
wonderful you know it was really a sense
of empowerment because people entrusted
you with such an important role to be
their representative in the parliament
so what do I do so you know I was driven
because I didn&#39;t want to just be a
passive follower I wanted to be an
active participant this is what my
country and the future is supposed to be
what I partake and decide to do with it
and somewhere along the way I wanted to
right the wrongs that&#39;s been committed
reportedly how else would I prove I
wasn&#39;t just unwise doctor I care a lot
about the realization of reforms it
wasn&#39;t just about I&#39;m lost freedom that
would make me feel that&#39;s enough let&#39;s
go back to life let&#39;s go back to the
normalcy of being an engineer in a
multinational company but life is really
what we experience day to day not this
idea of perfection we think we deserve
one way or the other
I wanted Malaysia to Accord equal
opportunities to all citizens I wanted
the rule of law to thrive I wanted
multiracialism to be our binding force
and I wanted to see an end to racial and
religious politics and of course I
wanted the media to be the vanguard to
voice out against any excesses did you
know most of all I want to Sofia and
Harris my children to grow up in a
country that will celebrate their
talents not based on who they know or
who they didn&#39;t know we&#39;re really having
the equal opportunity to thrive and
succeed and the system it meant witches
and earth all these experiences against
me my comrades and many other Malaysians
it would seem failed all of us and also
failed to not Mahathir Mohamad who came
to realize it by 2015 so can you imagine
after all those years by September 2016
something huge happened as Bernie
Sanders would put it huge right this
former prime minister who reigned over
Malaysia for 22 years decided to bring
himself to court to support Anwar my
father the man he imprisoned 18 years
earlier in a--not a suit against the
government&#39;s new national security laws
which we considered laconian I arrived
to cut a little bit ID but the big news
that shook everyone
was the handshake that took place
between the two who had not met each
other for 18 long years
so entered the the witness room where
they said together and I saw a hunched
over 92 year old man looking pensively
almost gently I could not bring myself
to shake his hands yet it was so
overwhelming like the emotions but I
felt sad I remember feeling said in my
grandfather was alive he would be the
same age as done are they you know and
having that resolve to come to court
play a Jing principal support against
this extreme law I mean the activist in
me you know had to applaud that you know
yeah I I find myself you know I was
caught not to hit the individual person
and I don&#39;t hate him I felt sad I felt
said that all these years have passed on
gone by with so much hurt and pain and I
also wanted is to focus on the actions
against fighting injustice so I told
myself then I&#39;m going to be ready to
observe his actions I&#39;m going to support
them if they were aligned with my
principles and I think when I finally
came home that night you know initially
you felt very angry you know so many
emotions but I felt this hatred for
Mohave that I had kept for so long
against his actions of course but still
there&#39;s a lot of bitterness was directed
at this person who may have has have had
his own epiphany was I ready to change
myself as well you know forgiveness is a
funny thing when you forgive others
eventually forgive the most bitter part
of
self and you learn to move on because
people like to move and walk with a huge
chip on your shoulder
you can&#39;t walk straight that way you
need to be able to let go of your ghosts
so that hand shit was an important
stepping stone for united nation long
divided by painful strife we needed to
meant we needed to heal really I needed
to heal and will the reforms and I&#39;m
proud to say that I believed in unity
based on principle and a proven public
commitment to change that only is it
justified to let those who hurt us in
the past even in seemingly helping us to
do good for others so I started to past
with that handshake the first in
engaging to Mohave and his team
clarifying the issue reform I see there
were essential crucial for my side
before we could have a United
collaboration and the second was
reflecting on the wisdom to do what was
best for our nation above my personal
angst and you know I believe that we
should forgive those who commit to
change I want to join with good but
believing that in your mind and feeling
it in your heart and then putting it
into practice are very different things
so five months after the handshake I
found myself face to face sharing the
stage with Tonetta Mahathir Mohamad on
the 14th of February this year and after
months and months of back-channel
negotiations to confirm his real change
and my own months of self introspection
I invited him for my fundraising dinner
and because for me to maha day was open
to join a unity for principle and
because i had also succeeded overcoming
my own pain and anger to focus on what
was necessary for justice to prevail and
so the dinner for your benefit was held
in the fourth in a february and i didn&#39;t
have the chance to seek javi joeys
approval but i referred
as Valentine&#39;s Day for your benefit not
mine but it just became so important
because both of us didn&#39;t really have
private dates he brought his date and
all ESMA and you know it was such a
meaningful dig I guess and later when I
met puddin maha day during Ramadan I was
my first time sitting in his living room
we agreed that we were gonna work
towards the future and there you have it
I can&#39;t mention the particular name here
but the issue is unity based on
principles so my message today for all
of you in all that you face all the
challenges that you may have to overcome
it&#39;s about the imperative for action and
the power of forgiveness we are all
empowered one way or the other and it&#39;s
imperative that we take action in
whatever we can to improve the situation
in our lives and of course the community
around us if the latter of a
six-year-old could prove useful in
securing a family visit to visit the a
political prisoner of a father imagine
what you can do you brains out here
today if you&#39;re retired ophthalmologist
and an 18 year old together with a group
of non political stakeholders can power
an entire reform movement imagine what
thousands of Malaysian University
students can do if they get engaged and
if I could confront my deepest fears
regret and sadness to forgive and engage
with a former dictator after he has
decided to embrace reforms imagine what
Malaysia can be we can really truly
overcome anything now I think it&#39;s very
important to understand that we have to
continuously stay involved and we have
to always walk with a straight path
without any chips on our shoulders you
might be wanting to contribute to your
university you might we wanted to
contribute to a non-governmental
organization you might be wanting to
stand for elections
but what&#39;s important here focused
what&#39;s important here is really you have
to do it with a clear conscience and you
can&#39;t do it with a hang-up whatever has
happened to you in the past when you
offer yourself you can&#39;t offer it with a
ghost of your past hanging over you it&#39;s
about moving forward it&#39;s about building
and powering the future life is very
beautiful every second that you live it
and I always thought being an engineer
was far better but heck no heck no I
mean heck no so for me you know I&#39;ve met
so many people learn from the best and
my best moment I tell you was when I was
actually detained beside two and four
year old Vietnamese refugees because
I&#39;ve seen how these kids can survive and
smile and laugh in the lockup cell and I
told myself I would not create that
moment experience for just working in a
multinational company not a it&#39;s not
good it&#39;s good nice good it&#39;s very
useful you see the money is good but
allow me to end by saying my dear
students and my dearest colleagues and
comrades if I could finish my
presentation in sharing session with you
today with one thought just let it be
be empowered take action please make
Malaysia your Valentines
thank you
you
