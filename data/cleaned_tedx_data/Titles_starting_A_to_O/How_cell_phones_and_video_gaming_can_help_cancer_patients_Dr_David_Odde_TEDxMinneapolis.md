it&#39;s great to be here Minneapolis my
hometown
[Applause]
movies we live in an amazing digital
technology age mobile devices and online
retail are changing the way we live and
work we&#39;re seeing the emergence of
artificial intelligence and with it the
potential for self-driving cars but most
importantly we can make cat videos this
is my cat salt being cute and I shot
this movie using my phone very proud of
that movies are powerful because they
capture motion and they can tell a story
all I could stop there and that would be
the best TED talk ever thank you
I didn&#39;t want to tell you about tonight
is a story about how we are missing a
great opportunity for using movies to
diagnose and treat cancer and I remember
growing up in Minneapolis and having the
opportunity through a summer school
program to see through a microscope
micro organism swimming in pond water
that I had collected I became fascinated
by biological motion and guess what I
still study it today in my laboratory at
the University of Minnesota we study
cancer and in recent years have come to
focus on the aggressive brain tumor
known as glioblastoma glioblastoma is a
devastating disease median survival is
about 15 months despite surgery
chemotherapy radiation and most recently
tumor treating electrical fields Ted
Kennedy Beau Biden Eleanor Mondale all
succumbed to brain tumors and just this
past summer Senator John McCain was
diagnosed with glioblastoma so you might
think as I did that since cancer is
driven by the dynamic growth and
movement of cancer cells within the body
and since we have such amazing digital
imaging technology that clinics would be
routinely filming cancer patient cells
surprisingly we don&#39;t instead clinical
diagnosis relies on a combination of MRI
and lab pathology now MRI is incredibly
powerful in providing spatial detail and
guiding surgical removal of tumors this
individual was diagnosed with
glioblastoma underwent surgery chemo
radiation and entered a Phase two
clinical trial which didn&#39;t work and
within six months had passed away from
the disease typically for such patients
only one or a few scans are collected
because there the scans are quite
expensive typically costing thousands of
dollars per scan compare that to $800
smartphone that can capture thousands of
movies each having thousands of frames
and in addition can be used for texting
web browsing movie watching gaming and
even phoning
people still do that MRI in addition to
being expensive and capturing pictures
not movies does not capture cellular
level information cellular information
is obtained by so-called histopathology
where tumor tissue is chemically fixed
and stained and viewed through a
microscope by a highly trained
pathologist however the method that&#39;s
used today is essentially the same
method that existed nearly a hundred
years ago meaning that Senator McCain&#39;s
tumor was diagnosed using the same
technology that existed when he was born
in 1936 so I began to wonder might live
sell movies be the weapon we&#39;ve been
missing in our fight against cancer
might they enable dramatic improvements
in our ability to understand the
aggressiveness of an individual cancer
patients tumor and enable us to better
identify the chemo therapies that will
work for that patient in fact we can
make these lifestyle movies this is what
brain cancer cell invasion looks like
these are proliferating glioblastoma
cells migrating into small micro
channels that we&#39;ve fabricated to mimic
the tight confines of the brain that
cells have to squeeze through in order
to invade and we imaged it using a
camera chip that&#39;s essentially the same
as that in my phone directly observing
these dynamics allows us to see cancer
cells and thereby biomechanical outputs
so that we can target our therapies
directly towards those we can even see
the tracks that cancer cells used to
invade these green cancer cells are
tracking along red blood vessels as they
invade into the brain and these dynamics
are not unique to brain cancer cell
migration is important for the invasion
and metastasis of a wide range of
cancers when we look at cancer cell
migration through the microscope we see
them dynamically extending and
retracting protrusions these
tentacle-like protrusions formed by
protein self-assembly into filaments and
that self-assembly pushes the membrane
forward but at the same time elec
Motors pull the filaments backwards away
from the membrane and toward the cell
body those motor forces can be
transmitted to the environment through a
set of protein bonds that I will refer
to as sticky proteins together the
molecular motors act as tiny muscles and
the sticky proteins as tiny shoes that
allow cells to get traction in their
environment to move through it and we&#39;re
now trying to determine what the sticky
proteins are in brain cancer so that we
can control them working with my
University of Minnesota colleague the
late John O fest who developed a mouse
model for glioblastoma we found that the
level of sticky protein influenced Mouse
survival what we found was that mice at
either low or high levels of sticky
protein live longer than mice at middle
levels of sticky protein kind of valley
of survival when we looked at how fast
cells proliferate we didn&#39;t see any
dependence on sticky protein it was
independent of it then we looked at cell
migration and this is what we saw you
can see the tumor mass in the lower left
and individual cancer cells migrating
away from the tumor into the surrounding
brain tissue when we quantified the rate
at which they&#39;re moving
we found an inverse correlation fastest
migration where there was poor survival
you can see that there&#39;s a peak in
migration that coincides with a valley
of survival as indicated by the red
arrow then we looked at human data each
point on this graph represents a single
cancer patient and they&#39;re plotted on
the graph by the stickiness level they
had and how long they survived after
diagnosis and you can see how variable
stickiness is amongst the patients some
are low some are medium some are high so
stickiness good or bad well if we start
at the low level of stickiness on the
left and follow the black curve survival
gets worse as stickiness increases but
then it bottoms out and rises again it
gets better again it means that we&#39;re
survival is at the middle level of
stickiness just like the mouse then we
looked at another human data set
bigger than this one same result middle
stickiness worse survival so together
the mouse data and the human data told
us that the worst survival is at the
middle stickiness level and in the mouse
that&#39;s where cell migration was fastest
in fact this is what our theory had
predicted built we built a cell
migration simulator using a simple
biophysical rules and we built from
earlier seminal work by Doug Laughlin
Berger now at MIT and his students and
this is what the model looks like here
you can see individual protrusions
extend and retract according to Newton&#39;s
laws of motion and the individual sticky
bond proteins engage and break under
load as determined by random number
generator on the computer and with this
we could predict how fast cells migrate
as a function of the stickiness level on
the left at low stickiness cells send
out protrusions but they don&#39;t stick
very well they slip as if they&#39;re on ice
in a Minneapolis winter tough break kid
it&#39;s happened to me on the right you can
see the protrusions go out it&#39;s as if
they&#39;re stuck they can&#39;t let go in any
direction it&#39;s as if they&#39;re bogged down
in mud in all directions too bad for mud
guy but in the middle these protrusions
are just can get enough grip but not so
much that they can&#39;t also let go which
allows them to move fast
kind of like Fitness Man here so we&#39;ve
got three cases low medium and high but
only in the middle case is fast and
that&#39;s exactly what we saw with the
mouse data to move fast you need to have
both the muscles to power you and the
right Footwear to match the track that
you&#39;re on so what does all that mean for
cancer patients our solid migration
simulator would predict for the clinical
trial of a stickiness protein blocking
drug that patients in the middle level
would actually do well with this drug
the reason is they&#39;re at their peak
performance optimal stickiness and if we
block it we knock them off their game
and they start to slip as if there are
nice so that&#39;s good but if we take the
patients throughout low stickiness to
begin with
and treat them they were already
slipping on ice so probably no effect
but think about the third case the
patients at high stickiness level if we
don&#39;t completely block them and drive
all the way through that peak they might
end up in the middle and get worse and
now if you take all three of those cases
together no effect got better got worse
an average them no effect overall in
fact recently a phase three clinical
trial was completed for a stickiness
protein blocking drug for glioblastoma
patients now phase three clinical trial
is the most expensive trial you can do
it builds on years of research and
typically costs altogether on the order
of 1 billion dollars that&#39;s for
reference equal to all of the budget
that&#39;s been allocated towards the cancer
moonshot that trial failed and sadly we
would have predicted it would have
failed and the reason is the trial did
not discriminate between low medium and
high stickiness levels instead they
treated all the patients of the same we
would have recommended treating the
middle group mean that patients need to
be classified and treatments
personalized based on the predictions of
the simulator in recent years simulators
have become commonplace airplanes
chemical plants computer chips they&#39;re
all extensively simulated according to
known physical chemical rules before the
risk is taken and the investments made
to send up a test plane to actually
build the chemical plant to actually
fabricate the computer chips even
golfers have simulators and this guy&#39;s
grip looks a little wonky to me but
that&#39;s the beauty the simulator he can
play around with his grip it can be
wonky he can figure out which clubs work
for him that&#39;s not what is happening in
cancer and drug discovery instead a
trial and error approach has been used
instead of simulating and the result has
been low success in the clinic about 25
percent success rate in Phase two
clinical trials
five percent success rate in brain
cancer trials and then correspondingly
high drug costs to pay for the cost of
failure in each and every one of those
failures so we&#39;ve left not one but two
major weapons against cancer sitting on
the table one live cell dynamics from
cancer from cancer patients tissue and
two mathematical computational models
such as the cell migration simulator
informed by these movies with which to
predict individual patient prognosis and
potential therapeutic strategies the
good news is the technology to do that
exists right now I mentioned my phone
and the camera chip my lab group
routinely stores and processes terabytes
of live cell movie data high-intensity
illuminators such as LEDs and lasers a
relatively cheap thanks to consumer
demand for video graphic displays and
also for telecom and we use them to make
high quality fluorescence movies and
what about the simulations they require
high performance computing here again
the consumer market comes to the rescue
thanks to video gaming Thank You gamers
yes
graphical processing units or GPUs were
built for gamers so you get high-speed
graphics from highly parallel processing
well guess what that technology is now
driving self-driving cars and
self-driving cars rely on the two things
I mentioned for cancer movies plus
models to predict and control car
behavior and complex dynamic
environments this is exactly the
approach that is not happening in cancer
and drug discovery and development
without even realizing it by making our
cat videos by watching movies online by
playing video games you&#39;ve helped set
the stage for a new era of cancer when
driven by live cell movies and
mathematical computational modeling so
here in Minneapolis
at the University of Minnesota we are
doing it with funding from the NIH s
National Cancer Institute for new
physical sciences in oncology Center we
are collecting live cell data and using
it to inform our biophysical models
working with surgeons and oncologists we
are currently enrolling patients at the
University of Minnesota Hospital to
collect their tumor tissue and use it
for our for our research but the thing
we do that&#39;s different that&#39;s not
standard in the clinic where the first
step is to either kill or discard that
tumor tissue we try to keep it alive as
best we can so here we&#39;re more like an
organ transplant surgeon but instead of
transplanting to a recipient patient we
transplant the tissue from the operating
room to our microscope where we collect
live cell movies overnight in
biologically realistic environments in
many cases while the patient is still in
recovery from surgery we view tumor
tissue as a vital precious living entity
that potentially contains valuable
dynamic information within it finally we
use that live cell data to inform our
simulators to predict patient outcomes
and in the process we aim to transform
oncology driven by an engineering
approach that fully leverages the
exponential growth of digital imaging
computing and physics based modeling to
stop cancer in its tracks
thank you
