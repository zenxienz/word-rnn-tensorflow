the way a poem begins you can never tell
if the words are already written or if
they form as you speak meaning is
derived from ways reverberating through
the air and gestures form from
convenience the way a poem is structured
you are supposed to question its form
each word a new opportunity to learn
about the craft of your choosing you
form the canvas and the brushes your
hands your sound your voice the way a
poem pulses you pulse with the heartbeat
the rythm not quite in time the rhyme
not quite right you form the dips and
valleys and the highest peaks of truth
and you realize so to us everyone beside
you
to write a poem is to form a bond with
the page and the person in front whose
eyes become your own and whose memories
become your acrylics and clay you add to
these emotions and wisdom cherish dreams
and fascinations you read other poems
and start to wonder whether poems are
written by people at all these words
closer to themselves than to those of
conversations you realize that a poem is
a reaction a lesson a glance from the
perspective of one apart from you to be
a poet is to choose to tell and to
present a choice it is reactionary and
raw and to speak as a poet is to act a
truth the closer to reality you bring
your words the more they become your own
you avoid cliches and one-off fits
finding purpose in the original and the
mundane you seek experiences and people
and you find your craft and proves the
more you read you believe in the art and
the poem begins to form to write a poem
is to imagine alternate worlds crafted
by words you write each phrase with the
precision of a watchmaker finding flaws
in the pairings and triplets carving
tragedies into blocks and stanzas making
sure to space out your line so they can
stand on their own
when you release the poem begins to flow
until the lines are no longer dividers
but transitions from one person to the
next and hands become steps from which
you whisper your sorrows and regrets hi
my name is Sharon Lin and this year I
was a 2017 york city youth poet laureate
for the past year my role has been to
educate middle and high school students
about creative writing and poetry as
well as to advocate for literacy in our
education system one problem I
consistently encountered among emerging
and amateur writers is a lack of
confidence in putting out their work as
a young artist myself I found it
incredibly difficult sometimes to have
other people critique your work but it&#39;s
one of the steps that&#39;s absolutely
crucial to developing as a creative
individual poetry is an art form that is
always changing and always has been in
the poetry classes I&#39;ve taken
we&#39;ve gone from sonnets some Shakespeare
all the way to postmodern minimalism and
even so whenever I ask my friends about
poetry most of them just answer isn&#39;t it
just Emily Dickinson Edgar Allen Poe or
some other Victorian age poet with
eloquent phrases and flowery languages
modern poetry occupies a niche that&#39;s
very rarely traversed in modern
literature apart from the dedicated
poetry community there are a few who
actively engage with modern poetry and
yet it contains such a rich compendium
of opportunities to engage with
perspectives apart from yours especially
those pertaining to issues such as
social justice perhaps the most
interesting thing about poetry is that
it&#39;s one of very few genres of
literature where real meaning and
emotional meaning can be gleaned from
the work even for those unfamiliar with
the medium itself this is especially
prevalent in performance and spoken word
poetry where there&#39;s a direct
correlation between the effect of the
poem and the audience engagement my
personal journey as a youth poet
laureate and a poet probably began in
the later years of high school I&#39;d
always written poem
from as early as I can remember but I
never considered myself really
well-versed in the media I didn&#39;t even
consider myself a writer for a long part
of my life and the mere thought of
performing something I had written on
stage terrified me even so it was around
senior year of high school when I signed
up for a spoken-word competition for the
first time I did it on a whim and I
didn&#39;t really know much about the world
of spoken word poetry but I started
watching videos of other performers
whose names I&#39;d gleaned from different
chat books I&#39;d read or ads I&#39;d picked up
on New York City subways I found that
their level of stage presence and
literary prodigy was something that I
didn&#39;t think I could ever achieve but I
was too naive at the time to really care
what was a more immediate issue it for
me was the fact that it wasn&#39;t enough to
want to be a poet in my mind poetry and
writing were tasks were things that only
people with privilege and gifts could do
and this is especially true because I
came from a first generation immigrant
family where my parents constantly told
me not to pursue the arts because they
were deemed impractical nevertheless the
date of the performance eventually came
and I found myself on stage reminding
myself to focus on delivering the poem
I&#39;d written I spoke at length about the
lack of asian-americans in Hollywood and
later
that night I found out that I had been
named the New York City youth poet
laureate for the year it was incredible
standing alongside mahogany all brown
ocean Vong and so many other renowned
poets joined by our mutual passion for
poetry and literature it&#39;s perhaps for
this reason why at poetry competitions
poets are always told to gain an
intimate relationship with their
audience
poetry is simply one of those art forms
that benefit immensely from being able
to express yourself through your
connection with an audience it&#39;s for
this reason as well that so many
different themes such as trauma
abandonment
and life-altering decisions are often
most poignant in poems as a youth poet
laureate I discovered that poetry can
bring so much more than just literary
and artistic merit to one&#39;s life
according to the Yale Center for
emotional intelligence there&#39;s actually
a statistically significant positive
correlation between conscientiousness
emotional intelligence and academic
success even so emotional intelligence
isn&#39;t something that&#39;s taught in schools
and it&#39;s extremely underdeveloped in a
lot of students having worked with
Facebook&#39;s inspire ed program for the
past year I&#39;ve also learned a lot about
the importance of incorporating empathy
and emotional intelligence into one&#39;s
education and I found that while poetry
may not be a direct path towards
developing empathy it&#39;s important to
understand how to utilize emotions both
in artistic usage as well as in
communication being able to express
yourself and to be able to engage others
in a conversation that is a true power
of poetry thank you
[Applause]
