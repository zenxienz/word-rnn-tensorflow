at night I see qualified didn&#39;t set the
meter up just for this event so much to
the pure 40 cents if you can start by
telling a little bit about me of my
relationship with rugby I find rugby at
the age of 13 and there&#39;s a slightly
problematic child at school the sounds a
little bit mischievous would be probably
an understatement
but fortunately I have a wonderful wife
speedy teacher decided one day that my
mysterious behavior was suddenly turning
to a rugby game and I would become the
school captain but over the next five
years and while she was very successful
I managed to capture a number of
different teams
I did my coaching qualifications being
the youngest coach in the country to
qualify and I had landed a job the age
of 19 with Rugby Football Union in the
department probably the youngest person
there
sorry so I&#39;d love directly there weren&#39;t
many weeks where I didn&#39;t spend at least
three days in some form of rookie
activity but over the next five years in
the past five years of my life I&#39;ve
become a sociology and I&#39;ve looked at
the problems of sports and over that
time I&#39;m seeing all these different
issues and my interest primarily come
from being an openly gay man and reading
lots of academic literature saying that
I should find it as a hostile and
homophobic environment must be beaten
and bullied and issued terrible and that
wasn&#39;t my experience in fact it was very
positive I was open against my teammates
I was open together but we thought were
you in a hyper macho sport and I had no
problems but I did find a problem and it
was in Germany concussion in rugby and
being a member of the England rugby
football schools Union I was in a unique
position seeing this as an issue so
rugby in schools at present we find that
it&#39;s currently played by about 77
percent of schools for boys but only 44
percent 46 percent for girls
so we&#39;ve got this difference from white
but more concerning for me quite
alarming in fact we find that 83% CIL&#39;s
made rugby compulsively footballs they
have no choice they
and even more worried is that 11% the
school if a parent says I don&#39;t want my
child to play contact with me will take
disciplinary action and that increases
21% for the charge so we can see we&#39;ve
got the situation where a large number
of schools a plain contact berkley if
they decide that they want to opt out of
this for lots of stores will take
disciplinary action because they and
this really worried me the most people
say well why rugby why are you picking
on rugby what&#39;s your problem with rugby
well personally I love I thought was
regretful but we asked heads of PE
because they&#39;re the best people in in
the field to understand the risks of
sports and these are their top risks
sports that they deliver in schools
across England from south of 300
secondary schools which is about 10
percent of the national population
bottom we have skier in athletics
gymnastics basketball netball and hockey
all below 10% so very few small say this
is their highest risk activity football
comes in at 17 with the same something
it&#39;s the highest risk activity
trampoline means 30% and that doesn&#39;t
surprise many when our trainers a PE
teacher I have to go on a special
qualification learning how to put
trampolines up and down because of the
risks that are associated for that but
what really stood out to me is sixty
percent of schools recognized brophy as
their highest risk activity that they
deliver but the difference between
trampoline indirectly is the
qualifications so to teach companying
and half of your qualification you have
to read out every three years and that&#39;s
compulsory no install run is showing the
depth but to deliver rugby you have to
have nothing nothing at school you can
never watch the sport and then suddenly
becoming into a PE lesson as a teacher
and told you&#39;re going to deliver contact
absolutely find by there are no replies
but of course requirements and things
sometimes that might not be reality so
we wanted to know what the reality was
so we we did a survey of schools in
Oxfordshire what qualifications the
teachers have and we found that 38% of
coaching qualification so 3/5 have no
qualification this could be historic as
well
this isn&#39;t last three years the last
five years it&#39;s gonna be 25 years ago
the game has changed considerably since
then for renovating at slightly lower
around 26% and then the next two that
were talked about is the head coach
training and this is concussion
concussions a big problem that we are
starting to recognize and small and
hopefully willing practice with a mentor
are things as well we&#39;ve said a big jump
in the number of people don&#39;t concussion
training but it&#39;s still very low and
it&#39;s increased more in the state school
sector than in the independent school
sector but it&#39;s still not good enough
so why is the risk of rugby you might
say well great but what&#39;s the problem
the rise of study of schools work week
in Northern Ireland which is the most
recent injury monitoring study in this
war find over a season an 825 players
there were 426 injuries which 38%
received at the least one injury of the
season
so these could be anything these two big
bumps and bruises but what we found was
63% of these are in the tackle and 49%
of injuries will climb over 28 days
awakens water so most of these injuries
aren&#39;t bumps or bruises these are severe
problems this week on telling I&#39;ve had
lots of debate of people and they&#39;re
saying but we removed tackling we&#39;re
just contributing to the obesity problem
but surely 49 percent of young people
are at was for 28 or most days that&#39;s
contributing to physical activity and
then 10%
anyone working passions in America needs
to call it Mars traumatic brain injury
for a reason
now it rugby&#39;s again for shapes and
sizes are not the smallest guy in the
world and lots of sports on college
stroke but we also found that it was the
larger gentleman that plays his primary
ones that were at the greatest risk so
in terms of concussion we can see rugby
has an eight fold over American football
I&#39;m sure lots of us have sinned issues
that around American football from the
United States many of you may have watch
the the concussion thermal world snip
recently as well and then of course says
the tragic story of Benjamin Robinson
Benjamin was a fourteen-year-old
schoolboy in Northern Ireland who died
whilst playing that bit from a condition
called second impact syndrome I&#39;ve asked
that you all go and read that press ask
was around it especially with his mother
Karen she watched her son live role in
the back of his head on the ground after
she tried number of times to get off the
pitch in fact the referee called her a
prima donna so what other things are
caused by this and of course concussions
a big problem and what are the outcomes
of that we can see post-concussive
syndrome which is concussive syndrome
it&#39;s the symptoms prolonged over a long
time there&#39;s chronic toxic
encephalopathy which has been the regime
that&#39;s received lots of attention
recently which is a neurodegenerative
disease but we can also see there&#39;s an
increased chance of welfare payments
dementia outsider&#39;s disability pensions
there&#39;s lower education achievement
there psychiatric inpatient admissions
are increased as a result of one
concussion under the age of 26 years and
then of course
dying younger in fact this week there
was never serious about repairs on a
whole host of health problems they were
worse off than the general
population will burn me the exception of
diabetes so what has been the message
that we&#39;ve been here and of course we&#39;ve
been we&#39;ve been fighting this battle
tackling in these schools won&#39;t be
coming for 18 months now and what we
hear is people trying to confuse the
message conceal things conflate the
message delay distract and deflect and
this is what they say to us they&#39;re
pulling for a battle drug bill while no
we&#39;re not we&#39;re calling on about
tackling in schools PA they&#39;re not
reporting the research the Rugby
Football Union has stacks and stacks of
studies which is not being released at
present the dates they have the last
piece of days they reported it&#39;s from
2013 nearly five years ago rugby is good
for you but they&#39;ve not presented any
evidence to suggest that and in fact the
studies are suggesting the opposite we
just need more evidence and this delays
the process we&#39;ve not brought that
little piece of evidence from that
specific area but of course the evidence
from all other areas that suggested only
has a high risk of injury than other
team sports of course there won&#39;t be
safe initiative which has recently been
removed from even work these website
because of some false information that
they were sharing and then finally they
deflect the problem it&#39;s not Irish it
schools are responsible for their
curriculums
we can&#39;t wait them out so what can we do
to reduce the risk of rugby and the
injuries of concussion and so on so at
the top of this of the hierarchy risk
you may have seen this if everyone&#39;s got
a background in health and safety if
we&#39;re using a ladder what I&#39;m do is we
try and reduce the risk as much as the
caps and as we go down the most
effective way of reducing the risk would
be removing the game take the risk away
completely the next one will be
replacing the tap with something else
the next one would be refining the
tapping technique
next with the Education and regulation
we finally will be strong cats now right
we&#39;ve got the human all work realties
looked at this from the reverse arctic
so first of all that they recognize that
how mates and from perhaps were
ineffective that prevents injury and
concussion next they looked at education
of the hex program by essentially by the
time that we recognize indistinct us
they&#39;re already injured they&#39;re already
damaged so it&#39;s the tertiary care
focused we actually don&#39;t evaluate these
these things currently they&#39;re nice time
to look at tapri technique modifications
and strengthen condition for which there
is no evidence to suggest will work if
we know that the best trained tacklers
they also have the highest risk of
injury because their borrowing
performance over something so what we&#39;re
calling for is replacing that tackle
with something else and there is
evidence to suggest when you remove that
contact I mean there&#39;s a three-fold
reduction of concussion so this is what
we should be focusing on now I believe
if the rugby is a great sport but I
don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a swarm of physical
education tools I don&#39;t want to see more
P lessons like this
