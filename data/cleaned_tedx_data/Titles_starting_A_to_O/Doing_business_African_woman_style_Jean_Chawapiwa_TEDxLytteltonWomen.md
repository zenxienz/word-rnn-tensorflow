my experience of doing business in
Africa has been about working with
amazing women
it&#39;s about sisterhood it&#39;s about sharing
and caring it&#39;s about lifting each other
up when things are not going well it&#39;s
about who won&#39;t - that humanity for
others it&#39;s that almost that you&#39;re
feeling that we get i think it&#39;s magical
so a lot of people will say well it&#39;s
not unique to Africa but it&#39;s Africa
that we&#39;re talking about and I think the
elements of it that are very much about
Africa women on this continent have been
gathering to do business since time
we&#39;ve been getting together to share
ideas and we&#39;ve almost been hustling to
make sure that we&#39;re looking after our
children and me making ends meet these
days women are meeting and gathering
with a new intent to do business we&#39;re
no longer happy to start small
businesses and have our businesses stay
small we really want to make sure that
we make an impact on this continent that
is ours - so I attend a monthly women&#39;s
meeting I&#39;m very honored to be included
in this gathering of business women
these are businesswomen that are turning
over multi-million rands Priya some of
them I&#39;m turning over multi-million
dollar worth of businesses they gather
with an intent to support each other
so these meetings I actually put
together under the slogan moving further
together the meeting starts with the
women sharing around the table they talk
about business personal as well as
family it&#39;s a holistic approach to
looking at you and how you run your
business
the women share their successes and
their challenges and we look at new
opportunities at one of these meetings I
did my share and as part of my share I
also talked about a business opportunity
that had happened me and two other women
business owners had come together and we
started a business so we hadn&#39;t just
talked about starting the business we&#39;d
actually done the strategy we&#39;d done the
inevitable what&#39;s up groups to actually
make sure that we&#39;re talking on a
regular basis and whit&#39;s registered the
business so I talked about the business
opportunity the opportunity actually
came out of being in matchmaking
meetings with corporates and we&#39;d heard
the corporates on one side talk about
the challenges they had about meeting
business owners and we had the women
business owners on the other side
talking about the challenges they had
and we decided there&#39;s a business
opportunity in this so we put together a
business anyway I shared this with the
group and the meeting went on a few
weeks later I was in my office
juggling meetings and reports as we do
and my phone rang I answered the phone
it was from one of the ladies from from
the group she hadn&#39;t called me before
even though we knew each other from the
group and we&#39;d met in the group I&#39;d
never received a call from her before
so we talked once the pleasantries were
done she told me that she had some money
to invest in our business
I was actually quite emotional and
surprised this was really about
sisterhood not only about somebody
listening to you and saying this is a
great idea but she then said okay here&#39;s
some funding this is a really great idea
move ahead with it for me that&#39;s part of
the narrative of the sisterhood that we
had in Africa we&#39;re not just saying I
support you but we do the physical
support that often goes with it
so after the paperwork was drawn and the
money was then deposited into the
account we decided that we would employ
a woman business owner an IT expert to
actually develop the app so therefore
almost completing the circle of
sisterhood in business and I don&#39;t think
this story is rare I think there&#39;s a lot
of this happening and I&#39;m seeing it more
and more that women we&#39;re not just
getting together anymore to just talk
and be nice but we&#39;re actually talking
business I can give you quite a few more
examples of the sisterhood get that
happening around us so we talked about
women gathering I also sit on the board
of an organization that trains on
entrepreneurship the organization is a
global organization I sit on the Africa
board and they teach financial literacy
and entrepreneurship and work readiness
to youth actually teaching youth in work
to look at the entrepreneurial ideas
around them in the environments and
putting them into projects and in a safe
environment being able to develop those
projects each year we have a Company of
the Year awards for this and what we&#39;re
finding is that more and more girls are
coming through in these teams in 2016 of
all the teams that came through
the 16 countries representing Africa 76%
of the teams were girls and these girls
are articulate they&#39;re savvy they&#39;re
coming through with really smart ideas I
think we need to know this as women
entrepreneurs and as adults because
these are the entrepreneurs that we&#39;re
going to be handing the baton over to
and some of these projects are really
amazing so one of the most memorable
projects for me in 2016 was another girl
team they&#39;d actually come up with a tee
that had been that they&#39;d beautifully
packaged and beautifully branded and the
tee helps with menstruation pain when I
asked the girls how they came up with
this idea one of the girls said her
grandmother had told her about this leaf
that they used to pull out in the
village where she lives crush it and
then put hot water in and then they
would drink it and it helped her
administration pain that&#39;s indigenous
knowledge meeting entrepreneurship
learning looking back a little bit I
used to work at the CSIR and one of my
favorite projects at the CSIR was when
we worked on IKS knowledge indigenous
indigenous knowledge systems the IKS
practitioners were predominantly females
I was amazed at how they came together
they didn&#39;t talk about who born - they
practiced it in everything they did they
were willingness to share their
knowledge and actually allowed the
Science Institute
to take that knowledge and put it into
modern-day science was amazing to me
what it taught me was that we had this
amazing knowledge on this continent we
could bring it into modern-day times and
it provided the key to our prosperity
and often we don&#39;t realize how much it
does that
and all of us have been given some of
these keys to knowledge often by parents
my mother and grandmother were very
entrepreneurial even from the way they
taught us how to work in the kitchen and
cook amazing meals or the way they
helped us to make our homes places of
absolute nurturing and of course the
knowledge they passed on in how we
raised our children is amazing and I
think a lot of that information to
knowledge we need to think about when
we&#39;re doing business a lot of it is
solutions to today&#39;s issues and today&#39;s
problems that we need to look at so I
also am involved with an organization
that identifies registers and certifies
women owns businesses we help these
women to meet the marketplace corporate
members the idea of the meetings is not
just to get together and talk but to
actually make sure that these women can
sell to the corporate the businesses
that register with us a small medium and
large they have opportunities to
actually sit and have matchmaking
meetings with the corporates so for
those who certify their businesses and
we&#39;ve got currently got 55 companies
that have certified their businesses
from the database of 700 companies the
55 have an opportunity four times a year
to have matchmaking sessions with the
corporates in these matchmaking sessions
they actually have an option an
opportunity to not only sell their
business to the corporates but more
importantly to listen to the
opportunities listen to the challenges
that the corporates are having and that
allows them to go away again and
innovate
this has been very successful and we&#39;ve
learnt a lot from these so one of the
things that&#39;s been happening with this
group of women is that they becoming a
community they&#39;re mentoring and coaching
each other and more than that they&#39;re
actually buying from each other products
and professional services so we&#39;re
having an inner circle of people that
realize that they can work together and
help each other to do well in business
beyond this these women are
collaborating naturally I have a number
of examples of some of the collaboration
that&#39;s actually going on within the
network and there&#39;s too many of them to
me to give you a lot of them so I just
want to give you a sample of some of the
collaboration that&#39;s going on so for
example we have a company that&#39;s does
strategy and processes
that&#39;s partnered with a legal firm and
they actually do running workshops to
help businesses to understand the new
information Protection Act we&#39;ve got
another company that does facilities
management a very large facilities
management company that&#39;s partnering
with a company that does manufacturing
of products cleaning products and
they&#39;ve realized that working together
they can actually approach clients and
be in a better position to negotiate
larger contracts we&#39;ve got two ladies
that met at one of our matchmaking
sessions both in service health services
Perdition health services the next day
they put together a proposal to supply
health services to one of the clients
it&#39;s those opportunities where they get
together and instead of seeing each
other as competition they see that
collaboration opens up new opportunities
and new doors to move forward we have
another two companies both in security
management both in different cities
doing very well and two cities they came
together at the matchmaking session and
decided that they would collaborate
grow their businesses beyond the borders
so collaboration is working for all of
us but what these women are doing
they&#39;re also reducing risk they working
together on their terms testing the
market testing how they can actually
work together and looking at new
opportunities what we know for sure is
that the corporates out there want to do
business with companies that can take on
larger and larger contracts and in most
cases the women business owners tend to
be either solopreneurs or SMEs what
we&#39;re finding is by linking in with the
women who are doing well and creating
much larger companies we can actually
bring these companies together to form
stronger partnerships so we know for
certain that the global economy is worth
about 86 trillion dollars of that 86
trillion dollars apparently women impact
about 20 trillion dollars in spend yet
we only get 1% of consumer purchasing
from the large corporates and government
and it&#39;s not because women are not
creating businesses up to 39 percent of
the world&#39;s small businesses privately
owned businesses a woman owned so we&#39;re
there we&#39;re creating businesses we&#39;re
doing our best to scale our businesses
but yet we&#39;re not getting the larger and
larger contracts so we talked about
collaboration we&#39;ve talked about
sisterhood we&#39;ve talked about how women
are coming together to do more we want
to make sure that women get together to
get a larger slice of that cake that
eighty six trillion dollar cake that&#39;s
out there we know for certain that it&#39;s
been shared by the male businesses and
we get the crumbs and often we&#39;re left
to fight over the crumbs but what we
need to do is to be more aware that
there are opportunities out there where
we can actually create new businesses
I think women should be looking at the
opportunities that we have on the whole
continent and creating businesses that
disrupt looking at the opportunities
that we have we have so many problems on
the continent and we can find some of
the solutions to those problems so how
do we do that we basically make sure
that we use the magic in our sisterhood
we keep collaborating we keep sharing
ideas to make sure that we can all move
forward together because I really
believe that we owe it to the people and
especially the young entrepreneurs that
are coming up behind us thank you
