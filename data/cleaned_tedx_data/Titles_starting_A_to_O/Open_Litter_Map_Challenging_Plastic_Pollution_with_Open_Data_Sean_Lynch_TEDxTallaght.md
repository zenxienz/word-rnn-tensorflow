we see it every day
litter is so common that all you have to
do is walk outside no matter where you
are you will be able to find a large
variety of degrading states of some of
the trillions of cigarette butts plastic
bottles bits of broken glass or maybe if
you&#39;re really unlucky some use needles
or dirty nappies all of which I&#39;ve been
documenting regularly because I&#39;ve got
one of these a data collector if you
turn your location services on and take
a photo
well that photo is geotagged I can tell
you exactly where and when you took that
photo if you send me a bunch of photos I
can use them to make maps tell stories
solve different problems and ask new
questions so let&#39;s take a look at a map
this is a map of litter in Galway what
you can see here is an Android and an
iPhone and although they&#39;re taking
photos of the same litter the iPhone
will map litter continuously
in red whereas the Android will tend to
cluster 20 or so photos at a time
because of its restricted temporal
revisit frequency when I walk down the
street and I see all of this disgusting
crap polluting our only habitable planet
that potentially hundreds of billions of
people have to live on after us really
sorta depresses me actually especially
because a lot of this stuff is making
its way into the ocean where it becomes
far more damaging I&#39;d like to suggest
that littering is just as serious and
urgent and requires just as immediate
other of our response as climate change
if you take a couple of these cigarette
butts and pop them into a glass or a jar
of water you get some interesting
results poison if you take this water
and multiply it by the trillions of
cigarette butts that are dropped around
the world every year you&#39;ve got a rough
idea of the
fact that smoking letter has on our
water which everything needs to survive
what&#39;s also interesting here is that
you&#39;ll notice these spots well they&#39;re
all at the bottom and they&#39;re made to
sink they do this by design you&#39;ll
rarely see a cigarette boat floating
around in the river because if you did
people might start giving out about them
it would not be nice to make things even
more interesting this cities that we
live on are actually designed to
facilitate what I call the illusion of
urban cleaning storm drains and gutters
will transfer litter out of sight and
out of mind where it would begin its
journey to the ocean and along the way
different chemicals get released and by
you accumulated by different plants and
animals some of which we like to eat and
it&#39;s not just smoking-related litter
that has significant deleterious impacts
on the environment that we don&#39;t
understand or appreciate plastic that we
use everyday kills hundreds and
thousands of birds and marine mammals
every year dead whales have had entire
plastic bags pulled out of their
stomachs other whale sharks and basking
sharks that visit us here in Ireland
trap and accumulate sharp microplastics
birds have had plastic kills hundreds
and thousands of birds every year and by
the time a bird dies from plastic its
entire stomach is exploding with bits of
sharp plastics if you walk around any
beach or coastline in the world you&#39;ll
probably be able to find scenes like
this which was taken in Dublin
unfortunately this image was not geo
tagged so I can&#39;t map it and if you walk
around any beach or coastline in the
world and you don&#39;t find anything like
this
that&#39;s because somebody picked it up in
2010 it was estimated between 8 and 12
million tonnes of plastic made its way
to the ocean and by 2025 this is
expected to increase exponentially by
more than fourfold 270 million tons of
stick entering the ocean every year and
most much of this plastic hasn&#39;t even
started to degrade yet and break down
into micro plastics like these this was
taken an or and more county galway
around the corner from the Marine
Institute along the wild Atlantic way
much of the micro plastics that you can
find on any Beach or coastline in the
world at the moment are from the marine
litter in the ocean that&#39;s been
degrading for several decades now and
has had a chance to break down so if you
take the plastic that&#39;s gone in since
then and extrapolate into the future I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ve heard that by 2050 there
will be more plastic in the ocean than
fish well I&#39;m not looking forward to
finding out when there&#39;ll be more
plastic than sand or stars it looks like
we&#39;re getting there and it&#39;s not just
the oceans in the land that we&#39;ve
completely lettered space is completely
littered there are tens of thousands of
flecks of paint orbiting the earth at
tens of thousands of kilometers a second
with such life-threatening impact
potential that could end space missions
and important satellites that were
increasingly dependent on there was a
remote island phone in the Pacific
recently said to have thirty eight
million pieces of plastic on it this is
what all of our beaches and streets
would look like if we didn&#39;t clean them
up thankfully many people do clean them
up and I have to give huge credit and
thanks to the good people of clean
coasts and tidy towns who have done more
for my mental health than any doctor or
product ever will but I can&#39;t tell you
if things are getting better or worse
because we&#39;re not collecting any data we
need to start taking outer data
collectors and taking photos so to make
things more interesting I&#39;ve developed
open letter map it&#39;s a game like Pokemon
go for tidy towns by uploading photos of
litter to open letter map you can
automatically create maps like this that
are analyzed and free for anyone to
download for any purpose so we can
collectively take photos crowd-sourced
data and integrate it into the
educational system the political system
the legal system to stop plastic
entering the ocean the litter is
automatically spatially analyzed in
these boxes these are hexagonal by grids
and you can toggle litter by related
waste so this is by behavior so this is
looking at alcohol-related litter in
Cork at a 500 meter space or you might
be interested in a soft drink related
litter with a 25 meter hex for a
specific day in June all of this is
possible with open letter map after you
upload photos you must tag how much
litter you can see in each photo once
it&#39;s processed all of the maps and the
charts will update it&#39;s a game so you
can level up score points and compete in
multiple different leaderboards and this
is a great way to promote your business
ethics or visibility and acceptance with
the public you can see here that that
the data for Ireland and October 2017 is
quite low so what I would like everyone
to do right now is to take out your data
collectors
everybody please and hold them into the
air like this and imagine what we could
do if everyone started taking photos we
see it every day
so start taking photos thank you
you
