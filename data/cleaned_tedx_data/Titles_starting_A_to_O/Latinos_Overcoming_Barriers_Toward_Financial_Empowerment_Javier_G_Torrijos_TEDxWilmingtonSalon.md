when you come to this country and you
enter Manhattan at the base of the
Statue of Liberty there&#39;s a plaque that
reads give me your tired give me your
poor your huddled masses yearning to be
free the wretched refuse of your teeming
Shores send these the homeless
tempest-tossed to me I lift my lamp
beside the Golden Door there&#39;s from a
phrase a poem from Mr Lazarus and it has
a lot of meaning because that&#39;s who we
are
Americans immigrants from different
countries all over the world that made
this country so great and so strong from
the early days of the colonists who came
to this country and they fled
persecution because of their religious
beliefs to the latest waves of post 1965
immigrants from Central America and also
Asia fleeing violence they flee in
poverty looking for an opportunity here
but yet today they&#39;re being challenged
and we want to create walls but we want
to rescind the dreamers and daca act
what have we turned into America what
have we become we are a nation of
strength through our immigrants see
diversity is what makes this country so
strong diversity if you look at great
leaders men who have changed history who
have changed science like Albert
Einstein had Jewish German immigrant who
became a citizens here in this country
and developed the laws of the theory of
relativity and how we approach science a
day or the first u.s. women&#39;s Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright from
Czechoslovakia who became a citizen here
or how about the code one of the
cofounders of Google Sergey Brin Russian
became citizen here they impact the
lives here we are a much greater and
stronger nation because we are a land of
immigrants and we can never forget that
and I want to thank also the
borinqueneers the 65th infantry who
finally in 2016 received the
Congressional Medal of Honor they were
discriminated they were set aside but
yet they gave their lives and they
served in three US Wars all Puerto Rican
and we had one of them here in Delaware
Manuel vyasadeva&#39;s who we should be very
proud of that thank you I want to share
with you my personal life story my
family&#39;s story see I have two young boys
I&#39;m very proud of them one of them is a
medical doctor and he serves in the US
Army finished his last year residency he
was able to go to some of the finest
universities here in his country Johns
Hopkins University as well as Mount Zion
and Manhattan study medicine and the
second one my youngest at Carnegie
Mellon who now later went on to be a
construction manager building beautiful
hometown in southern Delaware I&#39;m
extremely proud of them but the only
reason that was possible is because of
their grandfather my father their family
the sacrifices that they paid to come to
this country you see life wasn&#39;t easy
for my father he struggled he had a
difficult time as a young man he worked
in sugarcane plantations and if I&#39;m sure
none of you working to shoot Kim
plantation
if you ever worked they would tell me
the stories we had to wear long sleeves
as a little kid eight nine years old
because the Lee&#39;s would cut his hands
but he had to support his two sisters
and his mother and when he grew up
finally lefty Sen donor gave him an old
mule that was his parting gift in the
40s and the 50s there was love you
Lancia between the Conservatives the
haves and the Liberals to have-nots
it was an agricultural economy either
you had money or you didn&#39;t there was
really no middle class and my father
was just a poor man looking for
opportunities and lobular Lancia took
hundreds of thousands of lives in
America I&#39;d rather in in Colombia and
we&#39;re still seeing those effects today
but thank God he was almost set before a
firing squad and his life was spared and
he even tried to basically look for
opportunities in Colombia as a pioneer
in the Amazon jungle lost two daughters
because he didn&#39;t have access to health
care I never knew those two sisters of
mine but was interesting that the
parents sacrifice equals the children&#39;s
future he sacrificed and saved enough
money to come to America because he
heard about this great country of
opportunity a land of opportunity and he
came to this country and he set aside
here and he decided finally a year later
in 1964 when he came here year later in
1965 he brought his family we moved to
Brooklyn New York and we were it was
something tremendous for the family a
great opportunity we lived in a
second-floor apartment at that time six
of us by the time we left the nine of us
and two bedrooms one bathroom we shared
I remember coming home from church and
turning on the lights and my mother
would yell Matt Vanessa cucarachas kill
those cockroaches there was thousands of
them and we chased them and we kill as
many as we possibly can see at Christmas
time my father I could remembers given
me a little match back part because
that&#39;s all he could afford that&#39;s all
I didn&#39;t have all the technology the
gifts and all the things you get from
your uncles and aunts and so forth
that&#39;s all he could afford but his son
said son Merry Christmas
is all I can give you but that left an
impression in my mind that it carried on
to my children that they could honor
their parents see Latinos we love our
families we religious and we&#39;re hard
workers and we&#39;re extremely loyal and
that&#39;s why when you hear about today
about your immigrants and you hear these
families and
they suffered to come across the border
and they&#39;re trying to make their lives
matter here make a difference it reminds
me of them we face many barriers today I
remember as a little child going to the
hospital or the doctor&#39;s office and my
mother suffered from umarete arthritis
and she the day she died she was in a
wheelchair
it&#39;s a crippling disease affects your
joint your knees everything you can
barely walk and the only reason I stood
up and kept standing has a young child
was because I had to interpret for my
mother as they injected her with these
long goal shots into her joints the
nurse would turn to me and she said &#39;i
hope are you okay son are you okay and I
said as white as ghost yes mom I&#39;m okay
that still happens today in America
where Latinos don&#39;t have access the
language don&#39;t have access to health
care because of that barrier or when
you&#39;re a young child and you&#39;re taught
by your parents son when I talk to you
don&#39;t look at me you look down with
respect see Papa see my mom so you send
you what I see
but today they look at you and say look
at me when I&#39;m talking to you that&#39;s
disrespectful you have to understand our
culture who we are what we wear who we
are we should be able to accept our
culture but those are barriers that are
created sometimes in we as Latino
sometimes aren&#39;t understood or Huggy
were kissing we love each other I
remembered we had a community
conversation in southern Delaware and
this young man went to the doctor&#39;s talk
about trust relationships and they went
to the doctor&#39;s office and he was
hurting with toothache and he said
porfavor please and his broken nation
can you help me that receptionist please
take a seat
he waited all day long so the very end
when they were getting ready to close
reception to ask how can I help you
lost that trust we suffered through a
poverty of cycle see when you&#39;re poor
when I was growing up in Brooklyn you
know New York my toys were a popsicle
stick with the other boys racing him
down the gutter when they turned a fire
hydrant on or when they rained or we
made our own guns with a wooden stick
and a rubber band that was clipped at
the very end we stretched it I had a
clothespin
hanger and then we put pop sticks caps
at the end and we were shooted at each
other that&#39;s the safest toy but that&#39;s
what we did that&#39;s what we had but when
it comes to a choice a young man that he
asked when he grows up and he has to
decide where did they go to college or
feed his family and go work as what the
choice is pretty easy because he decides
the supported family rather to get a
college education and then that cycle of
poverty and that mentality still exists
in our community and we need to be able
to break that we need to be able to
provide those wraparound services
programs such as Stand By Me that
empowers stand by me Spano that have
individuals that can reach out to these
families and provide them with home
ownership preparing for college give
those individuals opportunities
resources that are much needed becomes a
sense of hopelessness and despair and
thank God for my family sacrifice that I
was able to avoid that see when I was
growing up in New York she I remember
being asked do you want to join a gang
or going to school and ducking because
bullets are flying in the neighborhood
or being held down with a switchblade
because they&#39;re stealing the very last
toy that you had that was my life I
understood what that was
financial empowerment 2014 we had our
first Latino summit here in Delaware and
we hear many Latinos who attended and
you heard those voices we did the train
by cell survey and the voices you heard
is we want good jobs we want a good
education we want equality we want to
contribute to society we don&#39;t want to
receive we want to give back we want
representation and it&#39;s so important and
you see what the graphic artist drew
here it draws a picture of hope a
picture of dream of vision and the Bible
says that my people perish because of
lack of vision Latinos do have vision
see financial empowerment allows you to
plan and dream for the future whereas
poverty makes you react to the present
and remind you of your past struggles
but if you take that dream seed like my
father&#39;s story and you basically make
the sacrifices for your children in
education it&#39;s a planned process that
it&#39;s a mindset that you have to change
to get out of poverty with the support
and help of organizations such as the
ones we have established here in
woman--the in the Latin American
community center or the one down south
lies pedasi in Delaware that have
coaches of Stand By Me is final
that gives us individuals opportunity
then you can cultivate that seed you
nourish it and it bears fruit
you
you
