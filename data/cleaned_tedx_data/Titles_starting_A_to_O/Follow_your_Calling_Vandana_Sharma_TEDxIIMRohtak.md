universe falls in love with the stubborn
heart when you really wish for something
it always comes true I totally believe
in this because this has happened with
me many times in June of 1999 I was in a
truck going from lay to Cargill this was
during the war and my truck was carrying
stores for the fighting troops around
this point I heard the first artillery
shell blast just a few hundred meters
away I cannot tell you what that
earth-shattering sound was like the
whole town seemed to be shaking the
truck in which I was sitting was shaking
I looked at the driver and he was as
shocked I was we both said nothing we
decided to keep going in that split
second I saw my entire life revolved in
my mind I said so many things to myself
like I&#39;ve just begun I&#39;ve seen nothing I
want to do so many things in life God
please keep me safe and I prayed saying
if I stay safe
I&#39;ll make this life worthwhile I live a
life without regrets I will go all in to
pursue all my dreams there were just a
moment since then there have been
several artillery shells several life
and death moments so many risks but
nothing ever shook me I was born on 23rd
of January and I share my birthday with
Netaji Subash Chandra Bose every year my
mother wishes me by saying happy
birthday Mary Netaji and the day I got
commissioned in the Army she
said you were always destined to be a
soldier Netaji uniform was my first
dream my first love and I&#39;m very happy
and glad that I could pursue it I&#39;ll
tell you a story
from when I was five years old we come
from a conservative yupi family which
which lives in a rural village my
parents and I we went visiting them
there men and women are treated
differently so unlike in my own house
where everyone eats together at my
grandparents place the men eat first
women cook serve and eat later I was
hungry I went to my mother who was also
in the kitchen and I said I want to eat
and she just gave me some water and said
go serve your father I did that I went I
left the water there and I said I want
to sit I want to eat before he could say
anything my grandfather said you eat
later with the ladies I immediately
asked both of them why is it that the
ladies have to cook serve you guys and
eat later
why is it that you eat first why is it
that I can&#39;t join you so when I asked so
many questions
my father said go get your plate come
sit eat with us
so my first fight for gender parity or a
seat at a table started when I was 5
years old I guess I just started asking
the right questions without fearing for
consequences and I continued to believe
that I was an equal or at times better
to make sure I work hard enough and
always be meritorious having said that
coming from a family from a rural
background our lives could have been
really different but for my parents
there was a
when relatives told my parents don&#39;t
educate the girls so much focus on the
boy the logic being we will not find
good guys to marry fair overqualified
I&#39;m glad my parents never paid a heat to
any such advice and they always believed
that Bieber had power with my brother my
brother has remained my idol and a
mentor all through our lives so not just
me I would say my entire family worked
hard they went all-in to make sure we
are who we are any short people play
basketball in this group awesome so I&#39;ll
tell you a story from when I was 13
I&#39;m 5 2 I wanted to play basketball and
everybody told me it&#39;s a game for tall
people you are wasting your time you&#39;ll
never do well better study I wanted to
play so I realized that I could do only
well at this game if I practiced long
distance shots the three-pointer shots
and that&#39;s exactly what I did every free
minute of my growing years was spent in
a basketball court shooting and
practicing 3-pointer shots
and with my 5 2 I managed to represent
the school Region three times at the
national meet consecutively for three
years when I joined the army Academy I
was captain of my basketball team and
not just that but I was very happy about
was that I was the only lady cadet with
lemon gentlemen cadet to represent the
Academy basketball team I think for a
small person that gave me a lot of joy
and what also makes me happy is my 12
year old son today plays basketball he
says he draws inspiration from his
mother and he&#39;s
shortlisted for state trials under 13 I
guess that&#39;s a very proud moment for me
so I joined army when I went to the
Academy from several thousand applicants
in the last 35 it was a proud moment I
remember going all in
I remember that Chennai heat mental
physical emotional rigor didn&#39;t feel
like anything because I was so driven I
loved it so much and I remember when my
parents came and saw me after six months
I look like this small dark tanned boy
they couldn&#39;t even recognize me
I cannot explain that feeling it was so
tremendous getting used to the curious
looks in uniform it was interesting it
took some time because in 1996 the
women&#39;s Commission was still very
nascent people often wondered and they
gave those looks wondering if I could be
as good as my male colleagues I wasn&#39;t
surprised as a male-dominated
organization I knew one thing if I run
hard if I shoot straight and I do my
professional work right which was
handling supply chain logistics for the
army I knew I would never be treated as
anything else but a lieutenant a captain
and a major and that&#39;s how it was in 98
I Wallen teared for Underdark posting
those years they never posted women to
high altitude unless they were Lin
tiered I loved Ladakh it was
breathtakingly beautiful peaceful and
there were no tourists in those days
unfortunately the Kargil war happened as
a young 22 year old for the first time I
experienced
loss of life lack of resources critical
deadlines not knowing what to do I
remember working day and night not
sleeping a wink keeping in mind that
they were those brave colleagues in
active combat in that whole inhospitable
terrain and us as a service organization
had to put in our best to support them
with all our might
those are the memories that I saw good
and youth both in the dark I had friends
who never came back from the war for the
work that I did then I found honorable
mentions in the history book in two
places one for doing extremely well
during the Kargil operations and two for
perhaps being the first woman officer to
have faced enemy firing in actual
operations I very humbly take those
experiences and continue to learn and
move so my 10 years with the army were
coming to an end and I started thinking
what next I had no idea what the
corporate world is like with nobody in
business in my family I didn&#39;t know what
people at the airports do with those
laptops and this is as of 2006 I could
shoot with all kinds of machine guns
throw grenades fire pistols but I didn&#39;t
know how to start a computer game of
throne
awesome so it was like wanting to know
what&#39;s behind that wall and I knew
nothing like Jon Snow so I decided that
I want a corporate career I landed an
offer with Wipro and I went to Bangalore
I went to a big city with chaos
traffic pollution noise technology
emails powerpoints exhales and a soldier
who had lived in a closed ecosystem was
making a small beginning with two little
boys I said I will give this 100% let&#39;s
see what this life is all about
my first assignment you know what it was
about it was about talking to fake
resume a candidates or employees and
interrogating and taking confessions
from them and if found guilty exiting
them out the typical stereotype that a
major from the Army is perhaps best
suited for a CBI like investigation I
guess I came a long way from there in
the last one decade since then I&#39;ve
headed learning and development people
practices consulting channel operations
several kind of rolls across MNC family
businesses ecommerce startups travel
startups I took a lot of risks with my
career and I can tell you 99 percent
paid off I found my mojo beyond the
routine nine to six jobs I volunteered
to run community programs women
empowerment cells fitness clubs when I
was at Myntra
I remember traveling to far-flung
delivery centers just to build a connect
and bring in the common culture all over
the country we grew from barely 200
people to about 6,000 people in the time
that I was heading people practices for
the supply chain all that mean from all
of that has been a great learning and
I&#39;ve learned so much by just taking
those risks I the message I want to give
you today is that do not work on
resuming I believe and I have always
worked on an epitaph how do we want to
be remembered I take a lot of joy in
spreading this message to young minds
and say live free I meant there a lot of
young startup founders I work with
college institutions to look beyond
academic excellence what I have learnt
is that always do what makes you happy
have a life beyond work move out of your
comfort zones I have traveled across the
world and a lot of times solo just to
fight my fears just to fight my
anxieties out of curiosity to see how
people live in other countries how
empowered of women are they similar
towards are they different and I&#39;ve made
friends I have learned so much and in
the bargain I have also been able to
test my support system back at home life
is a marathon do not sprint it take
risks I can tell you the best of
opportunities that I had always came
when no one else was willing to take
them when they was chaos when they were
critical deadlines I grabbed those
opportunities
and that&#39;s when I got recognized it&#39;s
very important to build a network of
family support and strength and
celebrate life celebrate your gender do
not be afraid live free my right has
been worth it
I&#39;ve always believed that fortune favors
the brave
good luck comes to those who work hard
and take risks I believe it&#39;s one life
make it worthwhile
I believe go all-in lock stock and
barrel grit and perseverance always pays
after two successful careers and 20
years of work I still believe there&#39;s so
much more to do and I continue to
believe I know nothing like my friend
Jon Snow and the journeys just started
and I have miles to go before I sleep
thank you so much
[Applause]
you
