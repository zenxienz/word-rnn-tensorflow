why is technology everywhere but nuts in
our garments who was standing this
morning in front of the Wardrobe and was
wondering what to wear today I see a lot
of hands but I also see a lot of
beautiful dressed people here in the
audience so it worked out very well
maybe there is a reason why people like
Steve Jobs
Elon Musk and Karl Lagerfeld&#39;s are
always wearing the same outfits but we
don&#39;t we asked ourselves questions like
is it going to rain
what&#39;s the weather gonna be like or do I
need to do am I going to travel and how
well all this kind of information we
easily find in our smartphone nowadays
we actually make these kinds of decision
based on a technology that is just there
right in the palm of our hands we
express our identity who we are or who
we want to be our IDs and how we feel
just to tag them phones but wait a
minute
wasn&#39;t that a fashion job to express our
identity fashion it&#39;s time to take up
and this this is something that I
realized three years ago when I was
graduating from fashion design school
actually we&#39;re in Rotterdam and let me
tell you a secret about fashion design
school the first you an ahall fierce
doesn&#39;t really matter of course you need
to be creative and then you work really
hard but you still can play around in
the ends
it all comes down to your graduation
projects your opus Magnum your calling
cards your PS the resistance everything
depends on it
imagine the stress one day I was so
stressed out that I couldn&#39;t move my
legs anymore actually I just couldn&#39;t
come out of bed anymore
first I freaked out but since I couldn&#39;t
move anyways I only could conclude that
I lost the connection with myself and
that made me wonder what if my pajamas
could help me right now and I can almost
hear your thinking like how Jam is gonna
help her well I got out of bed stress or
no stress but this time with a purpose I
devoted my graduation projects to
explore the connection between the brain
and fashion this resulted in the
creation of the fashion on brainwaves
collection I call it a primitive
prototype to expose on how emotions can
be presented in fashion by translating
the brain waves into morphing fashion
let&#39;s have a look at it
so I used in each AG device to capture
the brainwaves in real time and send
some wild sneeze through the app this is
the first outfit is called exaltation
and it reacts on how relaxed you are
feeling if you&#39;re not feeling relaxed
the color goes up and it forms a cocoon
around you so you&#39;re forced to first
come back to yourself and then to the
other world
you get real-time neurofeedback by the
movements of the color because of this
feedback you are much more self aware of
your inner state of relaxation or stress
and you are able to interact with it so
this was only the first step in
discovering the fashion on brainers
collection but if fashion has the
ambition to become the vessel to express
ourselves and the brain is the generator
of identity
shouldn&#39;t we connect these two in a much
more better way well ladies and
gentlemen give a warm applause for our
model Lara
[Applause]
with this outfit bright I was looking
for the ultimate connection between the
brain and fashion our brain color
defines who we are and that&#39;s precisely
what Brad is doing so each color is
connected to a certain brain wave it&#39;s
not only interesting to analyze the
colors but also the animations as you
can see I can see it flickering so I
think Clara is feeling very excited yes
okay but who wouldn&#39;t be with all all
the eyes on you so I can imagine that
you are very excited but I also can
imagine that you you and you may we
wouldn&#39;t like to wear this dress for
your next party because although you&#39;re
fully dressed
you can feel quite naked I mean how we
feel is very private and this dress
maybe even exposes more than we would do
on social media but that&#39;s not the point
what really matters is that we found a
way to expose the connection between
identity and our brain thank you very
much Larry
[Applause]
we also see practical tools are arising
for instance this one mind lights it&#39;s a
smart jewel and it gives you real-time
feedback and how concentrated you are
you actually can train your brain to
become more productive this type of
technology is already used today with IT
programmers this lamp tells our
colleagues if they can ask them a
question or nuts also perfect to
communicate with people who have autism
but also if you get in for surgery and
you&#39;re not able to say anything anymore
they still can see how you&#39;re feeling
and in the future a perfect tool to help
people with a concentration disorder now
with the Internet of Things we can even
go one step further because then you can
connect your brain interface garments to
everything for instance it can be linked
to your Spotify so the music is playing
depending on your mood it regulates the
temperature of your environment
depending on how you&#39;re feeling or it
shuts down your notifications when
you&#39;re focused or not this fashion on
brainwaves collection was for me the
start of an international roller coaster
a journey to discover new ways to
express ourselves to find a new way to
communicate but also to add an extra
function to our daily garments just by
combining fashion technology and science
pushing the boundaries of these three
worlds open a whole new world for me I
found so many new things that I also can
apply another domains and fields and
that&#39;s precisely what I&#39;ve been doing
now for the last years the last two
years I&#39;ve been working together with
small big companies with universities
to not only make this future visible and
tangible but also to get the latest
innovations to the markets we&#39;ve been
working for instance on nanotechnology
to make hydrophobic textiles with the
main goal to create garments that we
don&#39;t need to wash anymore we have been
working on printed garments with
flexible electronics we&#39;ve also been
creating new retail and design tools
with the implementation of virtual and
augmented reality so for me it&#39;s very
clear fashion and technology it opens up
a totally new world of possibilities and
it&#39;s evolving very fast and that brings
us back to the Wardrobe maybe not
tomorrow maybe not the day after but in
the near future we might have a wardrobe
not full of garments but only one just
like we have one smartphone one garments
who is able to change from form color
regulate zone temperature is always
clean and connected to your brain one
garment who rules them all and adapts
towards your needs and identity thank
you very much
