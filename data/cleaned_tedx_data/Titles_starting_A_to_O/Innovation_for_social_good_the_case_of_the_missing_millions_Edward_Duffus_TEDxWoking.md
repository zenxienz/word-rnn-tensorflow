this is Mira she&#39;s my daughter she&#39;s
lovely isn&#39;t she she&#39;s 18 months old
right now on second day after being born
she was given one of these
it&#39;s her birth certificate it&#39;s a legal
document which proves she exists in the
eyes of the law and the state we
recently moved from France to the UK and
it was essential that she had a birth
certificate in order to get one of these
a passport in order that she could
travel with us now you probably don&#39;t
think too much about having a birth
certificate you probably all have one
I imagine you take it all for granted
this is Ruby Ruby lives in Bangladesh
when Ruby 4 tried to go to school she
was denied access because she didn&#39;t
have a birth certificate fortunately her
mother helped to register
she got a birth certificate and she went
on to school where she thrived
fortunately at the age of 15 she came
home from school and her father was
waiting for her and he said that she
wouldn&#39;t go and continue in secondary
education she was going to get married
as is the tradition in Bangladesh and
was a financial para tip for the family
so what do you drew B do Ruby knew that
her birth certificate was a legal proof
of her age so together with some
supportive teachers she went to a local
government office where the local leader
told the parents of the implications of
child marriage she was underage she
couldn&#39;t get married thankfully the
result of having a birth certificate she
got out of that marriage went back to
school I&#39;m really happy to say that she
graduated at the age of 18 and is doing
really well so ruby was clearly very
courageous and her birth certificate
proving that she existed an illegal age
help to get out that situation
unfortunately that&#39;s not the same for
many many children in fact 290 million
children around the world under the age
of five do not have a birth certificate
that&#39;s 45 percent of children under the
age of five around the world without a
birth certificate it means that these
children do not have access to basic
services like health and education
without a birth certificate it means
that these children do not exist in the
eyes of the law and the state and are
therefore invisible to their state
they&#39;re therefore vulnerable to all
forms of abuse and neglect like child
marriage like Ruby or child labor the
situation is even worse for people on
the move like refugees and like
internally displaced people for those
children who don&#39;t have a birth
certificate they are the most vulnerable
in such situations because they don&#39;t
have access often to assistance and are
not able to cross borders
now I work for an organization called
plan international we&#39;re a global child
rights organization we&#39;re based our
international headquarters are just up
the road and we strive for a just world
for all children and equality for girls
and we have a dream of universal birth
registration universal birth
registration as the name implies is that
every boy and every girl around the
world has access to a birth certificate
so they can prove who they are and prove
their legal age that international we
believe that we should count every child
because every child counts so what&#39;s the
situation like on the ground so we&#39;ve
been helping girls and children like
Ruby in a number of countries I were
present in 71 countries around the world
and we working in birth registration for
some 20 years this gentleman is called
Simeon he works in the national office
and births and deaths in Sierra Leone
and I met him back in 2013 in in
Freetown and I&#39;ve been showing this
picture ever since I wonder what you see
in this picture or what I saw then and
what I still see now is frankly a
dysfunctional office this is the
National Archive and the papers on these
shelves are next to useless they serve
no purpose full function you couldn&#39;t
search there as records for
authenticated copy of a birth
certificate for example in fact the in
Sierra Leone the birth registration rate
is around 50% 50% is not bad for Africa
their African countries have a birth
registration rate of less than 10% so in
fact one could argue that the children
whose birth records appear on these
shelves in the National Archive they&#39;re
the lucky ones so what about the unlucky
ones and the ones who are not registered
so where are they well they are most
often in rural locations rural locations
where registration services can&#39;t get
down to them parents often have to take
travel long distances a great expense to
them to a district capital to register
their children that&#39;s very diff
often the process is very complex and
unclear so when they get there they have
a document they need it have to go back
and travel many times and often when
they when they finally make it the right
documents they&#39;re faced with corruption
is they have to pay over the odds as
well there&#39;s another interesting thing
that we noticed in Syria that is
although the birth registration rate is
50% the vaccination rate is over 90% so
what was happening was the young
children newborns were getting
vaccinated at a very early age the field
workers health workers were coming into
contact with them collecting details
about them including their birth details
but these were not being passed on to
the Civil Registration Department Civil
Registration Department is responsible
for the registration of births deaths
marriages and divorces so that point
back in 2013
I really felt we needed to help Simeon
and help civil registrar&#39;s like him
around the world and also extend out
birth registration services out to
communities and I knew as a technologist
we had the capability and the ability to
do so so we started exploring different
technological systems around the world
pretty key and low resource settings to
see what was out there and frankly I was
really disappointed with what we saw
particularly in low resource settings in
the developing world we saw systems that
were poorly designed did not reach out
to the rural communities very difficult
to use and in many cases countries would
treat the civil registration and the
systems as a one-off case so there&#39;d be
reinventing the wheel each country would
make its own system to respond to their
own needs but it wouldn&#39;t respond to
their needs yes so then we had somewhat
of a sort of Rica moment and thinking
about how we could help Simeon and all
these unregistered children we started
thinking about you know what if we could
do something for them and for me this is
the sort of innovation mantra what if we
could so what if we could create a
free system for all civil registrar&#39;s
around the world the systems which I
mentioned these are all systems that
governments have to buy a great expense
what if we could create a
standards-based system a system which is
based on at one set of standards which
is used across a number of countries
what if we could create a system which
was easy to use what if we could create
a system which made health systems civil
registration systems and national IT
systems interoperable to gain maximum
advantage from them so we were excited
by this we you know we create a greater
system we start talking to partners
about how we could do that
um I then started sharing the idea but I
was met with a with a disappointing
response and that was a lot of
negativity the responses were something
like how is your system going to respond
to the legal frameworks in country how
are you going to build a system which is
going to be secure enough how how is a
charity like plan international what&#39;s
the role of a charity to build systems
for governments than developing world so
far I would fail before we&#39;d even
started but then we try to spin this a
little bit and think well actually we&#39;re
being challenged but because we&#39;ve been
sharing our idea in an open agile way
actually we&#39;ll just take that feedback
and we&#39;ll build it build it into our
system so when we were challenged with
it wouldn&#39;t fit with legal situations in
countries we said well we&#39;ll build it
according to all the legal frameworks or
all the countries we know and future
legal frameworks as well when we were
challenged we couldn&#39;t make it secure
enough we decided well use best practice
state-of-the-art security protocols and
work with partners to ensure the systems
private data remains private and
confidential and we were challenged
about plans role well we just responded
while there are 290 million children
unregistered then we&#39;d make it our role
to create such a system and would make
it a reality
so we had a plan we would create open
CRVs open because it&#39;s built on open
standards and open source technology
CRVs which is Civil Registration and
vital statistics civil registration the
registration of births deaths marriages
and divorces and vital statistics are
the population data which you can create
from civil registration records I&#39;m
really pleased to say that in May this
year we scraped together a little bit of
money to start work on this because
we&#39;re the only ones who really believed
in it and we started building we put
some folks together including civil
registrar&#39;s and around the world in a
room and we gathered together the first
set of requirements and since May we&#39;ve
been building and two weeks ago and
really pleased to say we were
demonstrating a prototype of open CRVs
at the UN in Bangkok in front of a whole
number of countries from Asia in the
Pacific and the overwhelming response
was this is fantastic you&#39;re building
something which is going to be
revolutionary and you should keep going
which was fantastic so we&#39;re gonna give
you a sneak peak of what it actually
looks like as we&#39;re really proud of it
and we think it&#39;s a game-changer in in
the in the space of civil registration
and birth registration so I want to show
you three views this is the view of the
tablet application which is used by
field offices way down in the field so
this is facilitating birth registration
within the community whether the birth
takes place in a hospital a village
clinic or at home the field officer here
is they were equipped with this device
able to visit the community and when
I&#39;ve indicated on the left hand side
they&#39;re all the vaccinations which have
taken place so we integrate the civil
registration system with a health system
health system is saying these children
have been vaccinated and we&#39;re then able
to register those children locally this
is a view of a role in a district
registration office so this lady is a
certification clock and once the birth
registration has been validated
and registered an SMS gets sent out to
the local community to the parent
they&#39;re informed that the birth
certificate is ready to be collected the
parent comes shows their ID card and
receives their certificate so that
removes this these multiple journeys
that the parent has to make to and fro
from the community to the district
capital and finally this is the view of
the National Operations Manager somebody
like Simeon who has the role of
administering civil registration of
course Sierra Leone or now if you
compare this with what he had you know a
whole bunch of paper records that he
couldn&#39;t search now he has a means of
identifying hotspots of registration
capacity across Sierra Leone coverage
rates increasing the ones well before me
are in green in red those poor
performing areas so we can take
preventive action and actually be able
to do his job properly as a national
operations manager so it&#39;s early days
for us with open CRVs that we&#39;re really
we&#39;re really excited about what we&#39;ve
done thus far we have a long way to go
but we&#39;re motivated every day by
children like these who finally get
their birth certificate and we believe
truly believe that opens the obvious is
a game changer in this in this space so
we&#39;ve learnt a lot on this journey I&#39;ve
tried to pick out a few points along the
way and but every setback has in fact
encouraged us to work harder and we
believe in what we&#39;re doing and we&#39;ll
make it a reality maybe maybe just at
three points which I would share with
budding innovators out there first is to
not accept business as usual and
certainly as a challenge we came up with
many times secondly to challenge
orthodoxies now an orthodoxy is when
when you hear someone saying but it&#39;s
always been done like this that&#39;s a it&#39;s
a key moment when you should think
you&#39;re probably on the right path to
actually change and do something new and
different
and thirdly what I would say is if you
have a vision and we had a vision for
open CRVs if you have a vision
particularly one which has the potential
to change the lives of millions of
children then you know as the marketing
director of Nike once famously said just
do it thank you
[Applause]
