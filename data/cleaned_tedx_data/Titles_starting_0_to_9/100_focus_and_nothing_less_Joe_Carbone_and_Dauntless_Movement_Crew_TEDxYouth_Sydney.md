what is the difference between doing
attacks running a marathon or doing your
washing well a few things actually but
unless you want an unfinished tax return
an incomplete marathon or half-ass
washing job then you need to put in a
hundred percent this applies to
everything in parkour I&#39;m required to
put a hundred percent of myself into
every single role jump
flip or twist some muscles tense as I
grab hold of the rail others flex as I
reach for the landing whatever the
obstacle I know that I need to stay
focused and give it my all if you&#39;re
going to go jump off a rooftop you can&#39;t
hesitate you can&#39;t doubt yourself my
name is Joseph Carboni and I&#39;m a part of
DMC dauntless moving crew we&#39;re a stunt
team that has 20 core members combining
breakdancing martial arts acrobatics
tricking free running and parkour
together we teach over 300 students a
week in a variety of art forms that
require dedication passion but most
importantly focus we haven&#39;t always been
a full-time team we started out in the
streets of Fairfield in western Sydney
back then it was it was more of a hobby
you know would always go to trainer
places we like to call underground to
work in our flow or style faith would
park for the flips snake Park for the
jobs you know we never really trained
outside of Fairfield the acrobats would
teach the dancers how to flip and vice
versa you know we were kids just having
fun but training pushing ourselves
taking bigger and bigger jumps and every
forward teaches a new lesson about
gravity about different buildings and
services about our bodies our limits but
most importantly to always stay focused
now as you can imagine
our parents weren&#39;t big fans of what we
did or who wanted to become some of us
true inspiration from kung fu fighters
others from I don&#39;t know about you know
world-class dancers or movie stars but
to our parents and community we were
just a bunch of rowdy kids that liked to
jump off stuff despite this we stuck
together and we continued training we
got more and more creative until our
until our town was our playground like a
maze with endless possibilities from
there our team grew to almost 60 to 70
kids getting stopped by the police was
just an average day because they didn&#39;t
understand what we were doing and as you
could imagine a bunch of kids running
around the way we did we&#39;ve got quite a
few people upset after many letters from
the council we decided to sit down with
them and let them hear our story where
I&#39;m from kids don&#39;t really have a lot to
do after they finish school or people to
look up to so we kind of felt like it
was our job to be role models to all the
kids out there
trying to get them to stay active and
train was a whole other challenge we
didn&#39;t want other kids to follow in this
path so we decided to create a presence
within the community
Slattery in front of the TV was replaced
with hours of training that proved that
they were strong independent determined
and focused parkour is known around the
world from getting to a derby as fast
and as Florrie as possible but to us
it&#39;s about so much more it&#39;s not about
getting somewhere quick or learning a
cool trick it&#39;s about pushing yourself
but knowing your limits and now&#39;s the
same with our dream we never knew how
we&#39;re gonna get there we just got
creative and was only with extreme focus
and put in a hundred percent into every
single task whether it was big or small
that got us where we are today
so from getting in trouble by the cops
cm senior to around Australia teaching
in schools our skill and our knowledge
we perform worldwide in live stunt shows
and we just recently opened up our very
stunt chin so we may not be superheroes
or you know world-class dancers but
we&#39;re pretty close so I&#39;ve got a couple
guys backstage right now warming up and
stretching to give you guys a little
taste of our world so if you can put
your hands together and make some noise
