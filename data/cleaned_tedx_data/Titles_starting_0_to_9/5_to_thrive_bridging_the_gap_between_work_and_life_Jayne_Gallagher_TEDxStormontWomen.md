while ago I find myself in a rut a rut
that find me focusing on one thing in my
life work I&#39;m not saying I was immensely
stressed by work or not enjoying it far
from it I love my job
the people we work with and the work we
do but I find that my life has been
consistently taken out but with work
getting up getting dressed for work
traveling to work they even work
traveling home from work I&#39;m so consumed
unfortunately still in work that I find
I was getting home and reaching for the
mobile as we all do and checking for
work emails and a problem was forming I
was getting soaked assume didn&#39;t work
but I was widening the gap between work
and life and more worryingly I thought I
had very little else to talk about but
work when friends her family would ask
hi walls or what I was up to I find my
standard response was becoming good
lausanne works really really busy yeah
got lose on work work work work gets
there I know what else have been doing
but ya know Brooks Rita Daisy and I have
this overwhelming fear that I was
becoming boring I needed to bridge that
gap between work and life so where to
start
well realization is always a good one
but luckily for me I also have a helping
hand and a coach a person I have
complete admiration for and fierson
someone who is not afraid to challenge
me and ask me those questions that
perhaps of a friend or family rooted
member to do it they might be a little
scared by my reaction so I went to my
coach and I brought her my rut I said
I&#39;m struggling with work what did I do
sessions followed and between us we came
up with five to thrive if I could find
my five my five people my five actions
my five ideas that could help me get out
of the rut and bridge that gap between
work and life and a crazy thing happened
actually as soon as I realized so that I
can have five I felt reenergized
rejuvenated I couldn&#39;t wait to start
thinking about who or what my size might
be I&#39;m bear with me but this is
like a hairdryer remove it for me so for
a lot of you it could be a lightbulb
moment spark goes off and realization
hits well for me it&#39;s a hairdryer moment
so imagine hairdryer in one hand brush
and the other Brown the shape pretending
it wouldn&#39;t stay in trying to style my
hair I end up giving up but I find out
that this hand can&#39;t really do anything
on this hand is just using the hairdryer
so I find actually that I could use
these movements to contemplate and
occasionally I could actually crack
something that was really bothering me
so they are my hairdryer moments so my
five to thrive like people ideas or
actions that I could use to bridge that
gap and what if I was to be really
strategic about my five and deliberately
choose them mean let&#39;s face it we live
in a world where we&#39;re surrounded by
people and grits so why not choose five
grits that can help us with people ideas
or actions so to my five my first
friends and family
well I&#39;m grouping these as one because
it&#39;s my size after all but these people
are my constant and going through this
process of identifying who my five are
just showed that to me and it&#39;s
important that I make time for these
people so I offered to take my nieces
and nephews for overnight stays I take
my mum for shopping on the Saturday
morning I make time for date night with
my husband and I plan ahead to have
girls night sight even if it&#39;s weeks or
months in advance just to have them so
my first my friends and family so to my
second well it was terribly with this my
challenger the external input of a
person could be a colleague it could be
a coach but someone who&#39;s not afraid to
challenge me and ask me those awkward
questions and sometimes the input that a
coach can give or a challenger can give
can&#39;t be pretty baffling and bewildering
but just like those hairdryer moments
sometimes they give you that little
spark that&#39;s something that sticks it&#39;s
something that makes you think and for
me I&#39;m really lucky because I have more
than one challenger in my life they have
two I have my coach but I also have my
boss the man who challenged me to be
here tonight
and indeed the man who introduced me to
Kochi and for that I have to be very
grateful because the benefits that an
instant external input can bring or
terrific so two of my five two people
that are close to me but what if I was
to look to the periphery what if I was
to look to people that I don&#39;t actually
knew people that are of no immediate
proximity to me and that&#39;s face it why
can&#39;t we we are surrounded by people
whether we follow them on social media
whether we read about them in the news
read about them in in business books and
why not use these people to really see
if we can thrive to help them help to
ask them to help us to bridge the gap so
for my third I did just that I looked to
the periphery and I look to the world of
sport sportsmen and women completely
inspire me
I don&#39;t know dedication is fantastic and
I&#39;m particularly fond of Wimbledon in
2003 I was fortunate enough to actually
work in Wimbledon and it was the same
year that Roger Federer won his and
Wimbledon championship night to me Roger
Federer epitomizes everything a sports
person should be his performance is
fantastic and his comeback has been
quite extraordinary Roger Federer
recently said I believe that if you&#39;re
stuck in a hole and things aren&#39;t going
your well going your way you will get
stronger because everything in life is
this way and I can really relate to that
because when I&#39;m stuck in a rut it
turned to my five when I try to get them
to help me to be stronger and so to my
force all I look to actions running but
it&#39;s no surprise to know that exercise
is great for the soul it&#39;s a really good
activity to be doing to help with your
mental and your mental and your
well-being and for me it&#39;s something
that&#39;s actually reenergized my desire to
do it I was never a runner not even
really a jogger I think I decided like
I&#39;m a light jogger but when a friend of
mine recently asked me to help her or to
join her in a cage to 5k
I said yes I was terrified but I said
yes a night we are completely loveliness
we rightly the night last night running
in the cold
and it&#39;s such a thrill and someone I
know did say to me if you can go out and
run in the cold and the dark
it&#39;s amazing what your mind can do you
can find new approaches to do the
problems that you can help with I can
help with you tomorrow so that&#39;s my
fourth so my fists reflection reflecting
and things that have happened that have
been good and that have been bad asking
myself how would I do things again and
actually just being grateful for some
things so I recently watched a movie and
it was about a young man he had
inherited his father&#39;s ability to time
travel and he would go back every day
and he would relive the last day having
reflected on how he behaved so the
cashier at the coffee shop that morning
that he had dismissed because he was in
a rush he went back and he smiled and he
gave him a warm welcome the colleagues
that he had failed to acknowledge was
struggling with a piece of work he went
back and he helped and the sunshine that
was shining which he completely missed
because he was running between meetings
came back and he acknowledged us and
recognized and appreciated the sun
shining until he realized that he didn&#39;t
have to keep going back every day he
could reflect there and then I make
decisions to actually change his
behavior so there&#39;s my five my friends
and family my Challenger Roger Federer
which is quite easy on the eye as well
running and reflection and these five
taught me not only just to bridge that
gap and to get me out of the rut but
they also reboot and rebake &#39;end a lot
of my senses and got me onto the path of
thriving rather it down surviving you
know a lot of what I might say thirty
tonight could just assigned it like
complete common sense but if someone
said to me recently common sense is very
commonly not applied so ladies and
gentlemen I would just like to leave you
with the question that whatever you&#39;re
about to make be how would you bridge
that gap what are your five to thrive
thank you
[Applause]
