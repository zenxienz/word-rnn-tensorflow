to English and I would like to talk to
you about an interesting adventure that
Scott Santana is a marking and really
really far away from here in the city of
Chongqing in China this is the adventure
that now has a name is called the scene
Italian innovation base camp and and in
the next 20 minutes I would like to tell
you it bit what this initiative is about
and so this is a this is story that
started 10 years ago and it was a story
whose goal was to connect to our super a
Santana with the city the city of
Chongjin
in China the numbers of this adventure
are very interesting we are about to
start with six people on the ground
already present in in a district of
Chongqing coalition a two-year spiral
project completely funded by the Chinese
government with 1 million euros
equivalent and we have 400 square
kilometres to develop to help develop
and with connecting Italian science and
technology with Chinese Talent
this would not have been possible
without
working together with our Chinese
partners for ten years because it&#39;s
fundamental with China to develop the
right connections the right
understanding of the place before you
get anything out of results of
negotiation illusionism and the result
of the negotiation was incredible
this was a picture stolen taken in the
Great Hall of people with the recognized
electrical domain America standing next
to the actor the president of Chongqing
University and in the background you
have president such a mozzarella and
President Xi Jinping and that was the
setting of an unprecedented event for
squirrel suntan we signed this agreement
in front of two ministers to two
president and it was a very important
starting point for our soso fabrice 22nd
2017 is the starting point of the
project that would like to tell you
about but let me take a step back let me
tell you what what what what happened
this is a collaboration of three parties
the first partner is Scott&#39;s present and
of course you know Scott&#39;s present and
we are a special institution small
research oriented universities in Italy
that had been lucky enough good enough
to protect itself very very well on
international ranking for quality of our
research teaching and as you can see
today
for the quality of our students Johnson
University is a large University in much
much larger than us located in the city
of Chongjin in the heart of China vision
national hi-tech zone is a district
identified by the Chinese authorities as
a very interesting areas for for
development very strong scene for those
of you that like me the first time I
heard I need to go to Chuncheon this was
ten years ago I had to understand
exactly where the city is located the
geography of the city is incredible it&#39;s
very important to realize the the city
is a port only answer River and in a
very fast paced country like China is
the city&#39;s the municipality municipality
meaning it is one of the four cities
directly under control regime so gives
it a lot of autonomy from the regional
the regional government is the fastest
growing China plus 11% aware its GDP 30
millions of Italians of 30 millions of
inhabitants this means half of the
Italian population in the municipality
we are talking about a significant large
city a city that had a very interesting
history this was the hidden capital of
China during the war the a very
important center of manufacturing for
for the Chinese economy for the
reconstruction and for the the start of
China become a global power in one
faction from a hidden capital to a very
important center for what the Chinese
government is now calling the new tax
entered Silk Road and Tintin is now at
the center of the goest policies of the
Chinese government it&#39;s very important
to realize that while there are very
other many other important cities in
China
Chongqing had been designated as the
stop of the line the new train line that
connects the city of Duisburg in Germany
to to China
so from Duisburg to Chongqing and now
there is a direct train connection right
now only for for goodsoon but maybe in
the future for people there are recent
Italian journalist now that is taking
incredible adventure following the steps
of this of this train line and you can
realize that this is a fantastic
infrastructure that connects the city of
Chongjin with the rest of the world
bhishan if you think about Santini&#39;s you
have to think about a hand the palm of
the hand is where most of the people are
concentrated and then the fingers are
mantids that from the city go out into
into the valleys and between these two
fingers terraces the valley were the
city of mission is located the
environment is a little bit different
from from Jong Cheney you don&#39;t have
this fast pace metropoli that is growing
this nine hundred thousand inhabitants
place but you realize how fast this is
this is growing it&#39;s really growing even
more than the city self and
the the city has been a part of wider
plan called China torture problem that
tries to push technology-based growth
high-tech development in particular
areas of China and this is where our
senior Italian innovation base camp will
be will be located location matters you
can see here university town where the
the university of Chongqing has a main
building campus D we are located the
Galileo Institute is located here in
shopping bag and we have been here for
the last ten years were the headquarters
of the church in university located
there is there is a metro line that
connects everything with the downtown
Church in and the vision district is
this over here all this area shadow is
where the scene Italian base camp will
be will be located it will take
basically one hour to get to the to the
channel to the main airport of chunji of
course they&#39;re building a new airport
because being China you need to build a
new airport every now and then direct
connections with Rome interesting thing
about church in Rome is one of the two
European cities that have direct
connections to church in Helsinki and
Rome very strange very interesting this
is this is something very important to
keep in mind we do have a consulate
engine chain the Germans have a
consulate in Chengdu close by but still
not sunshine Italians have a first mover
advantage and this had been recognized
by our Chinese partners over there and
it&#39;s very very in
to keep in mind so what is the mission
of the Symington and innovation Basecamp
if the mission is to empower an open
innovation system that starts from the
area bhishan by strengthening the
connections between Italian science and
technology and local talent we need to
create opportunities for connections
there are three areas of activities that
of course are very close to the type of
activities that we conduct here it&#39;s got
some time first of all education we want
to create joint education programs
second research starting from joint
research initiatives and joint labs
hopefully in the era of specialization
of the various university partners and
then technology transfer an incubation
to get closer to the needs of the market
and hopefully to to take more downstream
the results of new science and
technology developments in indocin
Italian art what and this is very
important to understand what we are
trying to do is that sent an experience
in the city it&#39;s not good only for some
time we are trying to open our arms and
to embrace other Italian universities in
its adventure other research centers
other you know repellents pass a test
agency CNR and all the other proteins
potential partners and other
universities are approaching of seller
telling us you&#39;ve been in this city for
10 years you know people you know you
have
a great great access to local talent and
local investors and this is exactly the
scope of the project we want to identify
areas of excellence Italian area areas
of excellence that want to invest in
Chongqing we want to create the
connections with the local indigenous
technology identify the relevant ideas
that have a chance to develop and at
that point try to taste them in an
American Development Junction so the
idea here this is a little bit the hope
the dream but given the seed funding
that we have received from the Chinese
government
the idea is to tell our Italian
colleagues buy yourself a ticket get
yourself with the Chinese to do the
Chuncheon Airport we&#39;ll take it from
there you want to spend one day one week
one month explore an opportunity be here
for a conference engage into a
cooperation agreement we&#39;ll prepare the
ground for you and this is the this is
the hope that we will try to do with
this finance system so one provide
technology science base from SIA from
Santana Eaton University and touching
universities to develop interesting
research projects or teaching projects
matching the new ideas with vision and
the larger Church in industrial base
this new project we will should launch
and hopefully they will be interesting
also for for partners in the in the in
the VC
community year the disruptive Lacroix
depart the the project project
governance is structured around a team
in China that should look at this
project and work on the development on
the individual projects that are going
to be implemented so there is going to
be people on the ground that are doing
the background or work and preparing the
various dossier and it&#39;s very important
because as you can understand language
difficulties but also understanding of
certain technical terms or understanding
what kind of talent do we need it&#39;s very
it&#39;s very critically requires a lot of a
lot of work and then there is going to
be a team here in Italy that is going to
promote recommended like I&#39;m doing now
this idea of investing in a mission and
extending a new annual collaboration
with with the chin area it&#39;s a
comprehensive approach what we are
trying to do is really like accompany
all stages of development during this
two years of pilot it&#39;s an inclusive
approach as I said what we are looking
at what is it to you what we are looking
for is interested parties that are not
necessarily coming from Santana but
they&#39;re also coming from other
universities and research centers in
Italy one aspect that is very important
to keep in mind that this project is
very much consistent with the planning
of the regional and the national Chinese
authorities so right now there are many
other initiative this one has a very
strong institutional support in China
and this it&#39;s extremely it&#39;s extremely
important if we if you want
two things in in that area of China
something that something that we we can
showcase right now is the first project
that has already was it was a pilot
project but is entering in orientation
phase and is of course what project
started here as well Santana with
Professor Massimo Berger Moscow the
director of one of the engineering
Institute Sharon Santana and Maximus
team ambition is to develop the largest
augmented reality clay in China
. this is incredible this is a very
important project and the connections
are ready established by Massimo in the
city allows him an dance team to already
have an interesting based work within
the city in we used him as a as an
experiment so indeed this was a pilot
project also for us and it was very
interesting have so many interesting
stories about how the project developed
so we learn a lot in this working with
with this team and we&#39;re very grateful
to the grammatical for working with us
on the cyber sea basic physical system
project it is going to be the first one
to be implemented in in ambition so
there is this old Chinese saying
the best time to plant a tree was 20
years ago the second best time to plant
a tree is now so the idea being that
there is a lot of feeling we are late
okay we will missed an opportunity with
China this is not the case with which
anjing we have been there we have been
there and we have been planting this
seeds in the proper way 10 years ago so
it&#39;s time now to to embark on this
adventure and try to reach out to our
partners and to make good use of this
great opportunity that we we have
received so there are going to be many
opportunities not only for researchers
but for students this room is full of
Santana students you&#39;ve been coming to
chin chin very very frequently in the
past few years I invite you to consider
to them to take come and join me in my
next trip there are going to be plenty
of opportunities for a very exciting
project and I wish to have you on board
with that I thank you very much being a
team or to pretend see ona
