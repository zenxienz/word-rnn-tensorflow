I&#39;m here to give a talk on relationships
about how you can improve
your relationships
well what about my relationship with
y&#39;all I mean and and to end speaker
audience connection how do i improve
that I think I should start by asking
your names or would it be much
convenient for me to ask about how your
day has been or a joke would do I think
a joke would do so I&#39;ll tell you a joke
how do mathematicians scold their
children if I have told you n times but
no I have told you n plus 1 times n plus
2 times and yes I thought this was funny
because I nearly took it after reading a
hundred more jokes so if a joke doesn&#39;t
improve our relationship then what does
or is it really that important the topic
to be discussed here may be the nerdy
guys from the Harvard University tried
to know the answer so they started the
study of adult human development
following the lives of 268 sophomores
from Howard classes between 1939 and
1944 amongst those young student was
John F Kennedy
how about grant study is the
longest-running project about human
happiness it is a project revolutionary
and ambition impact and even expenditure
moreover it is still an ongoing study
Robert valve injure the grant city
director and Howard psychologist while
sharing what this study is revealed with
the unflinching solidity of 75 years of
data and 20 million US dollars spend
tells us about the secrets of human
happiness longevity and a meaningful
life says that
the clearest message that we get from
the 75 year old study is this good
relationships keeps us happier and
healthier Val dinger wants people to
realize that the commercial projection
of a good life
wealth Fame career success won&#39;t bring
us health or happiness
it&#39;s the efforts we&#39;ve put into building
our relationships that will so how is it
that we nourish human heart we improve
our relationship will be more result we
live longer for that I&#39;m going to make a
big bold statement that is the essence
of this step talk and then follow it
with seven include steps to apply so as
to improve your relationship but before
that three things first well it&#39;s not at
all quick fix this idea is going to
improve your relationships drastically
but not in a matter of minutes or hours
or days building a good relationship
well it takes time and building a great
relationship it takes a great lifetime
second although I might speak of
relationship in general terms like the
one that appearance benefactors friend
foes allies counterparts but this idea
is so revolutionary that can be applied
across boundaries amongst nations third
the idea is revolutionary but simple its
simplicity might just trick you into
believing that it wouldn&#39;t work if only
you will choose to apply it so now the
big bold statement give them a reason to
stay until they find their own it&#39;s a
very important point give them a reason
to stay until they find their own to
illustrate this I would like to tell you
a story
so as usual one fine morning a young
eight year old vial going to school saw
some older guys drinking or smoking and
gambling doing nothing and yet have the
money to enjoy everything now this image
contradicted with the image of his
father who toiled day in and out at the
government Medical College knocker to
satisfy ends meet his curiosity led him
to dark pots of gambling and robbery and
various other socially elective ities as
days passed by into months and months
into years he started working for real
estate gangs and politicians threatening
people and sometimes even hurting them
eventually he became a local Don and was
wounded by the police for 45 cases filed
against him his name was Akhilesh Paul
one day while smoking under a pan Capri
a man named mr. Vijay barsik called a
coalition his friends and asked them
whether they would like to play with the
football he was having just to make fun
of mr. bossy he and his friends they
asked with some kind of like pay in
return astonishingly mr. boss agreed to
pay each one of them rupees five as
rupees five was not a bad deal at all
they agreed to play this went on for the
next 15 days but all 16 them
Abbasi refused to give the money saying
that now he does not have sufficient
money enough to pay them all these boys
were addicted to football now were mean
to get the ball even without the money
these days changed his life after
surrendering to the police and promising
the judge that now he will be a
completely changed man achilles got bail
he worked so hard that eventually he got
got a chance to play internationally in
the year 2009 he played so well in
Brazil that mr. Moyes that then coach if
Manchester United asked him to be a
coach since that day Akhilesh started
his own organization known as slum
soccer and it teaches kids for free and
the red light areas and slums of Nagpur
now I want you to just look at that
statement give them a reason to stay
until they find their own and that&#39;s
exactly what mr. Barr said did he gave a
collision his friends a reason buy a
mood of payment to love football until
they themselves came up with their own
ideas to love that game to change their
life for the better so give them a
reason to stay until they find their own
is the hashtag one way to improve your
relationships and the seven concrete
steps that I&#39;m about to give you are the
way to the way for our easy to semblance
we are going to call them reasons are e
a s o and s now let&#39;s go on for the
first one we ignite the feelings are the
feelings they are the epitome of any
relationship without them there can be
none to start off by reassembling
rekindling and reigniting those feelings
let me give you an engineering example
an objective light or density is then
put inside a liquid of higher density it
comes up towards the surface because of
the buoyancy force and the drag force
opposed
the mighty force of gravitation so you
should to try to bring that to surface
all your feelings those have been there
so to improve your relationship the
first step is to reignite those feelings
establish a connection II it&#39;s one thing
completely to imagine that yes your
relationships has been improved and it&#39;s
completely another to really improve
your relationship without establishing a
connection it&#39;s like this that we
require a medium for the mass to be
transferred from one place to another or
you can put it bluntly this way that you
have a cellphone and there are malware&#39;s
in yourself on different kind of
malware&#39;s and you have an anti-virus in
your personal computer so it would be
impossible to remove all those matters
without actually establishing a
connection so once you read that all
those feelings establish connection are
they about any misunderstandings if a
relationship is our cell phone then
those malware&#39;s are misunderstandings
remove them real fast real cursory and
real quick it&#39;s like this that when
Copernicus proposed that the planetary
orbit of the circle Kepler was there to
remove the misunderstanding telling us
all that yes the planetary orbit is not
a circle but an ellipse so try to
observe your relationship analyze your
relationship and remove any kind of
misunderstandings those might be there
any relationships now search for the
reasons s in the classic study published
in the Harvard magazine on how human
beings how we respond to languages
psychologist Chanel would slander and
Blake found out that when given a reason
for our request we increase compliance
from 60% to 90% so how is it that we
search for reasons well it depends
solely on their relationships have been
where it is now and where you want to
take it also it is different for
different people different times and
different places
but yes I can give you a frame of
reference to look from on how you can
search for reasons so to search for
reasons relate relate your current
circumstances of very relationship is
and where it have been then respond
respond to the relation that you might
have gotten after you thought about your
current circumstances and what your
relationship had been in the past it&#39;s
like this that when a mass M is related
to the force F it responds with an
acceleration a and respect whatever kind
of reasons you might come up with those
reasons are going to be unique just made
for you all now before moving on to the
next letter I want you all to do one
simple exercise this is going to make
your words more convincing it&#39;s going to
be very entertaining so what do you all
like to do it ok so just say these words
with me and say just exactly so open
exercise ok so say you save louder you
are it will increase your vertical pitch
my mom was told me that yeah it was good
this thing about it now I give you a
very simple sentence to say I gave you
reasons to believe them and you did
exactly a very futile exercise that&#39;s
the power reasons hold for our
relationship ok vomit
your ego Oh your ego is the only thing
that is going to prevent you from
searching for reasons or even if you
have searched them to place it before
your counterparts so just to remember
one thing
skip Yui and let it go next letter
noodles Labatt resi Rosetti Isaac Newton
Sir Isaac Newton was an English polymath
he was a scientist and inventor and
astronomers the philosopher and
astrophysicist so if he is having some
werden something then we must believe
him for every action there&#39;s an equal
and opposite reaction if Sir Isaac
Newton is saying this we must believe so
when you will search for this reason and
when you will place these reasons before
your counterparts and that person will
respond in kind and good reasons your
relationship will be much much improved
and now the last step the second one
that is my favorite I just always want
to do this celebrate as like celebrate
so whenever you improve your
relationship do this celebration is the
most important factor if you want to
improve your relationship celebrate it
celebrate your relationship do whatever
there is possible for your relationships
to be improved
now let me summon up it all give them a
reason to stay until they find their own
first reignite the feelings establish a
connection not about any
misunderstandings it&#39;s for a reason so
Mateo ego Newton&#39;s law about reciprocity
and celebrate as like celebrate Oh
before going and before leaving the
stage I would like to do a very simple
prayer I would like to say that me the
holy Lord bless your relationships may
they be more fruitful ones may they last
the day glory and may they change thank
you very much
you
