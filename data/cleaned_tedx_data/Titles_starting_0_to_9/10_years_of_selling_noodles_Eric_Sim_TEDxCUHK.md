my name is Eric sim I&#39;m very glad to be
here and to also be the last speaker
I love street food I eat fish bone
noodle almost every week in Hong Kong if
I travel to Thailand this is what I eat
braised pork with rice and mango and if
I travel to Singapore for work I would
usually stay at a grand higher because
the service is great but more
importantly there is the Hakka store
nearby that looks like this this is an
Indian fried bread if I have a
conference call in the office I will buy
takeaway and either in the hotel room I
fly a lot and it&#39;s what I eat on the
plane I&#39;m very sure none of you has
eaten this on the plane whether is it
economy class business class or first
class because before I fly I went to
this shop to buy it on the plane the
cabin crew was nice enough to put it on
a plate so why do I love Hawker food so
much you know we require Hawker food in
Singapore but rest of the world is
called street food I grew up with it I
was selling it when I was young and in
fact many a time when I look back at
this picture I feel like I&#39;m that piece
of being let me tell you more from the
age of 12 to 22 I was helping my father
to sell prawn noodle at his little store
this toy is a little bit smaller than
this my father is very thin like this
man in the middle
frying shorter and that and the guy on
the Left younger I have my father once
on Sunday on weekends sorry on on public
holiday
and on those days that his only helper
couldn&#39;t make it to work my mother will
ask me to skip school and go help out
she is the only mother I know that
wouldn&#39;t think twice asking her kids to
skip school she didn&#39;t think I&#39;m I&#39;m
learning a lot in school and last month
I was interviewed by a financial career
which is an employment website owned by
The Wall Street Journal so the
journalist was wondering how could a boy
son of Hawker absolutely no connection
got into Investment Banking and make
managing director of ups lightly answer
for poor kids you study very well you
got a scholarship to Ivy Lee that&#39;s what
you guys are thinking
no I fail my english and literature very
badly when I was age fourteen I&#39;m too
embarrassed to show you my other report
Alice so what did i do right or what did
I do wrong
how do I get to where I am I didn&#39;t do
anything wrong
what is wrong is with the journalist
assumption the statement despite me
being a Hakka son an MD that&#39;s
completely wrong it is because I&#39;m a
Hakkasan I&#39;m MD at UBS because there&#39;s
so much to learn during my tenure
internship at my father&#39;s though of all
the things there are three that I
thought helped me in banking number one
dealing with people see my father is a
very stern man man of few words and we
don&#39;t speak a lot at home but when he&#39;s
at the store he suddenly become very
friendly
welcoming making small talks with
customers as they evolve that&#39;s the way
to do business so when I got into
banking I got no choice but to deal with
people so whether we are discussing
merger and acquisition pawn issuance or
hedging foreign exchange I assume that
they are at the store I think Ron noodle
so what I do I become friendly put on a
smile because my father never talked
about prawn noodle with customers but
you see bankers we like to talk about
you the first meeting we meet you
because they catch this foreign exchange
risk buy this product right no I don&#39;t
do that because whether you are buying
prawn noodle or buying financial product
or you need advice for M&amp;A there are two
people they are concerned about their
kids they are concerned whether they can
get a boyfriend or girlfriend you know a
lot of other needs decide financial
product so that however helped me build
the rapport and the relationship and
with good relationship customers open up
they tell me what the companies need
they tell me the cash flow needs a
future plan would have your IPO in two
or three years the more I know about
them the more the better advice I can
give and the better advice the more
transaction I do and the faster my
career progression have you ever been to
a restaurant that no matter how much you
wait
this time I need to use attached hand
signal no matter how much you weigh you
cannot get the attention of the waiter
and waitress this happens to you so I
make sure that at the store and not one
of those people I&#39;ll scan around ten
tables outside that little store aisle
looking for people who wants to pay at
those time they pay only after finishing
I look out for people who wants to order
again I look out for people who customer
who wants me to clear the table cleaner
and also posture by walking around if
they pause I need to go up to them and
invite them to come into the store and
interpro know otherwise they run away
and I also need to match Pacers with
your order you come in order one prawn
noodle small yellow noodles mixed with
vermicelli I did remember okay this the
guy was pedicle little bit bad that lady
you know skinny fat complexion ordering
that noodle with flat rice noodle so
constantly I&#39;m scanning people I need to
tie in their face with the order because
my father is very angry at me if I
cannot remember the sequence and there
was once he took the noodle and I say
who they use of green there&#39;s only one
customer one poor noodle one customer
you don&#39;t need me to tell you what to do
right so a lot of analysis going on so
now these days the practice of scanning
people has become and heavy if I walk in
cosplay P I planned me to so many people
not because I know more people that you
is because I scan people around and I
palm into friends could be people from
my Lincoln connection I can even
recognize them even though I&#39;ve not
never met them usually I go up to say hi
you know how are you and of course I fly
a lot on Friday night flight ka 993

which departed 6:30 there&#39;s no delay
from Beijing to Hong Kong
when I get to my seat where&#39;s the worst
walk as I&#39;m walking along the owl I will
look at pulsar town looking for familiar
faces and many times I find people that
I know who are bankers lawyers auditors
on that Friday some are colleagues
ex colleagues customers friends I also
see competitors and enemies I try to
talk to them well that&#39;s the best time
they are not distracted by email what&#39;s
that we check competitors today can be
partners tomorrow enemies if they want
to talk to if they don&#39;t mind me talking
to them you know I&#39;ll be happy because
you may not be enemy all your life and
that helps me form Network right people
and in banking that was very important
what does bank do banks try to match
interest group of companies or people
who wants to raise funding there&#39;s
another group who has to impact so we
match them selling noodle and selling
financial services it&#39;s pretty much the
same thing because both are people&#39;s
business both are dealing with people so
that&#39;s one number two dealing with one
film at this store my father is
responsible for cooking I&#39;m responsible
for servicing the chronic sorry
servicing the customer I used trying too
much in in banking and my father store
we never used why we always use customer
what do I do much my responsibility is
include taking the order servicing I
mean serving the noodle and sure that
nobody runs away without paying and the
table washing pose also so part of my
responsibility and we have three pails
of water
the first pail is with detergent we make
into a soft solution I will so use both
into the first pill for a few minutes
then not washing second and third pill a
clean one so I take a sponge clean the
inside and the outside put it into the
second per second pure water water
quickly right after 30 to 40 pools of
washing you find it samples may not be
so clean
have you ever been to a restaurant where
there&#39;s a little bit of leftover food on
your plate that&#39;s why in Hong Kong you
have to wash it again yourself right so
I was cooking one day for myself at the
cooking station in front of me is the
pot of boiling water next to it is the
auto and prompt row on the left is a
glass cabinet with noodles and
ingredients like Spokane Vice prawn
there&#39;s a stack of bowls that has
already been won I took a turnaround
wash it under running tap or running
water
my father saw it and say don&#39;t wash
again it&#39;s very ugly why did he say
there I mean he walked away he didn&#39;t
make a fuss of it but that message
laughs and the impression for me I was
thinking hey this is what ethics so when
I go to banking I make sure I design
products oh I give advice exactly the
same way doubt it to myself so that my
customer will continue to deal with me
because winning trust is very key in
banking and you know that many bankers
have gotten stuff into trouble caused a
lot of damage to the economy so that is
what basic can be number three dealing
with time you see a hawker business must
be really efficient during the peak
hours if they cannot stout enough
noodles they are run out of business
right there all this time
because it&#39;s so competitive look at my
father
no it&#39;s not my father this is the oka I
don&#39;t have a photo of my father was at
that time I wasn&#39;t thinking that I would
do it top 30 years later so I didn&#39;t
take that but if you see it this Hawker
he&#39;s wearing a white polo shirt he
always wear that my father wears a white
t-shirt to work every day I wear white
shirt what every day right I don&#39;t need
to worry about what color shirt to do
wear in the morning I don&#39;t have to
worry about what shirt can match mine
what I can match my shirt because all
ties match white shirt except white tie
and not only do I wear the same thing to
work I eat the same thing
I entertain mostly in three restaurant
in Hong Kong - in Beijing one in
Shanghai and do in Singapore because I
go to the roost restaurant so frequently
I know the menu I know that the price
wouldn&#39;t exceed my budget because we got
expense limit these days and I know the
quality of food will always be good so
my focus is always on the customer
trying to find out what any mix if I go
to the if I have a meeting before this
lunch the end early I would not go back
to office I will go to the restaurant
because I can save time the restaurant
becomes my office if you look at this
picture you know I got my boarding pass
I got my blackberry with that I can
already walk the owner will stuff meat
here and leave me alone because he knows
me away and for that one hour I&#39;m at the
restaurant I can make phone calls I can
close deals and it&#39;s very precious for a
banker you see my father if I saw your
sauce in Taba Magnum site with three
liter in the desert he buys rock sugar
in a sack garlic in a second
I don&#39;t have rock sugar to buy our
garlic for banking I buy facial wash
shampoo batteries in the 50s 100 that
can last me two years or three years my
weekends I don&#39;t spend time going to the
supermarket worrying about it
you know Petrus is so important to
parents
imagine you buy a toy for your kid you
thought batteries included when you
thought when you go home batteries not
included
cow is crying your wife asks you to go
and buy you tries to the supermarket
only to find at the supermarket is
closed you waste a lot of time in in and
that&#39;s not the end you got more to come
when you get home because your wife and
your kid are very upset I say what&#39;s the
point mr. Scott I&#39;ll print a thousand
pieces not two boxes all the time
because that is wasting time so
efficiency is very key in photos were it
is also very key in banking because
every minute come I travel a lot so I&#39;m
organized
like you see occurs take a place for
everything the chopping board is always
at the same place the knife is always at
the same place year after year because
you don&#39;t waste time looking for your
knife you don&#39;t have time during the
hour you have only like two hours to
sell as many noodles as you can and with
this pack for example the RMV pack
inside there there will be a restaurant
part there will be a boarding pass
because you know what is it like chewing
up at the immigration realize that you
forgot your immigration card because the
cabin crew didn&#39;t give it to you and
last few years I also keep this item
which is a mass in the pack that stays
RMP
okay it&#39;s a lot of similarity between
banking and selling noodle less than for
us to learn so the next time you eat a
pork noodle where is the pro noodle want
a noodle look out for the street food
vendors behind that noodle they may give
you a tip or two thank you very much
